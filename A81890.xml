         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is one of the greateſt Practical Debates and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts betwixt God and his own People, priviledged with a ſpecial intereſt in him, which they are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined longeſt to keep up, and are loatheſt to let fall, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether he ſhall guide and govern them, and ſhape out their lot to them while they ſojourn here in the World, as he himſelf in his own infinite wiſdom ſhall think fit, having a blank Submiſſion put by them into his hand, to be filled up with what kind and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with what meaſure and quantity, and with what continuance and duration of troubles, trials and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons himſelf pleaſeth: Or whether he ſhould, as to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things at leaſt, conſult their will and pleaſure, and as it were take their advice, and allow them a liberty to preſcribe to him how he ſhould guide and diſpoſe of them: And indeed to be here denyed to their own will, and abſolutely ſubmitted to the will of God, is one of the higheſt and moſt difficultly practicable points of ſelf-denial (to which notwithſtanding all the Diſciples and followers of Chriſt are expreſly called, and wherein he hath great delight and complacency, as favouring ſtrong of intire truſt and confidence in him); Yet if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe few things, it will be found that there is all the reaſon in the World, why they ſhould come in his will and ſweetly ſubmit themſelves to it in all things, how croſs ſoever to their own inclination, without any the
<pb facs="tcp:152256:3"/> leaſt ſinful reluctation or contradiction; which is our priviledge and the reſtauration of our degenerated nature to its Divine and Primitive integrity.</p>

            <p>It were a very wide miſtake if from what is diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this <hi>Conſideration,</hi> any ſhould conclude that we intend either to commend or allow Chriſtians praying directly and expreſly for Croſſes and Afflictions, let be for ſuch and ſuch Afflictions in particular: For, beſide that we neither find it commanded in the Scriptures, nor allowedly (if at all) preſident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or practized by the Saints recorded there; And that it ſeems to be a ſinful limiting of the Soveraign God to a particular mean; We may eaſily know from ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, with what difficulty, repining and fainting we often bear theſe Croſſes and Afflictions that we are moſt clearly called to take on, and that are unavoidably laid upon us; And how lamentably little for moſt part we profit by them; What hope or aſſurance could we then have that we ſhould either carry Chriſtianly under, or make ſuitable improvement of, ſuch Croſſes as we ſhould unwarrantably ſeek, and pray for to our ſelves? It's true, we find ſome of the Saints, and theſe, Stars of the firſt Magnitude, as <hi>Moſes, Job, Elias, David,</hi> and <hi>Jonas,</hi> in their diſtempered mal-content or fainting fits, paſſionatly, prepoſterouſly, and precipitantly praying, or rather wiſhing for death (for which they were not for the time in ſo good caſe); But that was not for death under the notion of affliction, but rather to prevent fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and further afflictions, or to have a period put to preſently incumbent ones. If it ſhould here be ſaid, why may not Saints pray for afflictions, ſince they ſeem to be promiſed in the Covenant of Grace, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6, 7. and <hi>v.</hi> 14.

To the <hi>firſt</hi> part of the <hi>Objection,</hi> it may be briefly <hi>Anſwered,</hi> that theſe and others ſuch, are not
<pb facs="tcp:152256:10"/> properly and formally promiſes of the Covenant of Grace, but rather Covenant-threatnings (for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace hath its own threatnings ſuited to the nature thereof as well as the Covenant of Works hath its) though dipped (to ſay ſo) in Covenant-grace and mercy: And to the <hi>other</hi> part of it as briefly, that God hath promiſed to bleſs and to cauſe to profit by ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and chaſtiſements as himſelf thinks fit to inflict and lay on, but not theſe which we ſeek and pray for to our ſelves: Neither doth that Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>v.</hi> 75. <hi>I know —that in faithfulneſs thou haſt afflicted me,</hi> ſay any thing towards ſtrengthening the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or invalidating the Anſwers given to it; For the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> only there humbly and thankfully acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Gods faithfulneſs in fulfilling his threatning in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting him when he went aſtray; and in performing his promiſe in bleſſing his affliction to him for preventing his after-ſtraying, and making him learn better to keep his Commandments; In both which he is faithful. All that is either expreſt or meant in this <hi>Conſideration,</hi> is, that the Saints often pray God, that he would take his own way, and uſe his own means to bring about theſe great ends mentioned; wherein there is indeed at leaſt a tacite inſinuation, that if he in his wiſdom ſee it meet to make uſe of the rod and affliction in order thereto, that they will not allow themſelves to decline the ſame, nor to miſtake him in it; But that rather they ſhall through grace be ſatisfied with, and bleſs him for fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Petitions, and granting them according to their own hearts deſires, though it be by ſuch means: Which is not praying for affliction, but a reſolved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Submiſſion to infinite Wiſdoms love-choiſe of his own midſes to effectuat &amp; bring to paſs the prayed for ends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> If it be <hi>conſidered,</hi> that it now neither griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nor troubleth any of all the glorified, triumphing,

As Juſtification, Adoption, Sanctification and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification; Which, how great ſoever in themſelves, are yet leſser then the giving of Chriſt himſelf to the death; And if it be undeniably certain that he giveth not theſe to all which are the leſſer and lower gifts, why ſhould it be thought that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the higher and greater? <hi>5.</hi> Shall that grand expreſſion of the ſpecial love of God, be made common, by extending it to all the world, the greateſt profligats and Atheiſts not excepted, no not <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> nor <hi>Ahab,</hi> not <hi>Judas</hi> the traitor, nor <hi>Julian</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtat, nay, nor any of all the damned reprobates who were actually in Hell when he died and ſhed his blood? <hi>6.</hi> If he died thus for all, it ſeems that the new Song of the redeemed, <hi>Rev. 5.</hi> would have run and ſounded better thus, thou haſt redeemed <hi>us all and every man,</hi> of every kindred and tongue and people and nation to God by thy blood, then as it there ſtands by inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;</hi> But who may preſume by ſuch an univerſality to extend and ampliat what he hath ſo reſtricted, and to make that common to all which God hath peculiarized to a few favourites? But the Author having much to better purpoſe on this Head in theſe Sermons, I need add no more here.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only further ſay of theſe aſtoniſhing, in a manner non-pluſsing, and ſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing great ſufferings of bleſſed Jeſus, that, as they were equivalent to what all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect deſerved by their ſins, and ſhould have ſuffered in their own perſons throughout all eternity, conſiſtently with the innocency and excellency of his Perſon, and with the dignity of his Mediatory Office; Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>v. 9. And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death,</hi> or as it is in the Original, <hi>In his deaths,</hi> in the Plural Number, as if he had died the death of every one of the Elect, or as if there had been a conjunction and combination of all their deaths in his one death; And <hi>v. 6.</hi> That <hi>the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all,</hi> or as the word is, <hi>made the iniquity of us all to meet on him,</hi> there having been a ſolemn tryſt, convocation, and rendezvous (as it were) of all the iniquities of all the Elect more common and more peculiar, in all their various aggravating cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, not ſo much as one committed ſince <hi>Adams</hi> firſt tranſgreſsion, or to be committed to the day of Judgement, being abſent in the puniſhment of them upon his perſon; no wonder that ſuch a load of innumerable thouſands and millions of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities made him heavily to groan, and that the conſideration thereof made great <hi>Luther</hi> ſay, <hi>That Chriſt was the greateſt ſinner in all the world,</hi> to wit, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the guilt of all the ſins of all the Elect to him, and by his having had the puniſhment of them all laid upon his perſon: <hi>So</hi> we may from them be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Concerning the hight of holy diſplicence and deteſtation, that the Majesty of God hath at ſin, the only thing in the whole world that his ſoul hates, and which in the vile and abominable nature of it hath an irreconciliable antipathy with, and enmity againſt, his infinitely pure, holy, and bleſſed nature, and hath a tendency, could it poſsibly be effected, to ſeek after the deſtruction and annihilation of the very bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and is interpretatively <hi>Deicide;</hi> The Language of it being, <hi>O that there were not a God;</hi> That he cannot behold it in his own ſinleſs innocent, and dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, though but by imputation (for he was not made formally the ſinner, as <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians</hi> blaſphemouſly averr) but he will needs in ſo terrible a manner, teſtify his great diſlike of, and deep displeaſure at it, and take ſuch formidable vengeance on it, even
<pb facs="tcp:152256:19"/> in his perſon: Ah! the nature of ſin which God who is of pure eyes, cannot, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, behold, without perfect abhorrency of it, is but little thorowly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood and pondered; Would we otherwiſe dare to dally and ſport with it, or to take the latitudes in committing of it at the rate we do? I have ſometimes thought, that it is an errour in the first concoction (to ſay ſo) of Religion in many Proffeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of it end pretenders to it; that we have never framed ſuitable apprehenſions of the moſt hateful, vile, and abominable nature of ſin (which hath a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the ſuperficiarineſs and overlineſs of all duties and practices of Religion) and that many of us had need to be dealt with as skilful School-masters uſe to deal with their Schollars that are foundered in the firſt Principles of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leſt they prove but ſmatters all their days; to bring them back again to theſe; even to be put to learn this firſt Leſſon in Religion better and more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to understand the jealouſie of God, as to this curſed thing <hi>Sin;</hi> For which, though he graciouſly for the ſake of theſe ſufferings of Chriſt, pardon the guilt of it to his people, and hear their Prayers, yet will needs <hi>take vengeance on their inventions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 99.8</note> be they never ſo ſeriouſly holy, and eminently ſerviceable to him and to their generation according to his will, whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> the Man of God, is a moſt memorable instance: That <hi>Ancient</hi> conceived rightly of the nature of ſin, who ſaid, <hi>That if he behoved neceſſarily either to commit the leaſt ſin, or go to Hell to be tormented there eternally, he would rather wiſh to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to go to Hell, if he could be there without ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Concerning the ſeverity of Divine Juſtice in puniſhing ſin, whereof its puniſhment in the Perſon of the Son of God at ſuch a rate, is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, cleareſt, and moſt convincing evidences imaginable, to whom he would not abate one farthing of the Elects debt, but did with holy and ſpotleſs ſeverity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the whole of it; And though he was the <hi>Fathers Fellow,</hi> yet he would needs have him <hi>ſmitten with the awakened Sword</hi> of ſin-revenging Juſtice and Wrath:<note place="margin">Zech. 13.7</note> As if all the executions that had heed done in the earth on men for ſin, as on the old World of the ungodly drowned by the Deludge. On the miſcreant Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> and of theſe other <hi>Cities,</hi> upon whom he ſhower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down liquid flames of fire and brimſtone, even ſomewhat of Hell in a manner out of Heaven <hi>(Coelum pluebat Gehennam)</hi> burning them quick, and frying them to death in their own skins: On <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and their aſſociats, upon whom the earth opened and ſwallowed them up in a moſt ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner alive, the reſt being conſumed by fire ſent down from Heaven. On the one hundred eighty five thouſand men of <hi>Senacheribs</hi> Army, all ſlain in one night by an Angel: And on the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who, by many and various plagues were waſted and worn out to the number of ſix hundred thouſand fighting men in the ſhort ſpace of fourty years; Reflections on which made <hi>Moſes,</hi> a witneſs of all, with aſtoniſhment to cry out,<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.11</note> 
               <hi>Who knows the power of thy anger?</hi> As if, I ſay, all theſe terrible executions of Juſtice, had been done by a Sword aſleep, or in the Scabbard, in compariſon of the execution it did on Jeſus Chriſt the Elects Cautioner, againſt whom it <hi>awakened</hi> was unſheathed, forbiſhed, and made to glitter; So that we may ſay, had all the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> without the exception of ſo much as one, been eternally deſtroyed, it would not have been a greater demonſtration of the ſeverity of the Juſtice of God in puniſhing ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Concerning the greatneſs, incomprehenſible vaſtneſs, and unparalel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lableneſs of the love of God to the Elect World, which he ſo loved (O wonderful <hi>ſo!</hi> Eternity will but be ſufficient to unfold all that is infolded in that myſterious <hi>ſo;</hi> an <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Concerning the very great obligation that lyeth on Believers to love Jeſus Chriſt, who hath thus commended his love to them, by undergoing all theſe ſad ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for their ſakes; even out of love to them to become a Curſe, to bleed out his precious life, and to pour out his ſoul to death for them; which to do he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no neceſſity, nor in the leaſt obliged by them, being infinitly removed from all poſſibility of being reached by any obligation from his creatures, whom be loved, and for whom he deſigned this grand expreſſion of his love, the laying down of his life for them, before they or the world had any beeing: nay, being by their ſins infinitly diſobliged: Ah! that moſt of theſe whom he loved ſo much, ſhould love him (who is altogether lovely) their duty, his friends and intereſts for his ſake ſo little; Even ſo very little, that if it were poſsible he could rue or repent of what he hath done and ſuffered to commend his love to them, they would tempt him to it: And indeed there is nothing that more ſpeaks forth the freeneſs of his love then this, that he ſhould love them ſo fervently, and continue thus to love them, even <hi>to the end,</hi> who are often ſo very cool in their love to him; Sure, ſuch when in any meaſure at themſelves, cannot but love themſelves the leſs, and loath themſelves the more, that they love him ſo little, and earneſtly long for that deſirable day, wherein he ſhall be <hi>admired in,</hi> and by <hi>all them that believe,</hi> and when they ſhall get him loved as well as ever they deſired to love him, and as well as he ſhall will them to love him, and when they ſhall be in an eternal extacy and tranſport of admiration at his love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Concerning the little reaſon that Believers have to think much of their ſmall and petty ſufferings undergone for him: For what are they all, even the greateſt and moſt grievous of them, being compared with his ſufferings for them? They are but as little chips of the Croſs in compariſon of the great and heavy end of it that lighted on him, and not worthy to be named in one day with his: All the ſad and ſorrowful dayes and nights that all the Saints on earth have had under their many and various, and ſadly circumſtantiated croſſes and ſufferings, do not by thouſands of degrees, come near unto, let be to equal that one ſad and ſorrowful night which he had in <hi>Gethſemane</hi> (beſide all the ſorrows and griefs he endured before that time) where he was put to conflict with the awakened Sword of ſin-revenging Juſtice, that did most fiercely lay at him, without ſparing him; Which terrible Combat laſted all that nighe, and the next day till three a clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, when that ſharpeſt Sword, after many ſore wounds given him, killed

Ah! that ever the ſmall and inconſiderable ſufferings of the Saints, ſhould ſo much as once be made mention of by them where his ſtrange and ſtupendious ſufferings offer themſelves to be noticed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Concerning the unſpeakably great obligation that lyeth on Believers, readily, pleaſantly and chearfully, not only to do, but alſo to ſuffer for Christ as he ſhall call them to it, even to do all that lyeth in their power for him, and to ſuffer all that is in the power of any others to do againſt them on his account, who did willingly and with delight do and ſuffer ſo much for them; they have doubtleſs good reaſon heartily to pledge him in the cup of his croſs, and to drink after him, there being eſpecially ſuch difference betwixt the cup that he drunk and that which they are put to drink; his cup was ſtirred thick with the wrath of God, having had the dregs thereof in a manner wrung out to him therein, ſo that it was no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the very ſight of it made him conditionally to ſupplicate for its departure from him, and that the drinking of it put him in a moſt grievous agony, and cast him in a top-ſweat of blood; yet ſaith he on the matter, either they or I muſt drink it; they are not able to drink it, for the drinking of it will diſtract them and put them mad, will poiſon and kill them eternally; but I am able to drink it, and to work out the poiſon and venom of it, and though it ſhall kill me, I can raiſe up and reſtore my ſelf to life again, therefore Father, come away with it, and I will drink it up and drink it out, this to the everlasting welfare of theſe dear ſouls; <hi>not my will but thine be done,</hi> for thus it was agreed betwixt thee and me in the Covenant of Redemption; when as theirs is love from bottom even to brim (whatever mixture may ſometimes be of paternal and domeſtick Justice proper and peculiar to God's own Family, and which as the Head and Father thereof he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth therein) not ſo much as one gut or ſcruple of vindictive wrath being left there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: Ah! it's both a ſin and ſhame, that there ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

To you it is given in the behalf of Chriſt, not only to believe on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Concerning what mighty obligation lyeth on Believers to mourn and weep, to be ſad and ſorrowful for ſin, how can they look on him whom they have thus bruiſed, wounded and pierced by their ſins without the tear in their eye, without mourning for him and being in bitterneſs as a man is for his firſt-born, and for his only begotten ſon? when they think (as all of them on ſerious conſideration will find reaſon to think) that if their ſins keeped the tryſt and rendezvous when all the ſins of all the Elect did meet and were laid on him, then ſure there came no greater company and more numerous troop of ſins to that ſolemn rendezvous from any of all the redeemed then came from them; and that he had not a heavier load and burden of the ſins of any then he had of theirs, whereby he was even preſſed as a cart is preſſed down under the ſheaves, and was made most grievouſly to groan, even with the groanings of a deadly wounded man: and that if he was wounded and pierced by their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then ſurely he was more deeply wounded and pierced by the iniquities of none then by theirs; O! what mourning ſhould this cauſe to them? even ſuch mourning as was
<pb facs="tcp:152256:21"/> at <hi>Hadadrimmon</hi> in the Valley of <hi>Megiddo,</hi> on the occaſion of the ſad ſlaughter and death of that good and deſirable king <hi>Joſiah?</hi> this is indeed one of the moſt genuine and kindly, one of the moſt powerful and prevalent, one of the ſweeteſt and ſtrongeſt ſprings of, and motives to, true Goſpel-repentance, ſorrow and mourning for ſin.</p>
            <p>

O! let it never be heard for ſhame, that ever any of them ſhall find the least ſweetneſs in that accurſed thing that was ſo bitter to him; that ever any of them ſhall be found to dally with, or to hug that ſerpent and viper in their boſom, that ſo cruelly ſtung him to death.</p>
            <p>But this being the great ſubject of theſe following Sermons, wherein <hi>the Preacher</hi> being in a good meaſure wiſe,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.10, 11.</note> hath <hi>ſought to find out acceptable words, and words</hi> I hope <hi>of uprightneſs and truth</hi> (O that they may be to the Readers <hi>as goads and nails faſtened by him who is the great maſter of aſſemblies.</hi>) I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt no further, only I think I may humbly ſay, that to my knowledge, none have preached on this whole <hi>Chapter</hi> to better purpoſe every way; many may have done vertuouſly, but it's probable he will be found to <hi>excell them all:</hi> nay if I ſhould ſay, that for any thing I know, this Book for ſo much, is amongst the beſt Books of this nature the World hath ſeen, I ſuppoſe hardly will any judicious Chriſtian, thorowly exerciſed to Godlineſs, after he hath read it all over, and pondered it, think that I have greatly, if at all, hyperbolized.</p>

            <p>It may be ſome Readers will think, that there are in theſe Sermons, ſeveral co-incidencies of purpoſes, and repetitions; To which I ſhall but preſume to ſay, that beſide, that there is a great affinity amongſt many of the purpoſes delivered by the Prophet in this piece of his Propheſies, if not a holy co-incidency of them, and a profitable repetition now and then of the ſame thing in different expreſſions; As there is in ſome other Scriptures, without any the leaſt imputation to them, as that truly Noble and renowned Gentle-man <hi>Mr. Boyl</hi> ſheweth in his elaborat, eloquent, and excellent <hi>Conſiderations, touching the ſtile of the Holy Scriptures:</hi> And that the ſame midſes, and nearby in the ſame expreſſions, may very pertinently be made uſe of, to clear and confirm different points of Doctrine; It will be found, that if there be in ſo many Sermons or Diſcourſes on Subjects of ſuch affinity, any co-incidencies or repetitions, they are at ſuch a convenient diſtance, and one way or other ſo diverſified, and appoſitely ſuited to the Subject of his preſent Diſcourſe, that the Readers will not readily nauſeat, nor think what is ſpoken in its place, impertinent, ſuperfluous, or needleſs, though ſomewhat like it hath been ſaid by him in ſome other place; Or if there be any not only ſeeming but real repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Purpoſes and Expreſſions, as <hi>they have not been grievous</hi> to the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.1.</note> ſo he with he Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> judged them <hi>needful</hi> at the time for the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>And now, as for you, <hi>much Honoured, Right Worthy,</hi> and <hi>very dearly beloved Inhabitants of the City of</hi> Glaſgow, let me tell you, that I have ſometimes of late much coveted, to be put and kept in ſome capacity, to do the Churches of Chriſt, and you in particular, this piece of ſervice, in putting to the Preſs theſe ſweet Sermons on this choice Scripture before I die; And indeed after I had gone tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a good number of them, not without conſiderable toil and difficulty (having all alongſt, had no Notes of his own, but the Sermons as they were taken haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a current Pen from his mouth, by one of his ordinary Hearers, no Schollar, who could not therefore ſo thorowly and diſtinctly take up ſeveral of the Purpoſes handled by the Preacher) the Lord was pleaſed to give me a ſtop, by a long continued ſharp affliction, not altogether without ſome little more remote and gentle threatnings of death; But he to whom the iſſues from death do belong, graciouſly condeſcended to ſpare me a little, that I might gather ſome strength to go thorow the remainder of them. I have much reaſon to think, that if poor I had been Preaching the Goſpel to you theſe twenty years paſt, wherein we have been in holy providence ſeparated (which hath been the more afflicting to me, that ye were in my heart to have lived and died with you, and if it had ſo ſeemed good in the eyes of the Lord, it would have been to me one of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and joyful providences I could have been tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E hope it ſhall not be needful to inſiſt in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scope of this Chapter, or in clearing to you of whom the Prophet meaneth, and is ſpeaking: It was once queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.32. when he was reading this Chapter, <hi>Of whom doeth the Prophet ſpeak this, of himſelf, or of ſome other man?</hi> And it's ſo clearly anſwered by <hi>Philip,</hi> who, from theſe words, began and preached to him of Jeſus Chriſt, that there needs be no doubt of it now: To Chriſtians theſe two may put it out of queſtion, that Jeſus Chriſt and the Subſtance of the Goſpel is compended and ſummed up here. 1. If we compare the Letter of this Chapter with what is in the four Evangeliſts, we will ſee it ſo fully, and often ſo literally made out of Chriſt, that if any will but read this Chapter, and compare it with them, they will find the Evangeliſts to be Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors on it, and ſetting it out more fully. 2. That there is no Scripture in the Old Teſtament ſo often and ſo convincingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to Chriſt as this is, there being ſcarce one Verſe, at leaſt not many, but are by the Evangeliſts or Apoſtles made uſe of for holding out of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If we look then to the ſum of the words of this Chapter, they take in the ſum and ſubſtance of the Goſpel; for they take in theſe two, 1. The right deſcription and manifeſtation of Jeſus Chriſt, And 2. the unfolding and opening up of the Covenant of Redemption. Where theſe two are, there the ſum of the Goſpel is; but theſe two are here, therefore the ſum of the Goſpel is here. Firſt, Jeſus Chriſt is deſcribed, 1. In his Perſon and Natures, as God being Eternal, as Man being under Suffering. 2. In all his Offices, as a Prieſt offering up Himſelf as a Sacrifice to ſatisfie Juſtice, as a Prophet venting his Knowledge to the juſtifying of many thereby, and as a King dividing the ſpoil with the ſtrong. 3. In His Humiliation, in the Cauſe of it, in the End of it, in the Subject of it, in the Nature and Riſe of all, God's good pleaſure. And 4. In His Exaltation, and Out-gate promiſed Him on the back of all His Sufferings and Humiliation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Covenant of Redemption is here deſcribed and ſet out, 1. In the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Parties of it, God and the Mediator. 2. As to the Matter about which it was, the Seed that was given to Chriſt, and all whoſe iniquities met on him. 3. As to the mutual Engagements on both ſides, the Son
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152256:24"/> undertaking to make his Soul an offering for Sin, and the Father promiſing that the efficacy of that His Satisfaction, ſhall be imputed and applyed for the juſtification of Sinners, and the terms on which, or the way how this Imputation and Application is brought about, to wit, <hi>By His Knowledge;</hi> All are clearly held out here.</p>
            <p>This is only a touch of the Excellency of this Scripture, and of the Materials (to ſay ſo) in it, as comprehending the ſubſtance and marrow of the Goſpel; we ſhall not be particular in dividing the Chapter, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that theſe things we have hinted at, are interwoven in it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt Verſe</hi> is a ſhort Introduction to lead us in to what follows. The Prophet hath in the former Chapter been ſpeaking of Chriſt as God's Servant, that ſhould be extolled and made very high, and before he proceed more particularly to unfold this Myſtery of the Goſpel, he cryes out by way of regrate, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> Alace (would he ſay) for as good News as we have to carry, few will take them off our hand, ſuch is Mens unconcernedneſs, yea, malice and obſtinacy, that they reject them. <hi>And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> to point at the neceſſity of the Power of God to accompany preaching, and even the moſt lively Ordinances, to make them effectual; how few are they, that the Power of God captivates to the obedience of this Truth?</p>
            <p>For the firſt part of this Verſe, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> To open it a little, ye ſhall take theſe four or five Conſiderations ere we come to the Doctrines:</p>
            <p>Conſider 1. The Matter of this Report in reference to its ſcope; it's not every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but a report of Chriſt, and of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption and of Grace: In the Original it is, Who hath believed <hi>our hearing</hi> actively, that is, that which we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be heard; and the word is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>tydings, Dan.</hi> 11.44. and <hi>rumour, Jer.</hi> 51.46. It's the tydings and rumour of a ſuffering Mediator, interpoſing himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Sinners; and it may be, <hi>hearing</hi> is mentioned, to point out the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence which the Prophet had in report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe News, he firſt heard them from God, and in that was paſſive, and then actively, he propoſed them to the People to be heard by them. 2. Conſider that the Prophet ſpeaketh of this Report, not as in his own Perſon only, but as in the Perſon of all that ever preached, or ſhall preach this Goſpel; therefore this Report is not peculiar to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> but it's <hi>our Report,</hi> the Report of the Prophets before, and of theſe after him, and of the Apoſtles and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel. 3. Conſider that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaketh of this Report, not only in reſpect of what he met with in his owntime, but as foreſeeing what would be the carriage of People in reference to it in after-times, therefore <hi>John.</hi> 2.38. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16. this ſame place is alledged to give a reaſon of the <hi>Jews</hi> unbelief, becauſe <hi>Iſaiah</hi> foretold it long before. 4. Conſider, that when he complaineth of the want of Faith to the report and tydings of the Goſpel, it is not of the want of hiſtorical Faith, as if the People would not give Chriſt a hearing at all, but it is of the want of ſaving Faith, therefore <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.37, 38. it is ſaid, <hi>though he had done many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him;</hi> and this propherick Scripture is ſubjoyn'd as the reaſon of it, <hi>that the ſaying of</hi> Iſaias <hi>might be fulfilled, who ſaid, Lord who hath believed our report?</hi> applying the <hi>believing</hi> ſpoken of here, to that ſaving Faith whereby folk believe and reſt upon Jeſus Chriſt. 5. Conſider that though there be no expreſſe Party named to whom the Prophet complaineth, yet no doubt, it is to God, therefore <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.38. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16. when this Scripture is cited, it is, <hi>Lord who hath believed our report?</hi> ſo it is the Prophet's complaint of the little fruit himſelf had, and that the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould have in preaching of the Goſpel, regrating and complaining of it to God as a ſore matter, that it ſhould come to ſo many, and ſo few ſhould get good of it, ſo few ſhould be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and to be ſaved by it.</p>
            <p>Though theſe words be few, yet they have four great things in them, to which we ſhall reduce them, for ſpeaking more clearly to them. 1. That the great ſubject of Preaching, and Preachers great errand is, to report concerning Jeſus Chriſt, to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152256:24"/> bring tydings concerning Him. 2. That the great duty of Hearers (implyed) is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Report, and by vertue of it, to be brought to reſt and rely on Jeſus Chriſt. 3. That the great, though the ordinary ſin of the generality of the Hearers of the Goſpel, is unbelief, <hi>Who hath believed?</hi> that is, it's few that have believed; it's a rare thing to ſee a Believer of this Report. 4. That the great complaint, weight, and grief of an honeſt Miniſter of the Goſpel, is this, that his Meſſage is not taken off his hand, that Chriſt is not received, believed in, and reſted on; this is the great challenge Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have againſt the generality of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the ground of their complaint to God, that whatever they report concerning Chriſt, He is not welcomed, His Kingdom thrives not.</p>
            <p>That we may ſpeak to the firſt, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words with reſpect to the Scope, we ſhall draw five or ſix <hi>Doctrines</hi> from them: The firſt whereof is more general, that the diſcovery of Chriſt Jeſus, and the making him known, is the greateſt News, the gladeſt Tydings, and the moſt excellent Report, that ever came, or can come to a People, there is no ſuch thing can be told them, no ſuch Tydings can they hear; this is the Report that the Prophet ſpeaks of by way of eminency, a Report above, and beyond all other Reports; theſe are News worthy to be carried by Angels, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi> ſaith one of them, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.20. <hi>I bring you good tydings of great joy; which ſhall be to all people:</hi> And what are theſe Tydings ſo prefaced to with a <hi>Behold? for unto you is born this day, in the city of</hi> David, <hi>a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord:</hi> theſe are the good Tydings, that Jeſus Chriſt is come, and that he is the Saviour by Office. We ſhall not inſiſt on this, onely 1. We will find a little view of this Subject in the following words, which hold forth clearly Chriſt, God and Man in one Perſon, ſo compleatly qualified, and excellently furniſhed for His Offices. 2. It's alſo clear, if we look to the excellent effects that come by His being ſo furniſhed, as His ſatisfying of Juſtice, His ſetting free of Captives, His triumphing over Principalities and Powers, His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the works of the Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there cannot be more excellent works or effects ſpoken of. 3. It's clear, if we look to Him from whom this Report cometh, and in whoſe Breaſt theſe News bred, (if we may ſpeak ſo) they are the reſult of the Counſel of the God-head; and therefore, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port here is made in the Lord's Name, ſo He is complained to, when it is not taken off the Prophet's hand. And 4. it's clear, if we look to the myſteriouſneſs of theſe News, Angels could never have conceived them, had not this Report come; theſe things tell that they are great, glorious, and good News, glad Tydings, as it is in the end of the former Chapter, <hi>That which hath not been told them ſhall they ſee, and that which they have not heard ſhall they conſider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Uſe</hi> is, To draw our hearts to be in love with the Goſpel, and to waken our eſtimation of it: Peoples ears are itching after Novelties, and ye are much worn out of conceit with theſe News; but is there in any News ſuch an advantage as in theſe, when God ſendeth News to Men, they muſt be great News, and ſuch indeed are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Therefore be affrayed to entertain loathing of the plain ſubſtantial Truths of the Goſpel; if ye had never heard them before, there would, belike, be ſome <hi>Athenian</hi> itching to hear and ſpeak of them, but they ſhould not be the leſs thought of, that they are often heard and ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Therefore think more of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſeeing it containeth the ſubſtance of theſe good News, and glad Tydings, and think more of Goſpel-ordinances whereby theſe good Tydings are ſo often publiſhed and made plain to you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More particularly, <hi>Obſerve,</hi> that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and what concerneth Him, the glad and good News of a Saviour, and the reporting of them, is the very proper work of a Miniſter, and the great ſubject of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters preaching; his proper work is to make Him known, or take it thus, Chriſt is the native ſubject on which all preaching ſhould run; this is the Report the Prophet ſpeaketh of here, and in effect, it was ſo to <hi>John</hi> and the other Apoſtles, and ſhould be ſo to all Miniſters; Chriſt Jeſus and what concerns Him, in His Perſon, Natures and Offices; to know, and make Him known
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152256:25"/> to be God and Man; to make Him known in His Offices, to be Prieſt, Prophet, and King; to be a Prieſt, in His ſuffering and ſatisfying Juſtice; to be a Prophet, in revealing the Will of God; to be a King, for ſubduing folks Luſts and Corruptions; and to know, and make Him known, in the way by which Sinners, both Preachers and Hearers, may come to have Him to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as follows in this Chapter. This, this is the ſubject of all Preaching, and all Preaching ſhould be levelled at this mark; <hi>Paul</hi> is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. peremptory in this, <hi>I determined to know nothing among you, but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified,</hi> as if he had ſaid, I will meddle with no other thing, but betake my ſelf to this; not onely will he forbear to meddle with civil Employments, but he will lay aſide his Learning, Eloquence, and Humane Wiſdom, and make the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Chriſt crucified his great work and ſtudy, the reaſon of this is, becauſe Chriſt ſtandeth in a fourfold relation to preaching. 1. He is the <hi>Text,</hi> to ſay ſo, of Preaching; all Preaching is to explain Him, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſs,</hi> and ſo do the four Evangels, and the Apoſtolick Epiſtles, which are as ſo many Preachings of Him; and that Preaching which ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in relation to Him, is beſide the Text and Mark. 2. He is holden out as the <hi>Foundation</hi> and Ground-work of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that Preaching without Him wants Foundation, and is the Building, as it were, of a Caſtle in the Air, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10— <hi>I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon, but let every man take heed how he buildeth, for other foundation can no man lay then that which is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> importing that all Preaching ſhould be ſquared to, and made to agree with this Ground-ſtone. 3. He ſtandeth as the great <hi>End</hi> of Preaching, not onely that Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may have Him known in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but may have Him high in their Hearts and Affections, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4. <hi>We preach not our ſelves,</hi> that is, not onely do we not preach our ſelves as the Subject, but we preach not our ſelves as the end of our Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our ſcope is not to be great, or much thought of, but our end in Preaching is to make Chriſt great. 4. He ſtandeth in relation to Preaching, as He is the <hi>Power and Life</hi> of Preaching, without whom, no Preaching can be effectual, no Soul can be captivate and brought in to Him; hence 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. he ſayeth, <hi>We preach Christ crucified, to the</hi> Jews <hi>a ſtumbling block,</hi> they cannot abide to hear him, <hi>and to the</hi> Greeks <hi>fooliſhneſs, but to them that are ſaved, the power of God, and the wiſdom of God.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. For Miniſters, which we ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear inſiſting on; onely 1. Were Chriſt the ſubject and ſubſtance of our Report, were we more in holding out Him, it's like it might go better with us. 2. There is need of warrineſs, that the Report we make, ſuit well the Foundation: And 3. the neglect of this may be the cauſe of much powerleſs Preaching, becauſe Chriſt is not ſo preached as the ſubject-matter and end of Preaching, many Truths are (alace) ſpoken without reſpect to this end, or but with little reſpect to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſes</hi> particular for you that are Hearers, are theſe. 1: If this be the great ſubject of Miniſters Preaching, and that which ye ſhould hear moſt gladly, and if this be moſt profitable for you, we may be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in ſome few Directions to you, which will be as ſo many branches of the Uſe. And firſt, of all Truths that People would wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and ſtudy, they would welcome and ſtudy theſe that concern Chriſt and the Covenant of Grace moſt, as Foundation-truths, and ſeek to have them backed by the Spirit; we are affrayed there is a fault among Chriſtians, that moſt plain and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Truths are not ſo heeded, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things that may further folk in their Light, or tickle their Affections, or anſwer a Caſe, are almoſt only ſought after; which things (it's true) are good, but if the plain and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Truths of the Goſpel were more ſtudied, and made uſe of, they have in them that which would anſwer all Caſes: It's a ſore matter when folks are more taken up with Notions and Speculations, then with theſe Soul-ſaving Truths, as, that Chriſt was born, that he was a true Man, that he was, and is King, Prieſt, and Prophet of His Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that other things are heard with more greedineſs: But, if theſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152256:25"/> be the great ſubject of Miniſters Preaching, it ſhould be your great ſtudy to know Chriſt, in His Perſon, Natures, Offices, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, what He is to you, and what is your duty to Him, and how you ſhould walk in Him and with Him; this was <hi>Paul</hi>'s aim, <hi>I count</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all things loſs and dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt, that I may know him and the power of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10. It's my deſign, (as if he had ſaid) not onely to make Him known, but to know Him my ſelf; there is little Faith in Chriſt, and diſtinctneſs in uſe mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of His Offices, and folks take but little pains to know theſe things: Therefore, on the one ſide, let me exhort you, to make this more the ſubject of your enquiry; and on the other ſide, take it for your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, that there is ſuch a readineſs to ſnuff when plain Truths are inſiſted on, or when they are not followed in ſome uncouth or ſtrange way, which ſayes we are exceeding unthankful to God for giving us the beſt things to ſpeak, hear, and think of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Think much of the Preaching of Chriſt, and to have Miniſters to preach of Him, He is the beſt News, and God hath ſent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters on this errand to make them known to you; had He ſent them to tell you all the ſecret things to come that are in God's purpoſe, and all the hid works of Nature, it had not been compareable to theſe News; what would ye have been? O what would Sabbath-days, and Week-days, your lying down and riſing up, your living and dying been, if theſe News had not been? ye ſhould have had a ſinful and ſad life, and a moſt comfortleſs and terrible death; therefore think this Goſpel a thing of more worth then ye do, and count their feet beautiful on the Mountains, that bring theſe News and glad Tydings, as it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. that good Report of making Peace betwixt God and Sinners ſhould be moſt thought of and prized, and counted a greater favour then we uſe to count it. 3. By this ye may know who thrives and profites beſt under the Goſpel, even theſe that learn moſt of Chriſt, which conſiſts not in telling over words. But firſt in actual improving of Him, as it is <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Ye have not ſo learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt,</hi> but ſo as to improve what is in Him. 2. In an experimental finding of theſe effects in us, that are ſpoken of to come by Chriſt, which is, that the Apoſtle mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. <hi>That I may know him and the power of his reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, that I may be conformable to his death;</hi> I am affrayed that of the many that hear this Goſpel, there are but few that know Chriſt this way: But if He be the great thing that ſhould he preached by us, and that ye ſhould learn, 1. What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſo many ſhould be ignorant of Him, that the moſt part look rather like <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> then like <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> God help us, what ſhall we ſay of the condition of the moſt part of People, when the preaching of the Goſpel has not gained this much ground on us, as to make us know Chriſt, in His Perſon, Natures, Offices, our need of Him, and the uſe we ſhould make of Him? But 2. If we will try how he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven, it is to be feared, there be far fewer that know h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m in this reſpect; do not many Men live as if they had never heard tell of Him? Though they hear that pardon of Sin is to be gotten through Him, and that vertue to ſubdue Sin muſt flow from Him, yet they live as if no ſuch thing were in Him: If your Conſciences were poſed, beſides the evidences that are in your practice, this would be found to be a ſad truth. And 3. If we will yet try further, what experience folk have of Chriſt, what vertue they find flowing from His Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, what fellowſhip there is in His Sufferings, what conformity to His Death, what benefite red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They know Him not that feel not ſomething of the efficacy of His Death and Reſurrection in themſelves.</p>

               </gap>rand that has been, and is, and will be common to all the Miniſters of the Goſpel to the end of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152256:26"/> the World; It's <hi>our Report,</hi> it was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of all the Prophets, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. <hi>To him bear all the Prophets witneſs, that through his Name, whoſoever believeth on him, ſhould have remiſſion of ſins;</hi> they all agree, and have a joint Teſtimony in theſe. 1. In one Subject, Chriſt, and the ſame things concerning Him, as, that the pardon of Sin is to be gotten in Him, and through Faith in Him, and no other way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. In one Commiſſion; they have all one Commiſſion though they be not all equal; all are not Apoſtles, yet all are Ambaſſadours, there is the ſame Authority for us to report and you to receive the Goſpel, as if <hi>Iſaiah</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> were preaching; the Authority depending on the Commiſſion, and not on the perſons of Men who carry it. 3. In one common End which they all have, and in one common Object they are ſent to. 4. In this, that they all hold of one common Maſter, being Gifts of one and the ſame Mediator, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>When he aſcended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men, to ſome Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Uſe</hi> is, To teach you not to think the leſs of the Teſtimony, or matter teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, becauſe of theſe that teſtifie to you; if <hi>Iſaiah</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> were teſtifying to you, ye would get no other Tydings, though their life and way would be of another ſort and ſtamp then ours are alace! for the moſt part, we are warranded as well as they to make Chriſt known to you; therefore take heed of rejecting this Teſtimony of this Chriſt that we bear witneſs unto; it is the ſame Chriſt that the Law and the Prophets bear witneſs to, <hi>There is not another name given under heaven whereby a ſinner can be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> it's through Him, that whoſoever be- on Him may receive remiſſion of ſins; in this ye have not onely us, but the Prophets and Apoſtles to deall with, yea Jeſus Chriſt, and God Himſelf; and the rejecting of us, will be found to be the rejecting of them; it's the ſame Teſtimony on the matter that it was in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> his time; and therefore, tremble and fear, all ye that ſlight the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, ye have not us for your Party, but all the Prophets, and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> among the reſt, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath ſaid, <hi>He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me;</hi> there will be many aggravations of the guilt of an Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and this will be a main one, even the Teſtimony of all the Prophets that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in this Truth which they have reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; take heed to this all ye Atheiſts that know not what it is to take with Sin, and all ye Hypocrites that coin and counterfeit a Religion of your own, and all ye legal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that lean to your own righteouſneſs; what will ye ſay when it ſhall be found that ye have rejected all theſe Teſtimonies? ye muſt either ſay, ye counted them falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which ye will not dare to ſay, or that ye accounted them true, and yet would not receive their Teſtimony, and the beſt of theſe will be found ſad enough; for if ye counted them true, why did ye not believe them? this will be a very pungent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma.</p>

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. For comfort to poor Believers, they have good ground to receive and reſt upon Jeſus Chriſt, there is never a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Apoſtle, or Preacher of the Goſpel but he hath ſealed this Truth concerning Chriſt; what needs any ſinner ſcar at Him or be fearful to cloſe with Him? will ye give credit to the Teſtimony of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and of <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 10.43. and of the reſt of the Prophets and Apoſtles? then receive their Report, and ſet your ſelves to be among the number of Believers, that their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony may be reſted on: We are perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there is one of two that will follow on this Doctrine, either a ſtrong encouragement to, and confirmation of believing, and quietly reſting on Jeſus Chriſt for pardon of ſin, or a great ground of aggravation of, and expoſtulation with you for your guilt, who care not whether ye receive this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or not.

            <p>THE Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> is very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous about the fruit of his Preaching, when he hath prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched concerning Chriſt; as indeed it is not enough for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to preach, and for People to hear, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome fruit follow; and now when he hath been much in Preaching, and looketh to others that have been much in that work, he ſadly regrates the little fruit it had, and would have among them, to whom Chriſt was, and ſhould be ſpoken of; a thing, that in the entry ſhould put us to be ſerious, leſt this complaint of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſtand on record a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; ſeeing he complains of the Hearers of the Goſpel, not only in his own time, but in our time alſo.</p>
            <p>We told you, there were four things in this firſt part of the Verſe. 1. The great errand that Miniſters have to a People, it is to report concerning Chriſt; and beſide what we obſerved from this Head before, looking to the Scope, we ſhall obſerve fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The end that Miniſters ſhould have before them in preaching Chriſt and the Goſpel, is, That the Hearers of it may be gained to Jeſus Chriſt by hearing, ſo as they may be brought to believe on Him; it's in a word, to gain them to ſaving Faith in Chriſt:</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is implyed, That Jeſus Chriſt is only to be propoſed as the Object of Faith, to be reſted on by the Hearers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and as the only ground of their Peace; there is no name that can be mentioned for the ſalvation of Souls, but this Name only; ly; and there is no other Goſpel can be propoſed but that which holdeth Him out to People.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Obſerve, (which is much the ſame with the former Obſervation, and to which we would ſpeak a little more particularly,) That by the preaching of the Goſpel, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is laid before the Hearers of it, as the Object of their Faith, and propoſed to be believed upon by them, elſe there would be no ground of this complaint againſt them; but where-ever this Goſpel is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, there is Chriſt is laid, as it were, at the foot or door of every Soul that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, to be believed and reſted on; this is the great errand of the Goſpel, to propoſe to People Jeſus Chriſt, as the Object and Ground of Faith, to lay Him down to be reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on for that very end; when the Apoſtle is ſpeaking <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. of the Doctrine of Faith, he ſaith, <hi>It is not now who ſhall aſcend into heaven, nor who ſhall deſcend into the deep, but the word is near thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart;</hi> what word is that? <hi>the word of faith which we preach;</hi> now ſayeth he, Chriſt by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel is brought ſo near folks, that He is brought even to their Hearts, and to their Mouths, ſo near, that (to ſpeak ſo) People have no more to do but to ſtoup and take Him up, or to roll themſelves over upon Him; yea, it bringeth Him in to their very Heart, that they have no more to do but to bring up their Heart to conſent to cloſe the Bargain, and with the Mouth to make confeſſion of it; and theſe words are the more conſiderable, that they are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152256:27"/> borrowed from <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. where <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſetting Death and Life before the People, and bidding them chooſe, though he would ſeem to ſpeak of the Law, yet if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſcope, we will find him to be on the matter ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt, holden forth to that People under Ceremonial-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and ſhewing them that there was Life to be had in Him that way, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods intent, they had Life and Death put in their choice.</p>
            <p>I know there are two things neceſſary to the acting and exerciſing of Faith, The 1. is objective, when the Object or Ground is propoſed in the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. The 2. is ſubjective, when there is an inward, ſpiritual, and powerful quickning, and framing of the Heart, to lay hold on, and make uſe of the Object and offer; it is true, that all to whom the offer cometh are not quickened, but the Doctrine ſaith, that, to all to whom the Goſpel cometh, Chriſt is propoſed, to be believed on by them, and brought near unto them; ſo that we may ſay as Chriſt ſaid to His Hearers, <hi>The kingdom of God is come near unto you;</hi> both <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>John</hi> brought, and laid the Kingdom of Heaven near to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and it is laid as near to you in the preached Goſpel: This is it then that Doctrine ſayes, 1. That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel holdeth out Chriſt as a ſufficient ground of Faith to reſt upon. And 2. with a ſufficient warrand to theſe who hear it, to make uſe of Him, according to the terms on which he is offered. And 3. it brings Him ſo preſſingly home, as He is laid to the Doors and Hearts of Sinners who hear the Goſpel; that whoever hath the offer, he muſt neceſſarily, either believe in, and receive Chriſt, or reject Him, and caſt at the report made of Him in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt a little confirm this Doctrine, and then ſecondly make uſe of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall confirm it from theſe Grounds, 1. From the plain offers which the Lord maketh in His Word, and from the warrand he giveth His Miniſters to make the ſame offers; It's their Commiſſion to pray them to whom they are ſent to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, to tell them, <hi>that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf,</hi> as it is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20. and in Chriſt's ſteed to requeſt them to embrace the offer of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; to tell them that Chriſt died for the Sinners that will embrace Him, and that He will impute His Righteouſneſs unto them; and <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.1. <hi>We beſeech you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ye receive not this grace in vain;</hi> which is not meant of ſaving Grace, but of the gracious offer of Grace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation through Him; This is Miniſters work, to pray People not to be idle Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this Goſpel, <hi>for,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in a day of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have I ſuccoured thee; behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> The force of the Argument is this, if ye will make this Goſpel welcome, ye may get a Hearing, for now is the day of Salvation, therefore do not neglect it; So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.10, 11. (where God maketh the offer of Himſelf, and that very largely,) <hi>Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it;</hi> The Offer is of Himſelf, as the words following clear, <hi>My people would not hearken to my voice, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me;</hi> for they that refuſe His Word, refuſe Himſelf; and hence, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1. he ſaith, <hi>I am found of them that ſought me not, I ſaid, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name,</hi> and to the <hi>Jews, I have ſtretched out my hands all day long to a rebellious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> 2. We may clear and confirm it from theſe ſimilitudes, by which the Offer of this Goſpel is, as it were, brought to the doors of People, and there are ſeveral ſimilitudes made uſe of to this purpoſe; I ſhall name but four. 1. It's ſet down under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of wooing, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>I have eſpouſed you as a chaſt virgin to Chriſt,</hi> this is ordinary, and ſuppoſeth a Marriage, and a Bridegroom, that is by his friends wooing and ſuting in Marriage; ſo that (as we ſhew) wherever the call of the Goſpel comes, it's a beſpeaking of Souls to Him, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. <hi>What ſhall we do for our ſiſter in the day that ſhe ſhall be ſpoken for?</hi> 2. It's ſet out under the expreſſion of inviting to a Feaſt, and Hearers of the Goſpel are called to come to Chriſt as Strangers, or Gueſts are called to come to a Wedding-feaſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.2, 3, 4. <hi>All things are ready, come to the wedding,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the Goſpel calleth not to an empty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152256:27"/> Houſe that wants meat, but to a Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe where Chriſt is made ready as the Cheer, and there wants no more but feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Him: So it's ſet out under the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of Eating and Drinking, <hi>John</hi> 6.57. <hi>He that eats me, even he ſhall live by me.</hi> 3. It's ſet out often under the expreſſion or ſimilitude of a Market, where all the Wares are laid forth on the Stands, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho every one that thirsts come to the waters,</hi> &amp;c. and leaſt it ſhould be ſaid, or thought, that the Proclamation is only to the thirſty, and to ſuch as are ſo and ſo qualified; ye may look to what followeth, <hi>let him that hath no mony come, yea, come buy without mony and without price;</hi> and to the offer that is made to thoſe of <hi>Laodicea, Rev.</hi> 3. who in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, were a hypocritical and formal Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet to them the Counſel and Call comes forth, <hi>Come buy of me eye-ſalve, and gold tryed in the fire,</hi> &amp;c. It ſayes, the Wares are even in their offer, or even offered to them. 4. It's ſet out under the ſimilitude of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and knocking at a Door, becauſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel brings Chriſt a knocking and calling hard at Sinners doors, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if any man will hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him and ſup with him, and he with me;</hi> So <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. By the ſleepy Bride it is ſaid, <hi>It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. laſt four Verſes, it's cryed, <hi>Lift up your heads ye gates, and be lift up ye everlaſting doors, that the king of glory may come in,</hi> which is an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>arneſt invitation to make way for Chriſt Jeſus, wanting nothing but an entry into the heart; whereby we may ſee, how near Chriſt comes in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and is laid to folks hand. 3. We may confirm it from the nature of Faith, and of the obedience that is required to be given to the command of Believing; Wherever this Goſpel comes, it tyeth and obligeth all the Hearers to believe on Chriſt, that is, to receive and welcome Him; and there could be no receiving of Him, if He were not making an offer of Himſelf; thus it's ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.11.12. <hi>He came unto his own, but his own received him not, but to as many as received him, to them gave he power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſons of God;</hi> He came to both theſe who received Him, and to theſe who receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Him not; but He gave to Believers only, this priviledge of Son-ſhip: If we look to all the names of Faith, as <hi>coming to Chriſt, eating and drinking of Him, receiving of Him, reſting on Him,</hi> &amp;c. They all ſuppoſe that Chriſt is near to be catched hold of, and within ſpeaking and tryſting terms to Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that hear the Goſpel. 4. It may be confirmed from the many ſad complaints that the Lord hath for not receiving Him, and not believing His Word, and from the dreadful deſignations by which He holds out the ſin of Unbelief; all which, will make out this, that God lays Chriſt at Sinners door in His Word; Hence <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. our Lord ſays, <hi>Ye will not come unto me, that ye may get life:</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. at the cloſe, <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, how often would I have gathered thee, and ye would not;</hi> This was it that did aggravate their ſin, that He would, and they would not; So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. <hi>My people would not hearken to my voice, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me;</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 7. it's ſaid, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and the <hi>Phariſees rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves;</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 13.45. when the <hi>Jews</hi> rejected Chriſt, it's ſaid, <hi>they judged themſelves unworthy of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life;</hi> and therefore the Apoſtles ſay, that they will <hi>leave them and turn to the</hi> Gentiles. 5. We may confirm it from this, That in reſpect of the Goſpel, and Offer made in it, Chriſt comes alike ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r to all that hear it; for if He be near to ſome, then He is near to all, I mean in regard of an objective nearneſs; there is the ſame war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to ſpeak and make the offer to all, before there be ſome diſcovery made for qualifying the Doctrine to ſome; I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>'s true, there is a difference in reſpect of the power that accompanieth the Goſpel, but as it lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out the offer of Chriſt, and Life through Him, it comes alike near to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll the Hearers of it; the Invitation comes to all, and in the ſame terms, to them that refuſe, as well as to them that receive Him, the ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is preached to both. A 6th. Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is from the nature of God's adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of His external Covenant, which is ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Baptiſm to both, not one Covenant to one, and another Covenant to another, but the ſame Covenant on condition of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to both: Behold then, in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152256:28"/> of this Goſpel, that Chriſt comes near you, even to your door, in reſpect of the mediate Ordinances, as near as He did to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> Although God had His extraordinary ways of manifeſting Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them, not common to others; yea, this day, the Goſpel is more clear objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to you then it was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced to ſee Chriſt's day afar off, when it was vailed; yea, the Goſpel is as clearly preached to you, as thoſe who are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne of God, had it preached to them, as to the matter of it, though we will make no equality as to the manner of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Advert to this, when ye come to hear the Goſpel preached, and think how ye are living in tryſting terms with God, and how near Chriſt comes unto you; the word of Faith lays Him ſo near, that ye have no more to do but to receive the offer of Him, to believe and cloſe with Him, and ſtep in upon Him, as it were, to come as living Stones to be built upon Him as a ſure Foundation.</p>
            <p>But it will be aſked, How comes this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſo near? How does it bring Chriſt ſo near to Sinners? <hi>Anſw.</hi> In theſe five ſteps, 1. As it makes the Report of Chriſt, and brings the Tydings of ſuch things, as that He is Born, and that He hath Suffered, and for ſuch an End, and that we may partake of the Benefite of them on ſuch terms; It makes the Proclamation narratively, and tells what He did, what Good may be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of Him, and how we may come by it. 2. As it brings an offer of theſe good things on the terms on which they are to be gotten, ſo that it never tells that Chriſt is come, but it ſays alſo, here is Life to be gotten in Him by you, if ye will take the way propoſed to come by it; therefore, when the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation comes forth, <hi>that all things are ready,</hi> the next word is, <hi>Come to the Wedding;</hi> And when in the one word He ſays, <hi>I ſtand at the door and knock,</hi> at the next He ſays, <hi>If any man will open the door, I will come in to him, and ſup with him and he with me;</hi> and when <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. it's ſaid, <hi>He is a precious corner-ſtone, a tryed foundation-ſtone laid in</hi> Zion, the next word is, <hi>He that believes on him ſhall not make haste,</hi> or as the Apoſtle hath it, <hi>ſhall not be aſhamed or confounded;</hi> this makes the Goſpel glad Tydings, becauſe it comes alwayes with an offer of Chriſt and of Life in Him. 3. When the Offer is made, and the precious Wares are expoſed to ſale in this cryed Fair of Grace, a command comes out, chooſe Life, come buy the Wares, believe, receive the Offer, as is clear in all the places we named before; It leaves not Folks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to receive or nor, but chargeth them as they would be obedient to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to receive Him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is his commandment, that ye ſhould believe on the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> This is the great Goſpel-command, and Miniſters have not only the telling of theſe News, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to make the Offer, but a Commiſſion to command to receive it, and therefore the ſitting and ſlighting of the Offer, is a Sin oppoſite to the Command. 4. It not only makes the Offer, and backs the Offer with a Command to embrace it, but it ſweetens the Command with many gracious Promiſes knit to it, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. <hi>Hear and your ſoul ſhall live, and I will make an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant with you, even the ſure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of</hi> David; And whenever the Command of Believing comes out, it's always with a Promiſe; as <hi>Paul</hi> deals with the Jaylor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. <hi>Believe and thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> 16. towards the cloſe, the Lord ſays, <hi>They that believe ſhall be ſaved,</hi> to encourage to Faith in Him. 5. It preſſes the Offer, and commands embracing of it with the Promiſe, with a certification; for the Offer is not conditional, but alternative, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. <hi>If ye believe not, ye ſhal be damned;</hi> ſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. Death and Life are propoſed, and they are bidden chooſe: If the Goſpel be not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual in it's Commands and Promiſes, it will be effectual in its Threatnings; The Word of God will triumph one way or the other, and not return to Him void, as is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clear, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.11. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15, 16. It triumphs in ſome, while they are brought by the Promiſe to give obedience to the command of Believing, and to them it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the ſavour of life unto life; and to others it triumphs as to the execution of the Threatning on them for their Unbelief, and to them it becomes the ſavour of death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death: In a word, Chriſt Jeſus comes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152256:28"/> ſo near People in this Goſpel, that He muſt either be choſen and Life with Him, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, to the deſtruction and death of the Refuſer; ye have the ſame Chriſt, the ſame Word, the ſame Covenant, the ſame obligation to Believe, propoſed to you, that Believers from the beginning of the World had, and another ye will not get, and what more can the Goſpel do to bring Chriſt near to you? when it brings Him ſo near, that ye have Him in your offer, and the Authority of God and His Promiſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed, to perſwade you to accept of the Offer; and Threatnings added, to certifie you, that if ye accept it not, ye ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; in which reſpect, we may ſay as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doeth, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. <hi>What could God do more to his vineyard which he hath not done?</hi> as to the holding out of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith, Jeſus Chriſt to be reſted on by you.</p>

               </gap>art of unbelief in you, that ye will not believe in Chriſt, nor open to Him when He is brought to your Door; I doubt, yea, I put it out of doubt, when all that ever heard the Goſpel ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll ſtand before the Throne, that there ſhall be one found that ſhall dare to make this excuſe, that they were not able to receive Chriſt; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel brings Chriſt ſo near them, that they muſt either ſay yea or nay, it is not ſo much, I cannot, as, I will not believe, and that will be found a wilful and malicious refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may be objected, But how can this Goſpel come to all alike, ſeing it cannot be, that theſe that will never get good of the Goſpel, hath it as near to them, as theſe that get the ſaving Fruit of it? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not to ſpeak of God's Purpoſe, or what He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make of it, not of the Power and Fruit that accompanies it to ſome, and not to all; it's certain, the Goſpel and Chriſt in its Offer, comes alike near to all that hear it: It objectively reveals the ſame glad Tydings to all, with the conditional offer of Life, and with the ſame command and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and certification in Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings as well as Promiſes; In theſe reſpects Chriſt is brought alike near to all, and when God cometh to reckon, He will let Sinners know in that day, that the Goſpel came to their Door, and was refuſed; yea, it comes, and where it comes, will take hold of ſome to pluck them out of the Snare, and be ground of Faith to them, and to others it will be a ground of Challenge, and ſo the ſavour of death unto death; for though it take not effect as to its Promiſes in all, nor in its Threatnings to all, yet as to either Death or Life, it wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But it may be aſked, Why will God have Chriſt in the Offer of the Goſpel brought ſo near the Hearers of it? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſerves to commend the Grace and Love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation is ſo broad, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is to all; it ſpeaks out the royalty of the Feaſt, upon which ground 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. it's called <hi>Grace,</hi> the Offer is ſo large and wide. 2. Becauſe it ſerves for warranding and confirming the Elect in the receiving of this Offer, for none of the Elect could receive Him if He were not even laid to their Door; It's this which gives us warrand to receive that which God offers; it's not becauſe we are elected or beloved of God before time, or becauſe He purpoſed to do us Good, that we believe, theſe are not grounds of Faith, being God's ſecret Will; but we believe, becauſe God calleth and maketh the Offer, inviteth and promiſeth, knowing that He is faithful, and we may truſt Him; Hence <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>I will never forget thy Word,</hi> and, <hi>in God will I praiſe his Word;</hi> for the Word in its Offer ſpeaks alike to all, and to none parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly: Indeed when it comes to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Promiſes for Conſolation, that is to be made according to the qualifications in the Perſons, but the Offer is to all. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by this means the Lord hath the fairer acceſs to found His Quarrel and Contraverſie againſt Unbelievers, and to make their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152256:29"/> Ditty and Doom the clearer in the day of the Lord, when its found that they never received the Offer, <hi>My people would not hearken to my voice, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me, therefore I gave them up to their own hearts luſts, and they walked in their own counſels;</hi> and this is an approbation given to Juſtice here, it's well-wair'd ſeeing they would not receive Thee, that they get worſe in Thy room.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Seing Chriſt comes near you in this Goſpel, and this is one of the Mercat days, I intreat you, while He is near, receive Him, call upon Him while He is near; or take it in the plain words of the Apoſtle, open to Him, take Him in, give Him welcome while He bodes Himſelf, to ſay ſo, on you; there is not a Conſcience in any Man that hears this Goſpel, but he will have this teſtimony from Him in it, that He came near them, was in their ſight, and within their reach and grips, as it were, if they would have put out their hand to receive Him, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſo, O receive this Goſpel, give Him room; while He is content to ſup with you, take Him in, make ſure your union with Him; this is the end why this Report is made, and Chriſt is laid before you, even that ye may lay your ſelves over on Him.</p>
            <p>I would follow this <hi>Uſe</hi> a little, by way of Exhortation and Expoſtulation jointly, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine will bear both, for when Chriſt is brought ſo near even to the Mouth and to the Heart, it will be great ground of reproof and expoſtulation if He ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. Be exhorted therefore to be in earneſt, ſeing 1. It is a matter of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to you; many Nations, Kings and Kingdoms have not had Chriſt ſo near them as ye have, neglect not ſuch an opportunity; do ye think that all that is ſaid in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel concerning this, is for nought? Is it for no uſe that ſuch a Report is made, and Preaching continued ſo long among you? And if it be for any uſe, is it not for this, that ye may receive the Report, and may by doing ſo, get your ſouls for a Prey? To what uſe will Preaching be, if this uſe and end of it be miſſed? Will your hearing the Goſpel make your Peace with God if Chriſt be not received? 2. Conſider the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ye may have by receiving the Goſpel that others have not, is it a little thing to be called to God's Feaſt, to be married to Chriſt, to be made Friends with God, and to enjoy Him for ever? the Day comes when it will be thought an Advantage, and are there Motives to perſwade to any thing, like thoſe that are to induce to that? 3. Conſider what it is that we require of you, it's no ſtrange nor hard thing, it's but Believing, and this is nothing elſe, but that the Report concerning Chriſt be received, yea, that He be received for your own good; that is it that the Goſpel calls you to, even to betake you to a Phyſician for Cure, to betake you to a Cautioner for your Debt; if ye could eſcape a Reckoning and Wrath another way, it were ſomething, but when there is no other way to obtain pardon of Sin and Peace, or to eſcape Wrath and obtain favour and friendſhip with God, but this, and when this way (to ſpeak ſo) is made ſo eaſie, that its but to ſtoop down, and to take up Chriſt at your foot, as it were, or to roll your ſelves on Him, how inexcuſable will ye Unbelievers be, when ye ſhall be arraigned before His Tribunal? But 4. look a little farther to what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; If ye were to live always here, it were hard enough to live at feed with God; but have ye faith of a Judgement after Death? if ſo, how will ye hold up your Faces in that Day that now refuſe Chriſt? will not horrible confuſion be the portion of many then, and will any ground of confuſion be like this, the ſlighting of Chriſt? when He ſhall be ſeen coming to judge Slighters of Him, what horrour will then riſe in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences when He ſhall appear and be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on them that were not obedient to this Goſpel? as is moſt clear, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>When our Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed in flaming fire, with his mighty Angels from Heaven, to take vengeance on all that know not God and obey not the Goſpel.</hi> 5. Conſider, that Death and Life are now in your option, in your hand as it were, chooſe or refuſe; I ſpeak not, nor plead here for Free-will, but of your willing electing of that which ye have offered to you; for one of two will be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall ye willingly chooſe Life, which is a fruit of Grace, or refuſe Life, and chooſe Death, which will be found the native fruit
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152256:29"/> of your Corruption; ye may have Life by receiving Chriſt who is laid to your Door, and if ye refuſe Him; Death will follow it; as now in Hearing this Goſpel ye carry in chooſing or refuſing, ſo will the Sentence paſs on you at the great Day, and ſo your Sentence, in a manner, is written down with your own hand, as it's ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46. <hi>Ye judge your ſelves unworthy of eternal life,</hi> not out of humility, but maliciouſly: Now when the matter is of ſuch concernment, beware of playing the fool; if ye will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue preſumptuous and ſecure, following your Idols, what will the Lord ſay, but let it be ſo, ye get no wrong when ye get your own choice, and He, but as it were, ratifies the Sentence which ye have paſt on your ſelves. 6. I ſhall add but this one word more, and beſeech you that ye would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly lay this to Heart, as a weighty thing, conſidering the Certification that follows on it; It's not only Death, but a horrible Death, Wrath, and Wrath with its aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this Ground; like that of <hi>Capernaum</hi> that was lifted up to Heaven in this reſpect, having Chriſt brought ſo near them; to whom this Goſpel is not the ſavour of Life unto Life, it ſhall be the ſavour of Death unto Death, and think not this a common Motive, though it be commonly uſed, it will bring Wrath upon Wrath, and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon Vengeance on the Hearers of this Goſpel, beyond that of <hi>Sodom,</hi> if ye be ſtill Rejecters of it; ſure, none of you would think it an eaſie thing to be puniſhed as <hi>Sodom</hi> was, nor digeſt well the Curſe that came on them; is there any of you but ye would think it uncouth and ſtrange, yea ſtupendious, to enter into their Judgement, and to have your Lands turned in a ſtinking Loch, and your ſelves eternally tormented with them? but there is more wrath and vengeance following on the ſin of Unbelief, and rejecting of Chriſt when He comes to your Door in this Guſpel. To cloſe up all, Conſider that Chriſt is near you, and hath been long near you, and wooing you, ye know not how many Days or Years ye ſhall have, how ſoon this Goſpel may be taken from you, or ye from it, how ſoon ye may be put in the Pit, where ye will gnaſh your Teeth, gnaw your Tongues, and blaſpheme God; therefore be ſerious while Chriſt is in your offer, and roll your ſelves over up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Him while ye have Him ſo near you, welcome this <hi>Hearing</hi> or <hi>Report</hi> while it ſounds in your Ears, that there may be no juſt ground of this Complaint againſt you, <hi>Lord, who hath believed our report?</hi>

            <p>THe moſt part of Men and Women think not much of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Goſpel, yet if it were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered what is the Lord's end in it, it would be the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhful News that ever People heard, to hear the Report of a Saviour; that is, and ſhould be, great and glad Tydings of great Joy to all Nations; and we ſhould be ſo compoſed to hear ſuch News from God, and concerning His Will and our own well, as to be ſutably affected with them; It's a wonder that God hath ſent ſuch a Report to People, and in it hath laid Chriſt ſo near them, that He puts Him home to them, and lays Him before them, even at their Feet as it were; and as great a wonder, that when the Lord hath condeſcended to give
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152256:30"/> ſuch a Saviour, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ought Him ſo near, that all He calleth for is Faith, to believe the Report, or rather Faith in Him of whom the Report is, which is the ſecond thing in the words.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing then, is, The Duty that lyes on People to whom the Lord ſends the Goſpel, or this Report concerning Chriſt, and ye may take it in this general; That it lyes on all that hear the Goſpel to believe the Report that it brings concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, and by Faith to receive Him who is holden out to them in it; this is clearly implyed, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and all Miniſters are ſent to report concerning Him, and to bear witneſs of Him, and its the duty of all Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to believe it, and this is the ground of his and their complaint when People do not believe it: By comparing this Text with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16. and <hi>John</hi> 12.38. we ſhew that it is ſaving Faith that is here to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take up this Doctrine in three Branches, which we will find in the words, and which will make way for the Uſe. 1. That a People to whom Chriſt is offered in the Goſpel, may warrantably accept of Chriſt, or, the offering of Chriſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is warrand enough to believe on Him; otherwiſe there had been no juſt ground of expoſtulation and complaint for not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for though the complaint will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that they had ability to Believe, yet it will infer they had a warrand to Believe; for the complaint is for the neglect of the Duty they were called to. 2. That they to whom Chriſt is offered in the Goſpel are called to Believe, it's their Duty to do it, thus, Believing, in all that hear this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is neceſſary, by neceſſity of command, even as Holineſs, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are. 3. That ſaving Faith is the way and mean by which theſe that have Chriſt offered to them in the Goſpel, come to get a Right to Him, and to obtain the Benefites that are reported of to be had from Him; thus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is neceſſary as a mids to the end of getting Chriſt, and all that is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Him: This is alſo here implyed in the regrate made of the want of Faith, which prejudgeth Men of Chriſt, and of the Benefites of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
            <p>We ſhall ſhortly put by the firſt of theſe, which is, That all that hear the Goſpel preached, have Warrand to believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt for their eternal Peace, and for making up of the breach betwixt God and them; this preached Goſpel gives you all Warrand to accept of Jeſus Chriſt, and ye would not ſeek after, nor call for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I ſhall firſt premit two diſtinctions to clear this, and then ſecondly confirm it. As for the firſt of the two diſtinctions that ſerve to clear it, We may take up the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel more largely and complexly, in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-form, holding out Chriſt and His Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites on condition of Believing; or we may take it up as it holds out a Promiſe, without particular mentioning of a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Now, when we ſay that the Goſpel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and warrands all that hear it to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Offer, we do not mean the laſt, that all that hear the Goſpel have Warrand to accept the Promiſe without a Condition; but the firſt, that is, that all the Hearers of the Goſpel are commanded to accept of Chriſt offered; there is by the preaching of it, a Warrand to cloſe with the Report, and then to meddle with, and take hold of the Promiſes, and the things promiſed; ſo that it's the Goſpel conditionally propoſed that gives warrand to Believe, as Believing reſts on Chriſt for obtaining Life in Him. The ſecond Diſtinction is, That we would conſider Faith, as it reſts on Chriſt for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Union with Him, and Right to the Promiſes; or, as it applyes and makes uſe of the Benefites to be gotten in and by Chriſt; the Offer of the Goſpel gives not to all a Warrand to apply the Benefites to be gotten by Chriſt inſtantly, but it war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands them to cloſe with Him firſt, and then to apply His Benefites.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For confirmation of this Truth, That the general preaching of the Goſpel is a Warrand for believing and exerciſing Faith on Jeſus Chriſt, for making our Peace with God: It's clear from theſe Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nds. 1. From the nature of the Goſpel, it's the Word of God, as really invitng to do that which it calls for, as if God were ſpeaking from Heaven; it's the Word of God, and not the word of Man, and hath as reall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to call for Obedience, as if God
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152256:30"/> ſpake it immediatly from Heaven; and the Word of Promiſe is as really His Word, as the Word of Command, and therefore to be reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on and improven, as well as we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour obedience to the Command; and if we think that God's Teſtimony is true, and if we lay any juſt weight on theſe three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes teſtifying from Heaven, and on theſe other three teſtifying from Earth, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. then we may reſt on Jeſus Chriſt offered in this Goſpel, and believe, that theſe who reſt on Him ſhall have Life; for it is, as we ſaid, as really God's Word, as if He were ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it audibly from Heaven. 2. It may be confirmed from theſe ſolemn things, the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> of God, whereby He hath mightily confirmed the external Offer of the Goſpel, even the two immutable things wherein it is impoſſible for Him to lie, that theſe who are fled for refuge, to lay hold on the Hope ſet before them, may have ſtrong Conſolation, as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. And God having thus ſaid and ſworn anent this external Covenant, for this very end, that the Hearers of the Goſpel may know, that they who receive Chriſt offered therein, ſhall have Life, it is Warrand ſufficient to believe on Him for Life: It's alſo for this end that He ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h put Seal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the Covenant, Circumciſion and the Paſſover in the Old, and Baptiſm and the Lords Supper in the New Teſtament; which are extended, not only to the Elect, but to Profeſſors in the viſible Church, that every one who is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and admitted to the Communion, may have confirmation of this, that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that God maketh of Life through Chriſt, is a true and real Offer, and will be made good to the Perſons that ſhall receive it, and ſo perform the Condition. 3. It may be confirmed from the End for which God hath appointed the Word and Miniſtry in His Church, even to make the Offer of Chriſt and Life through Him, <hi>John</hi> 20.31. <hi>Theſe things are written, that ye might believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, and that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ye might have life through his Name;</hi> the Word is both written and preached for this very End. 4. And laſtly, It's confirmed from the experience of all the Saints, and from the ground on which they believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which was the ſame that we have; they had no other ground but the ſame Goſpel and Word that we have; it was not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret operation or inſtinct of the Spirit, it's that indeed which works Faith, but it was the Word which was the ground of their Faith, for there is no warrand for Faith but in the Word; and as many Believers as have gone before us, are as ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and experiences to confirm this Truth to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> It ſerves for good uſe to ſuch as may fall to doubt and diſpute what warrand they have to Believe, we ſay, ye have as good warrand as <hi>Abraham, David, Paul,</hi> or any of the Godly that lived before you had; ye have the ſame Goſpel-Covenant and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, it was always God's Word preached which was the ground of Faith; and there needs not be much diſputing what is God's Purpoſe, for we are not called to look to that in the matter of Believing more then in the matter of our Duty; and as it were evil reaſoning to diſpute what may be God's Purpoſe in the matter of Duty when we are called to it, it's as bad reaſoning to diſpute His Purpoſe in the matter of Faith: And therefore we leave this Uſe with a word of Adver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſement, That this Goſpel as it layes Chriſt before you, it gives you Warrand to receive Him, and reſt upon Him, and we may ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39. <hi>Be it known unto you therefore men and brethren, that through this Name is preached unto you forgiveneſs of ſins, and by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes; There is the Way held out for obtaining pardon of Sin, and Peace, the Lord hath made the Offer, and laid a fair Bridge over the Gulf of Diſtance betwixt God and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, though ye ſhould never get good of it, and though ye ſhould never ſet a Foot on the Bridge; none needs to fear to ſtep forward, behold our Lord Jeſus hath hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den out the Golden Scepter, His Call may be Warrand enough to come; the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Goſpel ſtops all Diſputing, and baniſheth debating of the Buſineſs; it Calls all the Hearers of it, and gives them War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to come forward; and it's ſuch a Warrand as they will be found Slighters of the Great Salvation offered, who had this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152256:31"/> Door opened to them and did not ſtep for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for as the Apoſtle ſays, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold now is the day of ſalvation, behold now is the accepted time;</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2. <hi>If the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfast, and every tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and diſobedience received a just recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward, how ſhall we eſcape if we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect ſo great ſalvation? which at the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſpoken by the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. It's the ſame Goſpel that from the beginning hath been preached to Sinners, and this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Goſpel is called <hi>Grace,</hi> in that 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. <hi>We beſeech you that ye receive not this grace of God in vain;</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. at the cioſe, <hi>I do not frustrate the grace of God;</hi> for many get the Warrand and Paſs to come and receive Chriſt, who put it up in their Pocket as it were, and make no uſe of it, as the Man that hid the Talent in his Napkin; the Bonds of Marriage are proclaimed, and the Warrand given forth, and yet they halt and come not to the Wedding.</p>
            <p>We ſhall add the ſecond Branch, which is, That this Goſpel where it comes and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Jeſus Chriſt to Sinners. Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not only warranded to come, but required and commanded to come, the great Duty that the Goſpel calls for is Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; it leaves it not indifferent to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or not, but peremptorily lays it on as a Command; ye hear many Preachings, and Chriſt often ſpoken of, now this is the great thing called for from you, even Believing in Chriſt, and while it is not performed, there is no Obedience given to the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>We ſhall firſt confirm, and then make uſe of this Branch of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For Confirmation, take theſe Grounds, 1. From the manner how the Coſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Faith, it's by way of Command in the Imperative Mood, <hi>Believe, Come ye that are weary,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Come to the Wedding, open,</hi> &amp;c. wherein ſomewhat of the nature of Faith is held out, all theſe being the ſame with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. 2. It's not only commanded as other things are, but peculiarly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and there is a greater weight laid on the obedience of this Command, then on the doing of many other commanded Duties; It's the ſum of all Chriſt's Preaching, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. <hi>Repent and believe the Goſpel;</hi> it's the only command which <hi>Paul</hi> propoſes to the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. 3. It's as it were the peculiar Command that Jeſus Chriſt hath left to His People, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.22. <hi>This is his commandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and this Command of Believing on Him, is the peculiar Command left to, and laid on Miniſters to preſs. 4. It will be clear, if we conſider, that the great Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience that He quarrels for, is, when there is not Believing, when Sinners will not come to Him, this is His Quarrel, <hi>John</hi> 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye may have life,</hi> and here, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>I would have gathered you and ye would not;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 12.37. <hi>Though he did many mighty works among them, yet they believed not on him.</hi> 5 Look to the nature of the Offer made by Chriſt, and to the End of it, and ye will find that the great thing called for, is the receiving of it, which is nothing elſe but Believing; and all our Preachings of Chriſt, and of His Benefites, are uſeleſs without it; without this he wants the ſatisfaction he calls for, for the travel of his Soul; and without it the Hearers of this Goſpel profite not, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Receiving the end of your faith, the ſalvation of your ſouls;</hi> the ſubordinate End of Preaching, to wit, the ſalvation of our Souls, cannot be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without Faith.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> are three. 1. It ſerveth to be a ground for us to propoſe the main Goſpel-Duty to you, and to teach you what is the great and main thing ye are called to; it is even to Believe in Jeſus Chriſt, to exerciſe Faith on Him; it's not only that your Life ſhould be civil, and formal; that ye ſhould Read, Pray, frequent Ordinances, learn the Catechiſm, and ſuch like; but this is it, to Believe on Jeſus Chriſt for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Life, and remiſſion of Sins through Him; and it's not a thing indiff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rent to you, but commanded, and with this certifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if ye Believe not, ye ſhall never get Life nor pardon of Sin; and therefore, as we tell you that remiſſion of Sins is preached to you through Chriſt, ſo we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and charge you to believe on Him, and receive this Goſpel, wherein He is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, for the remiſſion of Sins.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:152256:31"/>
            <p>For clearing of this Uſe, and that we may have the more ready acceſs to Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, We ſhall ſpeak a word to theſe three. Firſt, To ſeveral kinds of true Faith, three whereof are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſaving; or to the ordinary diſtinctions of Faith. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, To the Scripture expreſſions that hold out the nature of ſaving Faith. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To ſome differences betwixt this ſaving Faith, and falſe and counterfite Faith, or theſe acts of true Faith more generally taken, which yet are not ſaving.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, When we ſpeak of Faith, we ſhall draw it to theſe four kinds ordinarily ſpoken of, and ſhall no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> alter nor add to the common diſtinctions of Faith, though there may be moe given. The <hi>firſt</hi> is <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Faith, which may be called true, being it whereby we aſſent to the truth of a thing, becauſe of his ſuppoſed fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity that telleth it; as when an Author writes a Hiſtory, we give it credit upon report that he was an honeſt Man that wrot it: So Hiſtorical Faith is, when People hearing the Word preached or read, they aſſent to the truth of it all; and do not queſtion but that Chriſt came to the World, that He was God and Man in one Perſon, that He died and roſe the third day, and aſcended to Heaven, that they that Believe on Him ſhall be ſaved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and taking the Word to be God's Word, they may give to it a higher aſſent then they give to any Mans word, becauſe God is worthy, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly worthy of more credit than any Man, yea then all Men, and Angels too: There may be, I ſay, in this Hiſtorical Faith of Divine Truths, a higher or greater aſſent then there is in believing of any Humane Hiſtory, which may be the reaſon why many miſtake Hiſtorical Faith, and yet it is but of the ſame kind, and a thing which m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny Reprobates have, as <hi>John</hi> 2. at the cloſe, it's ſaid, <hi>Many believed on him when they ſaw the miracles which he did, but Jeſus did not commit himſelf unto them;</hi> they were brought to believe from the Signs which they ſaw, that He was more than a meer Man, and that it was the Word of God which He ſpoke, and yet it was but a Hiſtorical Faith; yea this Faith may be, and is in Devils, who are ſaid <hi>James</hi> 2.9. <hi>to believe and tremble;</hi> there are many, who, if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſt to be God and Man, and the Word to be true, think it enough; yet <hi>James</hi> having to do with ſuch, tells them, that the Devils believe as much as that, and more thorowly then many that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Faith; he knows God to be true, and One that cannot lie, and he finds it to his coſt; he knows that ſuch as Believe cannot Periſh, for he cannot get one of them to Hell; he knows that there is a time ſet when Chriſt will come to judge the World, and himſelf among the reſt, and therefore he ſays often to Him, <hi>torment me not before the time;</hi> and as the Devil hath this Faith, ſo there are many in Hell that have it too, the rich Glutton had it, therefore he bids go tell his Brethren that they come not to that place of torment, and its told him, they have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſays that he then felt the truth of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things he would not believe before: This I ſpeak, that ye may know, that this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Faith is the firſt ſtep of Faith, but it may be in Hell, and ſo in many in whom ſaving Faith is not; its really a wonder that Folks that are called Chriſtians ſhould own this to be ſaving Faith, and think they are well come too, when they are only come the Devils length in Believing, yea, there are many that never came his length, elſe they would tremble more. The <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort of Faith, is, the Faith of <hi>Miracles,</hi> which is often ſpoken of in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as when the Lord ſayeth, <hi>If ye had ſaith as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, ye ſhould ſay to this mountain, be thou removed and cast into the ſea, and it ſhould be done;</hi> there was an active Faith to work Miracles, and a paſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152256:32"/> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. <hi>If I had all faith, and could remove mountains, if I want charity, it avails me nothing;</hi> this Faith of Miracles availeth not alone to Salvation, becauſe it acts not on Chriſt holden out in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as a Saviour to ſave from Sin, but on Chriſt, as having power and ability to produce ſuch an Effect; which may be where there is no quiting of a Man's own Righteouſneſs, and if there be not Grace in the Perſon that hath it, it is an occaſion of Pride: We call you then to Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Faith, as neceſſary, though not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but not to this Faith of Miracles, it being neither neceſſary nor ſufficient. A <hi>third</hi> ſort of Faith is <hi>Temporary</hi> Faith, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. and ſet out under the Parable of the Seed ſowen on ſtony Ground, which ſoon ſprings up, but withers; ſo ſome Hearers of the Goſpel receive the Word with joy, and are affected with it, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure not: The difference betwixt this and Hiſtorical Faith, is, that Hiſtorical Faith as ſuch, conſiſts in the Judgement, and reaches not the Affections, at beſt it reaches not the affection of Joy, for though the Devils tremble, yet they are never glad; Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Faith reaches the Affections, and will make a Man, as to tremble at the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, as <hi>Felix</hi> did; ſo, ſome way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light himſelf in the Promiſes of the Goſpel, and to ſmack then as it were from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the ſweet taſte and reliſh he finds in them: It is even here (as it were) told a whole Man, that a Phyſician is come to Town, he is neither up nor down with it, but tell it to a ſick Man, and he is fain, from an apprehended poſſibility of a Cure, yet the apprehended poſſibility of the Cure, never ſends him to the Phyſician, nor puts him to apply the Cure. The <hi>fourth</hi> ſort is <hi>Saving</hi> Faith, which goeth beyond all the reſt, and brings the ſick Man to the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and to make uſe of the Cure; there may be ſome meaſure of true Saving Faith, where there is not much Temporary Faith, or moving of the Affections, and there may be a conſiderable meaſure of Temporary Faith, where there is no Saving Faith at all, even as a fallen-Star may ſeem to glance more then a fixed one that is over-clouded, yet it hath no ſolid Light. Know then, that Faith is called for, but take not every ſort of Faith for Saving Faith; it would make tender Hearts bleed to ſee ſo many miſtake in the matter of their Faith; there are ſome who ſay, they had Faith all their days; O that ye were convinced of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable deceit and deluſion that ye are under, and that ye could diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Faith and Preſumption, betwixt Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical and Temporary Faith, and true Saving Faith, though the two former be not Deluſions, but in ſo far as ye reſt on the ſame, and take them for Saving Faith, ye are deluded, for Saving Faith puts you out of your ſelves to reſt on Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p>THE Goſpel is a ſweet Meſſage, and ought to be glad News when it comes to a People; and therefore, when this Report of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is made to Sinners, O! but it's a ſad Complaint that follows on the refuſal and not welcoming of it; there is no better News a Miniſter can carry, then theſe brought to the Shepherds by the Angels, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>Fear not, behold we bring you glad tydings of great joy to all people; unto you is born in the city of</hi> David, a <hi>Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord;</hi> but were it an <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> it will weight him when he looks on a fruitleſs Miniſtry and deſpiſed Goſpel, and will make him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> O! that we may experimentally know the cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gladneſs that follows the Goſpel where it is embraced, and that we may not know the ſorrow and ſadneſs that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the challenge for diſpiſing of it; one of theſe two the preached Goſpel will be, either it will be joyful News to you, or a ſad ground of complaint to God againſt you.</p>
            <p>We entred to ſpeak of the great Duty of a People that hears the Goſpel, and the great mean whereby theſe News become delightſome, and that is, by Faith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Report of the Goſpel, or to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on Chriſt reported of in it; This is clearly implyed, for the regrate which holds out the ſin, is, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> and therefore the great Duty muſt be, to Believe, and by Faith to receive the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. We come now to ſpeak of the <hi>Uſe,</hi> and becauſe it's the great deſign of the whole Goſpel, yea, it's the deſign of the Law alſo, both of which level at this End and Scope, even Faith in Chriſt. It will be expedient, and no ways impertinent, that we inſiſt a little on this, eſpecially when ſo many thouſands are utterly ignorant of Faith, being Strangers to what Believing in Chriſt is, and ſo great Strangers to the native End of the Goſpel, and out of the way of getting good by the Preaching of it, ſo that to this day, they have not learned this one Leſſon, to wit, concerning Faith in Chriſt, and other Leſſons will be to little or no purpoſe till this be learned.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not inſiſt to ſpeak at large of the Doctrine of Faith, but only in a plain way, glance at what this great Duty is, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the Hearers of the Goſpel; it's Believing in Chriſt ſavingly, or Saving Faith, for no other thing will hold off the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt you; ye will be complained of, though ye would believe with all other Faith, therefore it's this Faith that is here meaned.</p>
            <p>That we may come the ſooner to that which we would be at, we ſhall premit two or three words. <hi>Firſt,</hi> When we ſpeak of Believing here, we preſuppoſe theſe things that are neceſſary for clearing the Object of Faith and capacitating us to Believe, though they be not Saving Faith; As name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1. That the Offer of the Goſpel muſt come to People, that the Object of Faith be held out to them, that it be told them, that there is a way for a Sinner's Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Chriſt Jeſus, and that Sinners may be accepted before God on His account, or through Him.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152256:33"/> an underſtanding of this, a conceiving in the Judgment what it is; Folks cannot Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve except they Hear, and Underſtand what they Hear, in ſo far as diſtinctly to fix their Faith on the thing known; they muſt know and underſtand the Mediator's ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Covenants freeneſs, and the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Faith to make Chriſt theirs. Yea, 3. It's neceſſary there be ſome acquaintance with our own condition, as that we are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally under Sin, that we are loſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curſe, ſick, and utterly unable, and even deſperate to get our ſelves reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, by any thing that is in, or by any thing that we can do of our ſelves, that we are for ever undone if we get not a Saviour, that our mouth may be ſtoped. 4. Not only muſt we know this, but it's neceſſary there be an Hiſtorical Faith of it, to Believe that there is Fulneſs and Sufficiency in Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſt, that He is able to cure, and take away the guilt of Sin in all that reſt on Him; theſe muſt be believed in general, ere ever Sinners can reſt on Him for their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; which ſuppoſes that there may be an Hiſtorical, where there is not a Saving Faith. Now when all this length is gone, Saving Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h is that which the Goſpel cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for, and it is the Hearts acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what ſound light and conviction it hath, on Jeſus Chriſt as holden out in the Promiſe, for obtaining of Life and Salvation through Him; ſo that when the Soul is ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill under its conviction, and knows it cannot have Life but by reſting on Chriſt, and hears that there is a Sufficiency in Him for up making of all its wants, then the work of the Spirit prevails with the Soul, to caſt it ſelf over on Him for obtaining of Life, and of every other thing needful; it brings the Soul to embrace and lay hold on Him, not only as one able to ſave Sinners, but to ſave it ſelf in particular; and this is the native work of Faith that waits the Soul to Chriſt, and pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s it over the bound-road, or march of all Deluſion; it's like a ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man's leaping to catch hold of a Rock or Rope; it's the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inging of a loſt Sinner from the ſerious apprehenſion of his own naughtineſs and undone Eſtate, to caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f over on Jeſus Chriſt for the obtaining of Life through Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When we ſpeak of Faith, we would premit this, That even this true and Saving Faith, which is not only in kind true, that is, ſuch as hath a real Being, but is Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may be conſidered in its different acts or actings for its different needs or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities: Though the Covenant be one, yet the acts of Faith are many, we having to do with Pardon of Sin, with Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its parts, Vivification, and Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, with Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Faith different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acts on Chriſt and the Promiſe for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe. Now, the Faith that we would inſiſt on, is, the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ith that reſts on Chriſt for Pardon of Sin, on which all the reſt of the acts of Faith depend; it's that Faith whereby a Sinner receives Chriſt, and caſts himſelf over on Him; that Faith whereby Union with Chriſt is made up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We would premit, That there is a great difference betwixt Faith, and the Effects of it, as Peace, Joy, Aſſurance of God's Love, and theſe other Spiritual Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges that follow Believing: It's one thing actually to Believe, another thing to have the Peace and Joy that follows upon, and flows from Believing; the one being as the putting out of the Hand to receive the Meat, and the other as the feeding on it: It's the firſt of theſe we mean, and intend to ſpeak of, even that Faith whereby we grip Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf, and get a Right to all theſe Priviledges in and through Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We premit, That even this Saving Faith hath its degrees, as all other Faith hath; ſome have more weak Faith, ſome ſtronger; ſome have that full Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſpoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. or a Plerophory, not only as to the Object that it's ſufficient, but as to the apprehending and obtaining of Life through that Object; ſo that they are able to ſay, neither height nor depth, nor any thing elſe, ſhall be able to ſeparate them from the Love of God in Chriſt Jeſus; we ſay then, that Saving Faith hath its degrees, though the degree be not that which we ſpeak of; but it's the kind of this Faith, whether weaker or more ſtrong, whereby a loſt Sinner rolls it ſelf over on Chriſt; the Faith which puts the Sinner off the Ground
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152256:33"/> it ſtood on, ever on Him; the Faith which brings the Soul from the Covenant of Works to a new holding of Life by Chriſt and His Righteouſneſs. We ſhall then ſpeak a little, 1. To what we conceive this act of Saving Faith is not for precaveat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miſtakes. 2. What way the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſſes it; when then we ſay that ſuch a thing is not Saving Faith, ye would know that thing is not it that ye muſt lippen to; and when we ſay ſuch a thing is Saving Faith, ye would labour to act and exerciſe Faith according to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For what Saving Faith is not. 1. It is not the knowing that Chriſt is God and Man, that He was Born, was Crucified, Dead, and Buried, and Roſe again; Aſk ſome, what true Saving Faith is? they will ſay it's a true Knowledge; Aſk them again, how long is it ſince they Believed? they will ſay ſince ever they knew Good by Ill; ye would know that apprehenſive or literal and ſpeculative Knowledge is needful, but it will not be taken for Saving Faith. 2. It's not a touch of warmneſs or liberty in the Affections in a natural way, which may be in unregenerate Men, yea poſſibly in Pagans, as in a <hi>Felix,</hi> who in the mean time, have not ſo much as Temporary Faith, becauſe it riſes not from the Word, but from diſpenſations of Providence, or from Temporary things; and if it riſe from the Promiſes of the Word, if there be no more, it's but temporary Faith. 3. It is not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, which many take for Faith, and take it for granted if they be convinced of Sin, they Believe, and will ſay, whom ſhould they Believe on but Chriſt, and yet they never follow the Conviction, to put in practice what they are convinced of. 4. It's not ſimply a Reſolution to Believe, as others take Saving Faith to be, who being convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that their own Righteouſneſs will not do their turn, reſolve to Believe on Chriſt for Righteouſneſs, but they will take a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time to do it; and many maintain their Peace with this, though it be no true Peace; but a bare reſolution to Believe is not Faith; ye uſe to ſay, there are many good Wiſhers in Hell. I remember the words of a dying Man in this Place, who thought he believed before, and being aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what difference he conceived to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Faith he had before, and the Faith he now had attain'd to? he anſwered, before, I thought or reſolved to Believe, but never practiſed it, now I practiſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: There is ſuch a ſubtilty and deceit in the Heart, that if it reſolve to Believe, and if it obſervably thwart not with Faith, it will ſit down on that as if all were done, therefore the Word is, <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice,</hi> that is, to day if ye will Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>harden not your heart:</hi> This reſolving to Believe, is like a Man ſinking in the Water, and having a Rope caſt out to him, he reſolves to grip it, but does it not; So, many think they have the Promiſe beſide them, and reſolve to make uſe of it, but do not preſently make uſe of it, and the Ship ſinks down, and they periſh, while the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe abides and ſwims above. 5. It is not Prayer; There are many who think they Believe when they ſome way Repent, Pray, and put their Hand to other Duties, and they know no more for Believing but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that kind; it is true indeed, Prayer may help to Believe, yet it's not always with Faith, it's not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord, that believeth; many will ſeek to enter that ſhall not be able: Folks very often have theſe two miſerable miſtakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Prayer, either they put it in the room of Chriſt, or in the room and place of Faith, not conſidering that they are different things; for Faith exerciſeth it ſelf on Chriſt as Mediator, and Prayer taketh Him up as God, the true Object of Divine Worſhip; though if it be not founded on Chriſt as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, it hath no acceſs; the acting of Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith is properly on Chriſt held forth in the Word, and Prayer is a putting up of Suits according to the Word: There are many that know no more what uſe to make of Chriſt, then if He had never been incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, nor had come under that relation of a Mediator, and make their Prayers ſerve to make up all; whereas Faith, not only reſpects Chriſt as God, but His Merits as Mediator and His Offices. 6. Nor is Faith only a believing this Word of God to be true, though we could wiſh many were
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152256:34"/> come that length; it would make a Man tremble to hear the blaſphemous words that ſome will have, when they are aſked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their believing the truth of the Bible; but though ye were that length, it were not enough, the Devils believe and tremble; the Faith that we call you to, is more then Hiſtorical, it's to reſting on Chriſt, to cordial receiving of the Meſſage which He ſends to you; as, ſuppoſe a King ſhould ſend an embaſſage to a Perſon to woo her to be his Wife, it's one thing to know that there is ſuch a King, another thing to believe that he is real in his offer, and that the Woman by conſenting to marry him, may be, and will be happy, and (which is yet more) actually to receive the Meſſage, and to conſent to go and marry him; It's here as when <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſervant is ſent to <hi>Rebekah, Gen.</hi> 24. She and her Friends believe all the report that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant made of his Maſter and of his Son, that it was true, and then it's given to her option if ſhe will go with the Man, and ſhe conſents to go, and actually goeth; this is it we preſs you to, to go with us and cloſe the Bargain, and to accept of Him, and of Life through Him; by the ſame ſimilitude ye may know what Saving Faith is, and what is the difference betwixt it and Temporary Faith; when the great, rich, and brave offer comes to be made to <hi>Rebekah,</hi> by a Man with many Camels, Gold, and Bracelets, when ſhe believes that it's true, and that it's made to her, ſhe is fain, and it may be over fain, if not ſomewhat vain alſo, that is like <hi>Temporary Faith;</hi> but when it comes to the articles of the Contract, it's ſaid to Sinners, ye muſt ſubject to Chriſt, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low His Will and not your own, this, this caſts the Bargain; thus many when they hear there is a poſſibility of Life to be had in Chriſt, and much more when they hear it's to be had on good, eaſie, and free terms, it will make them ſmile, but when it comes to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.10. <hi>Hearken, O daughter, and conſider, forſake thy fathers houſe,</hi> or the faſhions of thy Fathers Houſe, it halts there, and they ſuſpend and demur to cloſe the Bargain, but <hi>Saving Faith</hi> goes further on, and with <hi>Rebekah,</hi> finally cloſes the Bargain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The next thing is, What is Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, or what is it to Believe in Chriſt? and would to God ye were ready to Believe, and as ready to receive the Invitation as to aſk the Queſtion, and that in aſking the Queſtion ye were in earneſt; for by the way, many have aſked the Queſtion, What ſhall we do to be ſaved? where if they had been in earneſt, they might have been ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; The Anſwer is at hand, Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved: But to them that deſire further clearneſs or confirmation in this concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Buſineſs, we ſhall ſpeak a little, yet ye muſt know, that it's ſuch a thing as is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be made plain to a proud hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured or unhumbled Sinner, it's the poor humbled Soul that will take it up, and to ſuch a Soul, half a word will help to take it up.</p>
            <p>The plaineſt way to ſet it out, as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is, to name ſome Scripture Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Similitudes, that hold it forth, The firſt whereof is in that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come to me all ye that are weary and heavy loaden;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 6.35. <hi>He that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth in me ſhall never thirſt;</hi> readily theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions hold out theſe three. Firſt, An Evil which Men cleave to. Secondly, A Good that is offered to them. Thirdly, A paſſing from the Evil to the Good, and ſo, <hi>come to me</hi> implyes. 1. A hazard that Folks are in by being at a diſtance from Chriſt. 2. That there is acceſs to Jeſus Chriſt for remeiding that evil, and removing of that hazard. 3. A paſſing from the one to the other, a paſſing from our own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, a paſſing from our natural condition to Jeſus Chriſt, a real paſſing from Death in our ſelves, to Life in Him: Moſt part, think Faith to be a conceit, a humour, or a gueſſing, that they think they may have and never know how; but it's a real thing, a coming from our own Righteouſneſs, as I ſaid, to His, from a Covenant of Works, to reſt on Chriſt and His Righteouſneſs, held forth in the Covenant of Grace; this is ſomewhat explained, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. where two Huſbands are ſpoken of, a Woman cannot marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152256:34"/> Man till her firſt Huſband be dead, ſo, till a Sinner be dead to the Law, he cannot marry Chriſt, there muſt be a divorcing from the Law and Covenant of Works ere ye can cloſe with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Expreſſion is, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. Where Faith is held forth as <hi>a receiving</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>To as many as received him, he gave them power to become the ſons of God, even to as many as believed on his Name;</hi> and it's well expreſs'd in the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> to be a receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt as He is offered in the Goſpel; this ſuppoſes that Chriſt is offered to us, and that we are naturally without Him; The Goſpel comes and ſays, Why will ye die, O houſe of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> come and receive a Saviour; And the act of Faith is a gripping to that Offer, a receiving and imbracing of it, a being well content to take a free Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge through His Blood.</p>
            <p>A third Expreſſion is, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. Where Faith is ſet out as an <hi>apprehending</hi> of Chriſt, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. It's called a <hi>laying hold</hi> on the Hope ſet before us, and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.4. a <hi>taking hold</hi> of the Covenant; all which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Folk to have a choice, as it were, laid to them, and Chriſt to be holden out as a City of Refuge, and a Shelter from that which we are in hazard of; Chriſt is held out in the Goſpel as the City of Refuge, and the exerciſe of Faith is to run from the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to Him, as a Child that is chaſed by an unknown and uncouth Body, flees unto the Mothers Arms, or as the Man-ſlayer fled from the Avenger of Blood to the City of Refuge; and Faith having run to Him, caſts it ſelf on Him, or thruſts it ſelf (as it were) into Him.</p>
            <p>A fourth Expreſſion is, <hi>rolling or casting</hi> of our ſelves over upon the Lord, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.22. <hi>Caſt thy burden on the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5. <hi>Commit thy way to the Lord,</hi> it's on the Margent, <hi>roll thy ſelf on the Lord,</hi> or <hi>reſt,</hi> as it's <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. and eaſe thy ſelf on the Lord; the Goſpel lays Chriſt, as it were, at Folks feet, and Faith rolls them over on Him; it's even the Souls finding it ſelf through the work of the Spirit, unable to ſtand under the Burthen; rolling it ſelf on Chriſt, as a crafie and weak Body caſts it ſelf on a Doun-Bed for eaſe; This is a very emphatick, ſignificant, and active Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith, ſetting out a Man quiting his own Legs or Feet, as unable to ſtand on them, and laying himſelf over on Chriſt; This is it that we call you to, even to quite your own Feet, and to roll your ſelves over on Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A fifth Expreſſion is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. Where it's call'd <hi>a ſubmitting to the righteouſneſs of God;</hi> which is held out in the Goſpel, thus, as if a King were proclaiming a Pardon to Rebels, and ſaying to them, for as many hainous Crimes as ye have committed, and are guilty of, if ye will take with them, and betake your ſelves to my grace and mercy, ſincerely reſolving to be henceforth faithful and dutiful Subjects to me, I will freely pardon you; which gracious offer they moſt gladly accept of, and ſubmit themſelves to it: <hi>Submitting,</hi> is an acquieſcing in the terms of the Goſpel, as it is propoſed; It's even as if ye ſhould ſay, we hold the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and are well-content and ſatisfied with it; In a word, Faith carves not to God the way of Salvation, but ſweetly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth to the way He hath carved out.</p>
            <p>A ſixth Expreſſion is, <hi>Hiding of our ſelves in God, or in Christ,</hi> ſo the word <hi>trust</hi> in God, ſignifies, to hide our ſelves in Him as in a place of Refuge, according to that <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. <hi>The Name of the Lord is a strong Tower, the righetous run unto it and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,</hi> or hid, or, they flee to it as Doves do to their Windows; and this is it the Apoſtle hath, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>That I may be found in him not having my own righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that if ye aſk, What is Faith? It's a Man's betaking himſelf to Chriſt, that when he ſhall be called for, it may be anſwered, Lord, I am in Chriſt not having mine own Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is not to be lippen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Man's good Hopes, to his good Prayers, or to his good Meaning, but to Chriſt's Satisfaction, and God's Promiſe; By Faith, when rightly exerciſed, the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner holls and hydes himſelf in Chriſt, till (to ſpeak ſo) a bit of the Man cannot be ſeen; and this is well ſet out by the Lord, when He ſays, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.26. <hi>Come my people, enter into your chambers, ſhut the doors about you, hide your ſelves for a little while,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152256:35"/> come in under the Mediator's Wings, lock in your ſelves by Faith there, and ſo make all ſure.</p>
            <p>A ſeventh Expreſſion is, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.8. Where, when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is writing to the degenerate Tribes to come home again, he bids them, <hi>yield themſelves to the Lord,</hi> in the Original it is, <hi>give the hand to the Lord,</hi> even as two Men who have been at odds and variance, or have broken the tyes that were betwixt them, come to renew the Friendſhip, they chop Hands: Now God is brought in ſtretching out His Hands to you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.2. therefore come and cloſe with Him, yield to Him, give Him the Hand, or chop Hands with Him, and make the Bargain and Engagement ſicker for the time to come; all theſe Similitudes borrowed from Men, are partly to make the Nature of Faith obvious and clear, partly to ſtrengthen and confirm Believers Faith.</p>
            <p>An eighth Expreſſion is that of <hi>opening</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Open to me my dove,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door and knock, if any man open the door to me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts.</hi> 16. it's ſaid, <hi>the Lord opened the heart of</hi> Lydia: When the Word comes, Sinners Hearts are locked on God, Chriſt comes by His Word, and knocks hard to be in, bids open and take in the Saviour, and Faith diſcerns His Voice, and gives Him entry; it's the letting of the Word ſink, the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Him welcome; it's not only the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting of the Word as true, but the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Him whom the Word offers, for the End for which He is offered; and this is, when the work of the Spirit with the Word, wakens up a ſtichilling, or flightering (to ſay ſo) within, and makes the Heart to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to take in Chriſt; as one worded it well and ſignificantly, my Heart clecked as a Lintſeed-Boll to Chriſt; and wherever Chriſt hath a deſign of Grace on the Soul, and comes with Powet, He continues knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rapping and calling hard and aloud, till Doors and Gates be caſt open to Him.</p>
            <p>A ninth Expreſſion or Similitude under which Faith is held forth, is that which is ordinary, <hi>of a Marriage,</hi> or of <hi>covenanting</hi> or conſenting, whether in Marriage or otherwiſe, but more eſpecially in Marriage: When Chriſt taketh on Him the place of an Wooer, Miniſters are His Embaſſadours, the Word is their Inſtructions, wherein He bids them go tell Sinners, that <hi>all things are ready,</hi> and to pray them to come to the Marriage, or to marry and match with Him; and Faith is a coming-away to this Huſb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd, a receiving of the word of Invitation, a conſenting to the Marriage: It's not ſo much a local, as a qualitative change or mutation, we change Faſhions, we ſubſcribe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract on the terms it is laid out to us: In the Bargain of Grace, ſomething is offered by God, and that is Chriſt and His Fulneſs, and there is ſomething done on our ſide, and that is, acccepting of Him by Faith; and this is not ſo much a ſaying with the Tongue, as it is a believing with the Heart, as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>With the heart man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves unto righteouſneſs;</hi> it's the Hearts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſubſcribing the Marriage-Contract, and going away with Chriſt, to live and cohabit with Him, though Confeſſion will be readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Mouth alſo, as He calls for it.</p>
            <p>A tenth Expreſſion or Similitude, is that of <hi>buying, Ho every one</hi> (cryeth the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1.) <hi>that thirſts, come to the waters, and he that hath no money, come buy,</hi> &amp;c. ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Buy of me eye ſalve,</hi> &amp;c. It ſayes this much, that God in the Goſpel ſets forth as in a Mercat, to Sinners, rich and rare Wares, and good cheap, or at very low and eaſie Rates; and that Believing is like buying up of the Wares; Life Eternal is holden out on condition of believing on Chriſt, and the poor Sinner thinks that a good Bargain, for it takes no Money from him: <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. This is called <hi>willing, whoſoever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely;</hi> the Soul hath a good will to the thing. It is held forth by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Expreſſions in the Scripture, it is called a <hi>cleaving to the Lord, or ſticking to him, Joſh.</hi> 23.8. and <hi>Acts</hi> 11.23. it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>hearing, hearkening,</hi> and <hi>enclining of the ear,</hi> Iſa. 55, 2, 3. an attentive concerned, and holily greedy liſtening to, and taking hold of this Offer; it's a cleaving to the Lord, as Woodben or Ivy cleaves to an Oak, becauſe its life depends on it: And <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. and <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. it's called a <hi>chooſing of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152256:35"/> Lord,</hi> and that upon deliberation, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we have need of Him, that He is a Saviour ſuited compleatly to all the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Souls, and that we are warrand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Believe on Him; it's the native act and exerciſe of Faith to choice Chriſt among all the Wooers that are courting the Soul: So likewiſe it's ſet out under <hi>trusting and committing,</hi> Pſal. 37. <hi>Commit thy way to the Lord, trust in Him; I know</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>He is able to keep that which I have committed to Him;</hi> it's to give Chriſt the credit of your Salvation; it's one thing to give a Man the credit that He is true, and another thing to concredit Him with our greateſt concerns; we will credit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whom we will not thus concredit our ſelves to, nor commit our concerns to; the former (when theſe are applyed to God) is Hiſtorical Faith, but this latter is Saving Faith, when we dare truſt and lippen our ſelves to Him, and to His Word, and we think this Expreſſion holds forth as much of the nature of Saving Faith as any of the former, if we could take it up, when we dare concredit our ſelves to Him becauſe He hath ſaid the word: Thus alſo to act and exerciſe Faith on Him, for Temporal, or for Spiritual things, it's to expect the event from God, but ſo, as we expect and look for it on this ground, that Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed it, and we have accepted Him on His Offer, which gives us a right to theſe things needful for us, and purchaſed by Him: It's ſaid <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.5. when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation comes, that ſome made light of it, but Faith, on the contrary, is a laying weight on it, and a concrediting of our ſelves to God on that ground: It's called <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>a delivering up of our ſelves to the word,</hi> and to Him in it; it's even to put a Blank in Chriſt's Hand, to be filled up as He pleaſes,</p>
            <p>Ye ſee then what ye are called to, it is to open to Chriſt, to come to Him, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Him, to roll your ſelves on Him, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves to Him, to give Him cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is there any of theſe unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or prejudicial to you? and if they be very reaſonable and advantageous, (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are,) we would exhort you to come to Him, to receive Him, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Him, to flee to Him, to take hold of Him, to marry Him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Believe on Him, and by believing, be united to Him, and get a right to Him, and to all His Purchaſe; give Him the credit of ſaving your Souls: This we call for from you, and if ye do it not, the complaint in the Text will ſtand againſt you, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi>

            <p>IT's a great matter once to get the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel brought amongſt a People, and ſuch Meſſengers, as may make the ſavoury Report of Jeſus Chriſt unto them; yet this is not all, there is a greater work behind, and that is, to get Chriſt believed on, and to get the Report concerning Him received by the People to whom it is made; This being the greateſt and graveſt work of the Prophets, and of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and the moſt eminent, not ſo much to get a word to ſay, as to get the Word believed; and this is <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s complaint, that though he himſelf brought the Report concerning Chriſt, and foreſaw many moe would bring it, yet, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:152256:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> the exerciſe of Faith in theſe who ſhould hear it would be very rare.</p>
            <p>We ſpoke of the great thing called for from a People to whom this Goſpel comes, and the Report of Chriſt is made, and that is to Believe on Him, to receive and reſt on Him of whom the Report is made; except this be, though there were never ſo many Preachers, and encouragements to Preach, though ye ſhould flock to the Ordinances every day, the ground of Complaint will ſtill remain, if there be not Saving Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, which is the ſubſtance of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>After confirmation of this Point, We ſhew what Faith is from the ſeveral names the Scripture giveth it, and wherein the exerciſe of Saving Faith is holden out, all which imply theſe three. 1. A great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and danger that the Hearers of the Goſpel are in, whether they be ſenſible of it in ſuch a meaſure at leaſt, or not, we ſpeak not now, yet they are ſo really; ſo much <hi>fleeing, coming, laying-hold, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. inſinuate. 2. A fulneſs and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in Chriſt Jeſus holden forth to them, as the object of their Faith, as one that can deliver out of that danger, and can right what ever is wrong. 3. An act, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mainly the exerciſe of Faith is holden forth, and it's the act of the Soul under that danger and diſtreſs, betaking it ſelf to Chriſt's fulneſs for help: It's a fleeing from the Curſe of the Law, to Him, as to the City of Refuge; ſo every name that Faith gets, ſets out a Man acting and moving ſome way for Chriſt's remeeding the evil, and removing the hazard he is in.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken a little to this, that Faith is the main duty that is called for, we may now follow the Exhortation to preſs you to it, it being to no purpoſe to ſpeak of Chriſt and of Faith in Him, except He be received; This is the end of the Word written and taught, <hi>John</hi> 20. at the cloſe, even to believe in the Name of the Son of God, and by believing to receive Life in and through Him.</p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Seing this is the main Duty called for by the Goſpel, that by Faith ye ſhould receive it, and Chriſt offered in it, we earneſtly exhort you to it; It is not ſo much to this or that particular Duty, though theſe be implyed; it's not ſo much to attendance on Ordinances, nor to ſubmiſſion to Diſcipline and Cenſures, though theſe alſo be Duties that we exhort you to; but it's to obedience to the great command of Faith, even to believe on Him whom the Father hath ſent and ſealed; It is to receive this Goſpel, to ſubmit to the Righteouſneſs of Faith, to open to Him that is knocking at the Door, to yield to Him and to give Him the Hand, that bygone Quarels may be removed, and taken out of the way; except this be, we profeſs to you in His Name, that ye bring not forth the Fruit that this Goſpel calleth for from you, and that no leſs will be acceptable to God, nor taken off your Hand by Him.</p>
            <p>And to add here the <hi>third</hi> Branch of the Doctrine, We ſay, that no leſs will do your turn as a neceſſary mean for attaining the Promiſe and that which is promiſed. 1. Look to all the Promiſes, whether of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin, or of Peace with God, of Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, of Holineſs and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God; there is no acceſs to theſe, or to any of them but by Faith; this is the very proper condition of the Covenant of Grace, and the Door whereby we ſtep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; and if ye think Pardon of Sin, Peace with God, and Holineſs to be neceſſary, then this great Goſpel-Duty of Believing is no leſs neceſſary; for the Lord ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believes not is condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</hi> 2. Look to the performance of any Duty, or mortification of any Luſt or Idol, and Faith is neceſſary to that, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.5. <hi>It is by Faith we obtain victory over the world;</hi> it was by Faith (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.) that all the Worthies ſpoken of there, wrought Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. When any Duty is done, of whatſoever nature it be, there is no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it without Faith; It is not our Praying, or coming to the Church, that will make Duty to be accepted, but it's Faith, <hi>the word profited them not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. <hi>becauſe it was not mixed with Faith:</hi> And that for making the Duty acceptable, Faith is neceſſarily requiſite, we may clearly ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. where it is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152256:36"/> expreſsly ſaid, <hi>that without Faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> And how is it that <hi>Abel</hi> offers a more excellent Sacrifice than <hi>Cain,</hi> it was nothing ſure in <hi>Cain</hi>'s Sacrifice it ſelf that made it be caſten, nor any thing in <hi>Abel</hi>'s that made it be received or accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but Faith in the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come, that was found to be in the one, and was a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the other; Is there not reaſon then to preſs this Duty on you? and to exhort you not to think this a common and eaſie thing, though the moſt part think it to be ſo; if we look to the benefites of it, to the difficulty of it, and to the rarity of it in the World, there is no Duty had need more to be preſs'd than this, even that Chriſt Jeſus ſhould get the Burthen of your immortal Souls caſt on Him by this Saving Faith. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the further proſecution of this. Firſt, Shew, what mainly ye would eſhew and avoid, as that whereat Folk more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſtumble. Secondly, What it is we would preſs you to, and on what Grounds.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>first,</hi> I know the deceits and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes in Men about the Exerciſe of Faith, are ſo many, that they are moe then can well or eaſily be reckoned up, yet we ſhall in ſome generals, ſpoken of before, hint at a few of them; for ſo long as ye continue in the ſame Snares, they muſt be ſtill pointed out to you, and endeavours ſtill uſed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive and extract you out of them; and therefore, 1. Beware of reſting on a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal Faith, which before, I called <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical;</hi> We know it's hard to convince ſome that they want Faith, yet we would have you to conſider, that it is not every kind of Faith, but Saving Faith, that will do your turn; it's the want of that which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet complains of: And therefore, to open this a little, ye would conſider, That there may be really ſuch a Faith as is an aſſent to the truth of the Word, in a natural Man, yea in a Reprobate, but that Faith will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unite to Chriſt, nor be waited with the Pardon of Sin. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I do not ſay, that every one that is in the viſible Church hath this Doctrinal Faith, to believe a Heaven and a Hell, that the Scripture is the Word of God, and that all that believe in Chriſt ſhall get Pardon of Sin and Life; the carriage alace! of many teſtifies that they have not this much, whatever fleeting notions they may have of theſe things, or whatever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem they may ſeem to put on the Goſpel, and whatever profeſſion they may make, that they believe the truth of it, yet in their deeds they deny it; for if there were a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in the Doctrinal Faith of the Goſpel in Men, they durſt not for their Souls live as they do. Neither yet <hi>Secondly,</hi> Do we ſay, that all they that have this Doctrinal Faith of the Goſpel, or ſomewhat of it, do believe every paſſage in it alike, but often as they pleaſe them, they believe them: Hence many believe what the Word ſpeaks of Mercy and of Pardon of Sin, and will not queſtion that; but what it ſpeaks of Holineſs, and of the ſeverity of God's reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning with Men for Sin, they do not ſo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit that part of the Word; it's true, where the Faith of the one is, the Faith of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſome way be; but becauſe the one agrees better with their Corruption than the other, therefore the one is not ſo ſo received as the other; and it's very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent with ſuch, to be found diminiſhing from one place, and adding to another, of the Word of God. Nor <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Do we ſay, that all Men do in a like and equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, believe the tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h of the Word; there is in ſome more Knowledge, in ſome leſs, in ſome moe Convictions, in ſome fewer; and though we preach to you all, yet there are ſome that believe not this to be God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, albeit there are many who will not be ſaved, that takes this Word to be the Word of God, and believe what is the meaning of it, becauſe the Word it ſelf ſays it is ſo: And the reaſon of this is, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing that is not Saving, but a Natural Man may h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve it; now, this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal Faith is not Saving, and ſo a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Man may have it, yea, the Devils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and tremble; and <hi>James</hi> does not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute with theſe to whom he writes on this account, that they believe not thus, but tells them, that Hiſtorical Faith was not enough; and we think a man in Nature may have a great perſwaſion of the truth of the Word of God, and that what it ſays will come to paſs, and yet ſtill continue but a Natural
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152256:37"/> Man. A ſecond Reaſon is, Becauſe the Scripture ſpeaks ſo often of many ſorts of Faith that are not Saving, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. at the cloſe, it's ſaid, <hi>the People believed the Lord;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.12. <hi>then they believed His Word, and ſang His praiſe;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 2.23. <hi>many believed on Chriſt to whom He did not commit himſelf;</hi> there was Faith in them, which His Signs and Miracles extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them, which was not Saving; and <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. two or three ſuch acts of Faith are ſpoken of in the Parable of the Sower, that were not Saving, however ſound they might be in their own kind, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. we have ſuch a Faith ſpoken of, as a Man dare not deny the truth of the Word, though he ſhould bring his Body to be burnt by his avouching of the ſame. A third Reaſon is, Becauſe, as much credit may be given to the Word as is given to any other Hiſtory that is creditably believed; and it's on this ground that we believe there was ſuch Men as <hi>Ceſar, Pompey, Wallace,</hi> &amp;c. and it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that there may be impreſſions on the Conſciences of Hearers, that this is God's Word, backed with ſome common work of the Spirit, and that it is generally received to be the Word of God, in the part of the World we live in; what wonder is it that Folk believe thus, and drink in this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical or Doctrinal Faith of the Word, ſo as they may even dare to ſuffer to Death for it? and yet in the mean time, they may want Saving Faith, the Devils being as ſure as any Natural Man is, that God is true, and that His Word will be performed, and therefore they ſay to Chriſt, <hi>Art thou come to torment us before the time;</hi> the Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gs of a Natural Conſcience in Men will aſſure them of a Judgment coming, though they tremble to think on it.</p>
            <p>And therefore ere we proceed further, take a word of <hi>Uſe</hi> from this, and it may let you ſee the great and very general miſtake of the moſt part of the Hearers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, in reſting on this Doctrinal Faith; If ye tell them that they have no Faith, they will not by any means take with that; they believe there is a Saviour, and that He is God and Man, and that ſuch as believe on Him ſhall be ſaved, and on this they reſt: It's ſuch as theſe who think they have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their days ſince ever they had any Knowledge, becauſe the Word was always, or very long ſince, received in the Place where they lived, for the Word of God, and they believe it to be ſo alſo; and know no difference betwixt believing the Word, and believing on Chriſt holden out in it; though alace many of you believe not this much, for if ye were among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ye might be ſoon brought to queſtion the truth of the Goſpel; But though ye had the real Faith of the truth of the Word, take not that for Saving Faith, for as there is a real Sorrow that is not the Saving Grace of Repentance unto Life, ſo there is a ſort of real Faith that hath a real Object, and a real being in the Judgement, which yet is not a real cloſing with Chriſt, and ſo, not Saving Faith; as, ſuppoſe a Man purſued by his Enemy, ſhould ſee a ſtrong Caſtle-door ſtanding open, or one in hazard at Sea ſhould ſee dry Land, if he ſhould ſtand ſtill while the Enemy were purſuing him, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide ſtill in the ſinking Veſſel, the ſight of the Caſtle-door open, nor of the dry Land, would not ſave him; ſo it's not the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is a Saviour come into the World to ſave Sinners, that will ſave, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be a reſting on Him as He is holden out in the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of the Goſpel: Hiſtorical Faith, is only (as it were) a look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Saviour, but Saving Faith grips to Him, and reſts on Him; Hiſtorical Faith looks on Chriſt, but acts not on Him, cloſes not with Him; and therefore ſuch as have it only, and no more, ſink and periſh without getting good of Him: We would think it a great matter to get many of you as far on in Believing as the Devil is, who believes and trembles; the little trembling that is, ſhews that there is but little of this Hiſtorical Faith, yet, as I have often ſaid, this is not all, ye may have this, and yet if ye halt there, ye will certainly periſh if ye were never ſo confident to be ſaved; the Apoſtle doth well diſtinguiſh theſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>He that cometh to God, muſt believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek Him;</hi> where theſe two are preſuppoſed. Firſt, Believing that God
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:152256:37"/> is, or hath a Being. And ſecondly, Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that His Promiſe is ſure and ſicker, that He is Faithful that hath promiſed, and will make His Word good. And then thirdly, On both theſe follows a coming to Him as a Rewarder of diligent Seekers of Him. The firſt two take in Hiſtorical Faith; for to believe that God is, is Natural, and to believe that God is Faithful in His Promiſe, may be in Natural Men; but to come to Him, to get the hazard that the Soul is in, removed through Jeſus Chriſt, is a thing few do attain: This then is the firſt thing we would be aware of, not aware to believe the truth of the Word, but to be aware of reſting on it as Saving Faith; it's not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to look on Chriſt, and to grant that it is He, but the Man muſt never be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied till he get himſelf rolled on Chriſt, and the weight of his Salvation and Peace laid on Him in His own way.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing ye would beware of, is, Some common and quickly tranſient work on the Affections, that may accompany Hiſtorical Faith; Whether the Affection of Grief, or the Affection of Joy be ſtirred thereby, both are unſafe to be reſted on; when ye can't prove your reſting on Chriſt, or where there is no relevant ground to prove it by, though ye ſhould tremble as <hi>Felix</hi> did, and be under allaruming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of Conſcience and fears of your hazard, or though ye ſhould be affected with Joy as the Temporary Believer may be, and ſometimes is, what will that profite you? it's a great miſtake to take ſome ſmall work on the Affections, which at the beſt is but an effect of Hiſtorical Faith, for a Saving work of the Spirit. Or ſecondly, If it be not an effect of Hiſtorical Faith, it's an effect of a challenge of Conſcience, and ſmiting of the Heart, as in <hi>Saul,</hi> who could ſay to <hi>David, Thou art more righteous than I, my ſon</hi> David. Or thirdly, It's ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon work of the Spirit, ſuch as was in <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and who could ſay, <hi>pray for me;</hi> for Folks to conclude on this ground, that they are brought out of Nature into a State of Grace, is to build upon a Sandy Foundation: The Apoſtle ſpeaketh 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sorrow, as well as of a godly Sorrow and as there may be a wordly Sorrow, ſo there may be a carnal Joy, a piece of fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to ſpeak ſo, in Prayer, or at hearing of a Preaching, or at a Communion, which is not Saving Faith; ſome hear the Word with Joy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. who yet <hi>endure not;</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Hearers rejoyced in his Light for a ſeaſon; even as a ſick Man, who hearing (as we hinted before) that a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician who is ſkilful and able to cure him, is come to Town, he grows fain in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of a Cure of his Diſeaſe; but here is the ſtick, when the Phyſician tells the Man that he muſt be ſo and ſo abſtemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and keep himſelf under ſuch a ſtrict Diet, he dow not abide that, and ſo, all his joy evaniſhes: There is ſomething like this in Tempory Faith, where ſome remote expectation of Salvation will cauſe a carnal Joy and Fainneſs; but when it comes to this, that a Man is called to quite his Luſts, or his Eſtate, or, in the World to undergo Trouble and Perſecution for the Goſpel, by and by he is offended, he thinks (to ſay ſo) a Fowl in his hand is worth two flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore when the Storm blows in his Teeth, he turns his Back and runs away: Eſpecially we will find this to be with Men in Sickneſs, they will have mints and ſeriouſneſs, and ſometimes flaſhes of Sorrow under Convictions or Challenges, and ſometimes flaſhes of Joy that will eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh when they come to Health again: When we ſpeak of ſome common work on the Affections, we would take in liberty and ſome warmneſs of Spirit in Prayer, which, no queſtion, even unrenewed Men may find more at one time than another, as when they are in ſome great hazard or ſtrait, they will be more than ordinary ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in that Duty, and yet that may be but an effect of Nature; This proves a great Stumbling and Neck-break to many, that they think they are well enough if now and then they get utterance in Prayer, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they will get words beyond what they expected, and when upon reflecting, they find that they have been in earneſt, though it hath been but with Moral ſeriouſneſs, that blows them up; upon which ground it is,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:152256:38"/> that many ſhuffle in Prayer in the place of Saving Faith, and when they Pray with warmneſs, they trow they Believe, when in the mean time they never knew what it was, in good earneſt to lay themſelves over on Chiſt Jeſus; therefore when we invite you to Believe, this is another thing we would bid you beware of, that ye put not a flaſh of Senſe in the room of Faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is yet a more ſubtile, though no leſs dangerous Miſtake, that ye would beware of, and that is, When Faith is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with Obedience, and is looked on in Juſtification as a piece of new Obedience, with Love, Repentance, and other duties of Holineſs; ſo ſome think they Believe, becauſe they have ſome Natural awe of God in their Walk, and ſome fear of Sin, and do perform ſome duties of Religion, and walk Honeſtly, as they think, according to the Rule; which is to confound the Covenant of Works and of Grace, and to make the Covenant of Works a Covenant of Grace, or to turn the Covenant of Grace into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works; only with this difference, that though their works be not perfect, but defective, yet wherein they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, they think there is worth in their Faith to make up that want, and to ſupply that defect; and ſo by Faith they think they will obtain the acceptation of their works, and of their Perſons on account of their works; they look upon their works as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, but becauſe they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they will believe, or exerciſe Faith, to make up their defects, to which the way of Grace is quite contrary, which makes the Tree firſt good, and then the Fruit; This way that many take, is not to draw the evidences of Believing from works of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is warrantable, but the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith, or their hope of Heaven on works, and the uſe they make of their Faith, is to ward off Challenges for the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their works, and to make Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure aeceptance (as I juſt now ſaid) to their works, and acceptance to their Perſons for their works ſake.</p>

            <p>That which we aim at in this part of the <hi>Uſe,</hi> is to make way for what follows, even to give you a cleanly ground for exerciſing of Faith on Jeſus Chriſt, when all theſe Stumblings and Miſtakes are rolled out of the way: We therefore exhort you, to lay your Hand to your Heart, and narrowly to try, if ye have called, or accounted any of theſe to be Saving Faith; for there are hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, nay thouſands, that periſh under theſe Pretexts, deceiving themſelves, and deluding others, with a Faith they were born and brought up with, and they have no more but their groundleſs hope to prove their Faith by, and they will ſtick by it, be ſaid to them what will; but be not deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for God will diſcover you; ye think a ſtrong preſumption is Faith, and that ye can by ſuch a Faith drink in the Promiſes, but God will make you vomit them up, and ye ſhall be declared to be void of Faith in the great Day; therefore be more jealous over your Faith, and ſeek to have your grips of Chriſt ſickered, which is done, when from the belief of your Hazard and Self-emptyneſs, and of Chriſt's fulneſs, ye go to Him and cloſe with Him, to make up all ye want, in Him; and this Faith is eſpecially qualified by the account on which we go to Him, and reſt on Him, even as a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Duty is that which flows from a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as obedience to it, ſo, one of the main things that qualifies this Faith, is a receiving Chriſt as Chriſt, or as He is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den out in the Goſpel, which is therefore well put in the deſcription given of Faith in the <hi>Catechiſm;</hi> and it's called <hi>a believing on Him whom the Father hath ſent,</hi> which is not to Believe on Chriſt ſimply, but as He is holden out in the Word of the Goſpel; Preſumption may look on Chriſt and His Fulneſs, and few or none will readily dare to give Him a direct and down-right refuſal, or to reject Him profeſſedly and avowedly when they hear of ſuch Happineſs that is to be had in Him; but that which we ſay qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies Faith, is to deſire, receive, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Him according as He is holden out in the Goſpel, <hi>for wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. when He is lippened to with an Eye to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and when that which makes us reſt on Him is the Word of God; for though Chriſt be the material Object of Faith, yet the Word is the formal Object, whereby we get a Right to Him, and there is no grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or getting hold of Chriſt, but in, and according to His Word; and therefore the generality of People (who on the Matter, take the <hi>Antinomian</hi> way) think they have no more to do, but to apply Chriſt, and to count Him their own at the very firſt; but thorow their not exerciſing Faith on the Word of Promiſe, they miſs Him; this is, as I have ſaid, a main qualification of Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, even to reſt on Chriſt as He is holden out in the Word, and by the Word, to take hold of Him, and reſt upon Him; Saving Faith doth not ſimply reſt on Chriſt becauſe He is Merciful and hath all Fulneſs in Him, but it reſts on Him and His Fulneſs as received in the Word, and offered by God in His Word; Faith takes God's Faithfulneſs in His Word, and lays hold on Him by that, Chriſt is the thing that makes H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We ſhall cloſe this with the conſideration of our <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> who was a none-ſuch Preacher, of whom it's ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.29. that <hi>He ſpake with power and not as the Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Luk</hi> 4. when he is opening that ſweet Text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 23. it's ſaid, <hi>They all wondred at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth;</hi> and the Officers that came to take Him, ſay, <hi>that never man ſpake as He ſpoke,</hi> and yet this ſame is His Complaint, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>How often would I have gathered you, and ye would not;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 1.11. it's ſaid, <hi>He came to his own, and his own received him not: Chorazin, Bethſaida</hi> and <hi>Capernaum</hi> were lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to Heaven by the Lord's preaching to them in Perſon, and yet woe after woe is denounced againſt them, becauſe they believed not, for all His Preaching and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; and it's a wonder, if we look tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, how many a ſweet Preaching He had, and with what Weight and Power He ſpoke, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with Tears, and withall, backed His Word with Miracles, that made His Hearers acknowledge the Finger of God, and yet how few were brought to Believe on Him? ſo that He was put to take up this very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> here, <hi>John</hi> 12.38. Is it not a wonder, when He and His Apoſtles have preached ſo much, and ſo long, that the Church is ſo little a Flock, and that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are ſo few in number, even after His Aſcenſion? need we any further proof, that the Goſpel where it comes gets but little welcome? the Carriage of many among our ſelves is a ſad proof of it, for we are afraid that many of you do not Believe to this Day, though there hath been amongſt you, much, long, or many Years, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preaching of the Goſpel, but are ſtill living without Faith, and Periſhing.</p>
            <p>If this be not enough to clear the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. See how Chriſt ſpeaks of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. in the Parable of the Sower of the Seed, where there are three ſorts of Ground that never bring forth good Fruit, and there He ſpeaks, not only of the time of His own Perſonal Miniſtry, but of all times. 2. Look to the ordinary and dayly effect, or rather conſequent of this preached Goſpel, and it will prove it; do not many Periſh? do not many croud thick in the broad Way that leads to Deſtruction? do not but very few Fruits of Faith appear? is there not little, lamentably little, real Change in the Way and Walk of moſt to be ſeen? To clear it yet further, Go thorow the ſeveral Ranks of Perſons, that in God's account are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, and lay them by, O! there will be exceeding few Believers in Chriſt found:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152256:40"/> Firſt, Then lay by the groſly Prophane, that are never ſo much as civilized. Secondly, The Ignorant, Stupid, and Senſeleſs, that never have mind they have Souls, are never feared for Wrath, nor in the leaſt exerciſed to make their Peace with God. Thirdly, The Earthly-minded, that mind no other thing ſave the World. Fourthly, Theſe of a Civil outward Carriage, that have ſome good Works, and as they think, good Days too, and yet come not near Chriſt to cloſe with Him. Fifthly, The Hypocrites, and that of all ſorts, both the preſuming Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, that will thank God they are better than their Neighbours, and yet lippen not to Chriſt, and free Grace through Him, but ſeek to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, groſs as it is; and the legal Hypocrites, that never denyed their own Righteouſneſs, nor ſubmitted to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt: Lay aſide all theſe, I ſay, and we leave it to your own Conſciences to judge, how few will be found to have Saving Faith; and therefore I am perſwaded, if there be any truth of God delivered to you, that this is a truth, that though the Goſpel be preached to many, yet there are but few Hearers of it, that do actually Believe in Jeſus Chriſt to the ſaving of their Souls.</p>

Becauſe for as certain and uſeful a Truth as this is, yet generally it's not believed, Folks can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that ſo few Believe, and that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is ſo difficult and rare a thing: I would aſk you this Queſtion, Was it ever a difficulty to any of you to Believe?

The <hi>first</hi> is, That ſo few of you tremble at the Word of God; the Hiſtorical Faith that the Devils have, makes them tremble, but ye have not that much; this is given as a Property of a ſuitable Hearer of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to whom the Lord will look, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1, 2. that he is one <hi>who trembles at the Word;</hi> but the moſt part of you that hear this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, are like theſe Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A <hi>ſecond</hi> Evidence is, That there is ſo little preparation made to prevent your eternal Hazard, it's ſaid of <hi>Noah,</hi> Heb. 11. that <hi>Noah being warned of God, prepared an Ark,</hi> and this is attributed to his Faith; it's not poſſible that ye would live ſo negligently and careleſly, if ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the Curſe of God were purſuing you, and that ye will be brought to reckon for that which ye have done in the Body, and that ye will meet with God as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; if this were believed, though your Hearts were harder than they are, it would make you tremble, and put you to other

A <hi>third</hi> Evidence is, That there is no Fruit of Faith among many of you, for where it is, it will not be got altogether ſmuthered, but will kythe and ſhew it ſelf one way or other; and if ye will ſtill aſſert your Faith, I would ſay to you as <hi>James</hi> doeth to theſe to whom he writes, <hi>Shew me your Faith by your works;</hi> if ye ſhall ſay, God knows: I anſwer, that ye ſhall find that to be a Truth that He knows, and He will make you know that He does ſo; but alace! that poor Shift will not avail you when it comes to the Puſh, O try your Faith then by your Works; ſee what Mortification of Luſts, what Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from dead Works, what grouth in Knowledge, what ſhining of Holineſs in your Converſation, is attained to; many of you, as to your very Knowledge, are as if ye lived among <hi>Heathens,</hi> many of whom have been as free of Vice, and more profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to others, than many of you are, and cared as little for the World as many of you do; how comes it to paſs then, that ye have lived as if ye could have Faith, and yet have no Fruit? ye muſt either ſay, that Faith is not neceſſary, or that ye may have Faith without Fruit, for we are ſure your Fruit is not the Fruit of Faith: To live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, as you call it, what is that? there are many <hi>Heathens</hi> who have gone beyond you in that; we will not ſay, that Moral Honeſty is nothing, but ſure it is not all; all the Fruits of meer Moral Honeſty, are but ſour Fruits, that will ſet your Teeth on edge: Neither is it your Hearing of the Word only, but your Believing and Doing of it, that will profite you; it's very ſad, that moſt plain obvious Duties are not at all followed, as the ſtudying of Knowledge, the exerciſing of Repentance, one of the very firſt Duties, which is never ſeparated from Faith, the humbling of the Soul before God, the loathing of your ſelves for all ye have done, the Love of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for there may be Challenges for groſs Evils in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;</hi> and Fear is not Repentance, but Godly Sorrow that cauſeth Repentance not to be repented of. A <hi>fourth</hi> Evidence is, The want of that Work of God's Spirit that accompanies Faith, Faith is a ſpecial Work of the Spirit, and the gracious Gift of God, it's wrought by the exceeding mighty Power of God, whereby He raiſed Chriſt from the Dead, and by that ſame Power He worketh in them that Believe; now, knew ye ever what this Work meaned? found ye it ever to be a difficult Work to Believe? knew ye ever what it was to have the Spirit of God conſtraining your Heart to Believe? I ſpeak not of any extraordinary thing; but certainly, Faith is not Natural, nor cometh from pure Nature, and wherever it is, it manifeſts it ſelf by Works, and evidenceth the Power of the Spirit in the working thereof: There are ſome ſad Evidences of, and bitter Fruits that ſpring from this Root, to wit, Folks being Strangers to the experimental Knowledge of the Work of Faith: As, 1. When Men know no more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to get Chriſt, and to reſt on Chriſt, then to believe a Story of <hi>Wallace,</hi> or of <hi>Julius Ceſar.</hi> 2. When Folks ſay that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved all their Days, and believed always ſince ever they knew Good by Ill; and though their Faith be no true Saving Faith, but a gueſſing, yet they will not quite it, yea it's impoſſible for Men to get them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that they want Faith. 3. When Men never knew what it is to be without Faith; it's one of the great Works of the Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. to convince of the want of Faith; Folks will be eaſily convinced, that breach of the Sabbath, that Stealing, that bearing falſe Witneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Sins, where the ſpecial Work of the Spirit is not; but how many of you have been convinced of the want of Faith? we are conſtrained to ſay this ſad word when we look on this Text, that it is lamentably fulfilled in your Eyes, and in this our Congregation; think not that we wrong ſuch of you who have believed our Report; Ah it's few, even very few of you, that Receive and Believe this Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. The ſecond Uſe is for Conviction, If it be ordinary for the great part of the Hearers of the Goſpel not to Believe, let it ſink in your Hearts that it is no extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary thing that hath befallen you; are ye not ſuch Hearers as many of theſe were, who heard <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Christ?</hi> and if
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:152256:41"/> ſo, will not this follow, that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yea, even the thick and throng of the Hearers of this Goſpel, that Believe not? and who if Chriſt were gathering Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by this preached Goſpel, would not be gathered; if where the Goſpel comes many do not Believe, then here in this City where the Goſpel is preached to a great multitude of profeſſing Members of the viſible Church, there are readily many that do not Believe; or let me aſk of you a Reaſon why ye do except your ſelves, either this Truth holds not ſo univerſally, or many of you muſt fall under it, or elſe give a Reaſon why you fall not under it; the Truth which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> preached, hath been preached to you, and yet ye remain Unbelieving, and Diſpiſers of the Invitation to the Marriage of the King's Son, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did; we are not now ſpeaking of <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> nor <hi>Heathens,</hi> nor of the Churches in general, nor of other Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, but of you in <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> that have this Goſpel preached amongſt you, and we ſay of you, that there are few that believe our Report: Think it not our Word, the Application flows natively from the Text, not from neceſſity of the thing, but from the ordinary courſe of Mens Corruption; are not the ſame Evidences of the want of Faith, which we ſpoke of, among you? how many are there in their Life Prophane? how many reſt on Civility and Formality? is there not as little Repentance now as was in <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s time? as little denying of our own Righteouſneſs, and making uſe of Chriſt's, though the Word be taught by Line upon Line, here a little and there a little? It may be, though ye think that the Doctrine is true in the general, ye will not, ye cannot digeſt the Application, That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many of you viſible Profeſſors of Faith, there are but few real Believers; therefore we ſhall follow the Conviction a little further, by giving you ſome Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to make it out, that we have but too juſt ground to make Application of the Doctrine to you, eſpecially conſidering the abounding of Corruption that is amongſt you, that ye may be put to fear the Wrath that attends Sin, and to flee to Chriſt for Refuge in time. 1. Conſider of whom it is that the Prophet is ſpeaking, and of what Time, Is it not of the Times and Days of the Goſpel? had not the Spirit (in dictat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Text of Scripture) an Eye on <hi>Scotland,</hi> and on <hi>Glaſgow?</hi> and do not our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> apply it in their Days? and why then may not we alſo in ours? and when the Spirit ſpeaks expreſsly of the laſt Times, that they ſhall be peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and of the falling away of many, ſhould it not give us the hotter alarm. 2. Do not all things agree to us as to them? is not this Goſpel the ſame? is our Preaching any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than theirs? nay, had they not much more powerful Preaching? and if that Preaching which was much more powerful had not efficacy as to many to work Faith in them, what may we expect to do by our Preaching? are not your Hearts as deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? are not your Corruptions as ſtrong? are ye not as bent to Back ſliding as they were? what ſort of Folks were they that were unfruitful Hearers? were they not Members of the viſible Church as ye are, circumciſed under the Old Teſtament, as ye are baptized under the New? was it not theſe who had Chriſt and His Apoſtles preaching to them? yea, they were not among the more Ignorant ſort who did not Believe, but <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and theſe not of the prophaneſt ſort only, but ſuch as came to Church, and attended on Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as ye do, yea, were ſuch as had Gifts, and caſt out Devils, and preached in Chriſt's Name, as you may ſee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.26. Now when there are ſo many, and of ſuch Ranks, who get no good of the Word, and of ſuch, a great many that will ſeek to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in, and ſhall not be able, to whom Chriſt will ſall ſay, depart, I know you not ye Workers of Iniquity; What can be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that many of you do ſo confidently aſſert your Faith, when there are ſcarcely any characters of Unbelief but ye have them? or, what can be your advantage in keeping your ſelves carnally Secure, when the ſtrong Man, in the mean time, is in the Houſe? and to ſhut your Eyes, and make your Necks ſtiff, and to reſolve, as it were, not only to ly ſtill, but to die in your Unbelief; I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf, that many of you ere long,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152256:42"/> will be made to wonder that ever ye thought your ſelves Believers, and will be galled when ye think upon it, that what ever was ſaid to you, ye would needs main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your preſumptuous Faith. When we bid you ſuffer the Conviction to ſink, let none put it from themſelves to others, but let every one take it Home to himſelf; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we would not have any of you caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looſe what is indeed made faſt and well ſecured, nor overturning a ſlender and weak Building, though it were, to ſpeak ſo, but of two Stone height, if it be founded on a right Foundation, on the Rock; but we ſpeak to you that cannot be brought to ſuſpect your ſelves, when ye have juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to do ſo; ſure, this Challenge and Charge belongs to ſome, yea to many, and we would aſk what ground have ye to ſhift it? how can ye prove your Faith more than others that have none at all? that ye hope ye have Faith, will not do your turn, that's no ſolid proof; ye cannot come to Chriſt except made ſuitably ſenſible of your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and of that ye have never been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced as yet; do ye think to roll your ſelves on Chriſt ſleeping, and ye know not how? certainly when the Pins of your Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle come to be a looſing, ye ſhall find that your fancied Faith ſhall not be able to keep out a Challenge; ye could never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dute to think your ſelves to be Chriſt's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or that ye wanted Faith, but when Death comes, Conſcience will awaken, and the Challenge will needs be in upon you, whether ye will or not; many of you think that ye get wrong when your Faith is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned or reproved, as if it were an odd and rare thing to be Graceleſs, or to be liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Members of the viſible Church, and yet want Faith; and it irritats you to be expoſtulated with in private for your lying in Unbelief: But ſuffer this word now to take hold of you, I b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I fear I be in hazard to be miſtaken about my Faith, and from that, put to follow on to ſee how ye will be able to ward off the Challenge, and to prove your Believing to be ſound, we would think ye were fair on; O if ye had the Faith of this Truth, that among the many Hearers of the Goſpel, there are but few that Believe, and were brought thereby to examine and try your ſelves; there is no Truth that Chriſt inſiſts more on than this, that ſtrait is the Gate, and narrow is the way to Heaven, and that but few find it, and that there are few that Believe, and few that be Saved; If ye did once in earneſt look on your ſelves as in Hazard, and were brought to reflect on Matters betwixt God and you, it might be the Lord would follow the Conviction, we deſire Him to do it, and to Him be Praiſe.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT's a ſad matter, and much to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, when the carrying of ſuch good News as is the Report of Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel, becomes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to them that hear it, and thereby burdenſome to them that carry it; Folks would think that ſuch glad Tydings as make the Heavenly Hoſt of Angels to ſing, would be very joyful and welcome News to Sinners, and alſo moſt heartſome to them that carry them; and where the former is, there the latter will be alſo; where the Word becomes uſeleſs and unprofitable to Hearers, it is burdenſome as to the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant and effect, to honeſt Miniſters that ſpeak it; though <hi>Iſaiah</hi> brought theſe News in a very plain, powerful, pleaſant and ſweet manner to the People he preached to, and that frequently, yet in the midſt of his ſweet Propheſies, he breaks out with this Complaint, <hi>who hath believed our report?</hi> he is carrying glad Tydings, yet taking a look of the Unbelief of his Hearers now and then, he complains of it to God in his own name, and in name of all the Miniſters of the Goſpel that ſhould come after him.</p>
            <p>We ſhew that it was a very ordinary thing where the Goſpel comes in greateſt Plenty and Power, for the Hearers therof to meet it with much Unbelief, a Truth that was verified in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> his time, and that he foreſaw would be verified in the Days of the Goſpel; and therefore it's our Report, not only is it the Report of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> but it is the Report of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>Paul,</hi> who make the ſame Complaint, and Cite the ſame words of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and need we doubt of the truth of it, when <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the Old, and <hi>Paul</hi> in the New Teſtament, thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain? Not to ſpeak of their, and our Lord and Maſter, who <hi>came to his own and his own received him not,</hi> and of whom when He came they ſaid, <hi>this is the heir come let us kill him;</hi> need we, I ſay, doubt of the truth of the Doctrine, or to think it ſtrange to ſee it ſo in our Time, and that we have the ſame Complaint, when the Means (at leaſt the Inſtruments) are incomparably far below what they were then, though it be ſtill the ſame Goſpel?</p>
            <p>The Prophet's ſcope is, to give Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Warning to the Hearers of the Goſpel for the Time to come, of this riſe Evil, even the abounding of Unbelief in them that hear it. 1. That he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Scandal of the unfruitfulneſs of the Word where it comes. 2. That he may add a Spur of excitement to the Hearers of the Goſpel to endeavour to make uſe of it, and not to reſt upon Means, how powerful and lively ſoever they be, but to preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the End they aim and ſhoot at. 3. That he may put Folks to the Tryal, and that they may be brought to look in upon themſelves, whether they be, or be not, in this black Roll of them that receive not the Report; and we think, if any thing put Folks to be ſuſpitious of themſelves, and to commune with their own Hearts about their Souls eſtate, this ſhould do it; eſpecially when they conſider how this Evil agrees to all Times, and yet more eſpecially to the Times of the Goſpel, and how it is an Evil that abounds, not only among the Prophane, but among theſe who are Civil and Zealous too for the Righteouſneſs of the Law, it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:152256:43"/> ſhould make them put themſelves to the Tryal, and not to take every thing to be Faith that they fancy to be Faith; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Doctrine is not true, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Goſpel comes, it meets with Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief in moſt part of its Hearers, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be applyed to this Generation, or, that there is much Faith in this Generation that we live in, that will not be counted Saving Faith: If all of you were Believers, there were no ground for this Complaint, and if we will take Folks on their own word, we can hardly get a Perſon but will ſay he Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, ſo that the generality of Mens Hearts run quite contrary to this Truth; and therefore we ſay, it is the ſcope of this Doctrine and the like, to give Folks the alarm, and to put them to ſuſpect and try themſelves; I do not mean that any ſhould caſt the work of Faith where it is indeed, for that is alſo a part of our Unbelief, and ordinarily when Unbelief falleth on the one ſide, the Devil maketh it up on the other, and makes tender Souls queſtion their Faith when they begin to Believe, as if they could mend Unbelief with Unbelief; but it is to ſuch that we ſpeak, who cannot be brought to ſuſpect their Faith; certainly, ye will wonder one day, that ye ſhould have heard ſuch a plain Truth, and yet would not ſo much as aſk your own Hearts whether there was reaſon to ſuſpect your want of Faith, as it's ſaid that Chriſt marvelled at their Unbelief who heard Him, ſo may we at yours, and who ere long, ye ſhall alſo marvel at your ſelves on this account.</p>
            <p>Before we proſecute this Uſe, and the reſt any further, we ſhall ſpeak to another Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and it is the laſt that follows from theſe words, tending to the ſame ſcope to make us ſcar at Unbelief, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet makes ſuch a heavy ground of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. The Doctrine then is, That if there were never ſo many under Unbelief, and never ſo many who refuſe to receive Jeſus Chriſt, yet Unbelief is a Sin, and a moſt ſinful Sin, which, though Folks had no more, will ſeclude them from Heaven; there were no ground for this Complaint if it were not ſo, even as the Prophet would have had no ground to complain of the Peoples Unbelief if there were not many Unbelievers; ſo Unbelief is a very great Sin in whomſoever it is, and makes them exceeding ſinful: Or take the Doctrine thus, It is a very great Sin for a People to whom Chriſt is offered in this Goſpel, not to receive Him, and reſt upon Him for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as He is offered to them therein; and it ariſeth from this ground, That where Chriſt is not received, there the Miniſters of the Goſpel have ground of Complaint, for it ſuppoſes a great defect in their Duty, ſeing it is their Duty to Believe, yea the great Goſpel duty on which all other Duties hang, and which is called for by many tyes and obligations, <hi>This is his commandment,</hi> ſaith <hi>John</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.23. <hi>that ye believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> therefore it muſt be a great Sin not to Believe.</p>
            <p>There are ſhortly three things compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this Doctrine, (ſpeaking now of Unbelief, not only as oppoſite to Hiſtorical Faith, which we commonly call <hi>Infidelity,</hi> but as it's oppoſite to <hi>Saving Faith,</hi> which we ſhew is that which is called for here:) 1. That Unbelief, or not receiving of Chriſt, is a Sin, or a thing in its own nature ſinful: It's a Sin as well as Adultery, Murther, Stealing, Lying, Sabbath-breaking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are; yea, and in the Aggravations of it, a Sin beyond theſe; it is as contrary to the Word and Will of God, and is as contrary to the Divine Majeſty, as Drunkenneſs, Murther, Adultery, or any other Sin is, the poſitive command of Believing being as peremptory, plain, and particular, as theſe negative ones are, the breach of it muſt be as ſinful. 2. That there is ſuch a kind of Sin as Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, beſide other Sins, and ſuch a diſtinct Duty as Believing, that if Folks could do all other Duties, if this Duty of Believing be wanting, they will be ſtill ſinful, and there will be ſtill ground of Complaint; and if Faith be a particular Duty required, and diſtinct from other Duties and Graces, as it's clear it is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.21. then Unbelief muſt be a particular Sin, diſtinct from other Sins, though it hath influence on other Sins, as Faith hath on other Duties; ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. it's ranked among the moſt abominable Sins,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:152256:43"/> the reaſon why we mark this, is, becauſe there may be ſome in whom ſome groſs Sins, as Adultery, Blood-ſhed, and the like, do reign, and they get that name to be called <hi>Adulterers, Murtherers,</hi> &amp;c. others may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be free of theſe, who yet have Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief reigning in them, and therefore they get that name to be called <hi>Unbelieving,</hi> and are ranked with the groſſeſt of Evil-doers. 3. That even many in the Times wherein the Scriptures were written, and in every Age ſince, are found guilty of this Sin, and condemned for it, who are as to ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things commended; hence it's ſaid <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>they had a zeal of God,</hi> which in it ſelf is good, <hi>though not according to knowledge,</hi> yet it was their main lett and obſtruction in the way to Life, <hi>that being ignorant of God's righteouſneſs, they went about to eſtabliſh their own;</hi> for as much zeal as they had for the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſeing they did not receive Jeſus Chriſt, and His Righteouſneſs by Faith, it made any other good thing they had unacceptable, and the reaſon why we mark this, is, that Folks may ſee that it is not only for groſs Sins, and with groſs Sinners that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel complains and expoſtulats, but it's alſo for not ſubmitting unto, and not receiving the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and therefore ye are far miſtaken that think your ſelves free from juſt grounds of Challenge, becauſe forſooth, ye are free of Murther, Adultery, Drunk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nneſs and the like; do ye not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that Unbelievers ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the ſame Rank and Roll with abominable Whoremongers, Sorcerers, Idolaters, and Dogs? and is not Unbelief contrary to the Command of God, as well as Murth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, Adultery, and theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther groſs Sins? and therefore becauſe Folks think little of Unbelief, though it be very rife, if they be free of other groſs Sins. 4. We ſhall add a fourth thing which the Doctrine implyes. That Unbelief though there were no other Sin, is exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and is <hi>first.</hi> The great ground that makes God expoſtulate with the Hearers of the Goſpel, and that makes them come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Complaint, <hi>John</hi> 5 40. <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye may have life,</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>How often would I have gathered you, and ye would not;</hi> and for ſubſtance, it's the Lord's great complaint of moſt of His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing People, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11. <hi>I am the Lord thy God, open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it, but my people would not hearken to my voice, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me,</hi> and then follows, <hi>O that my people had hearkened unto my voice;</hi> there is no Sin the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains more of than of this, and it's the great complaint of all His Servants. <hi>Secondly,</hi> B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hold how the Lord threatens this Sin, and puniſhes for it, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.7. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.8. where He ſwears in His Wrath againſt Unbelievers, that they ſhall not enter into His Reſt; Adultery and Murther do not more certainly keep Men from Heaven than this Sin of Unbelief doth, yea, they are claſſed together, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. ſee alſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.46. where the ſevereſt Judgment that is executed, is upon Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; and in the Man that had the offer of Chriſt, and did not receive it, and put on the Wedding Garment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.12, 13. ſee it alſo in the words that are pronounced againſt <hi>Chorazin, Bethſaida</hi> and <hi>Capernaum, Matth.</hi> 11. and our bleſſed Lord Jeſus loves not (to ſpeak ſo) to pronounce woes, but to bleſs His People, yet when they have the offer of Life through Him, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, He pronounces woe after woe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and of what ſort were they? even beyond theſe that came upon <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> we think ſuch Threatnings as theſe, ſhould make Folks not to think Unbelief a light, or little Sin, and that there is no ground of quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo long as they are in a Self-righteous-condition, and have not their Peace made with God through Chriſt. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Look further, to the greatneſs of this Sin, in the ſtrange names that the Lord puts upon it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11. <hi>He that believes not, hath made God a liar;</hi> and is there any Sin that hath a groſſer name or effect than this? for it receives not the Report which He hath given of His Son; He tells Folk that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to be gotten in Him only, and they think to be Happy though they take another way; they believe not the Report, for if they believed it, they would receive Chriſt as their Life: See further what names are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:152256:44"/> given to it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.20. which though they be there given, with other Aggravations of ſinning <hi>wilfully, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite,</hi> &amp;c. with reſpect to the unpardonable Sin, yet who are they that live under the Goſpel and Believe not, but in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they will be found capable of moſt of them at leaſt? <hi>It's called a crucifying of the Son of God afreſh, a putting Him to an open ſhame,</hi> &amp;c. and who are they that do this, and on what ground? it's Unbelievers through their Unbelief, they think not Chriſt worth the having, and reject all that is ſpoken of Him, and cry <hi>away with Him,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> did; and as to their particular Guilt, they crucifie Him, for they cannot refuſe Him, without affronting Him, and can there be ſuch an affronting of Him as when He condeſcends ſo very low, to think ſo little of Him? <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions under which He ſets out His being affected, (to ſay ſo,) with this Sin; He was ſo affected with it, <hi>Mark</hi> 3.5. that it's ſaid, <hi>He was grieved for their unbelief,</hi> He had many Sorrows and Griefs, and ſuffered many things, but this grieved Him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way more than they all did; and it's ſaid, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.6. that <hi>He marvelled becauſe of their unbelief,</hi> it's not ſaid that He marvelled at their Adulteries, and their groſs Sins, but that when He was taking ſuch a convincing way to demonſtrate to them His God-Head, yet they would not Believe on Him, He mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at that; ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41. it's ſaid, that when He came near to <hi>Jeruſalem, He weeped over it,</hi> and why? the following words tell us, <hi>O that thou had known in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace,</hi> that is, O that thou hadſt believed, and received the Goſpel, at leaſt in this thy day, (though thou did it not before,) when thou wert, and art ſo plainly and powerfully called to this Duty; and ye may know that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to be ſome great thing that made Him to weep, when all that the Devil and <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> could do, made Him not to weep: It's ſaid <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. that He <hi>upbraided</hi> theſe Cities that He had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much in, on this ground; ſure, when He that gives liberally and upbraids none, does upbraid for this Sin, it ſhews how much He was preſſed with it; and <hi>Luke</hi> 14.21. it's ſaid of this Sin, that it <hi>angered</hi> Him, and He is not eaſily angered; Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners need not fear to anger Him by coming to Him, but when they come not, He is angry; it's ſaid <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.7. He was <hi>wroth</hi> at this Sin, and it's on this ground, that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. we are bidden <hi>kiſs the Son, lest He be angry,</hi> that is, to exerciſe Faith in Him, for if we do it not, He will be angry, and we will periſh. There are other Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of this Sin, which we leave till we come to the Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Is there not as much here, though Folks had no more but their Unbelief, as may make them know it's an evil and bitter thing, and as may make them ſkar at it, and flee from it, and to fear leſt they be found under the Guilt of it, when called to a reckoning, eſpecially when Unbelief is ſo rife, that but few ſuſpect themſelves or fear it; there is hardly any ill but ye will ſooner take with it, then with this of Unbelief, and there is no Duty nor Grace that ye more readily think ye perform and have, then this of Faith, and it is come to that height that Folks think they Believe always, and know not what it is to miſbelieve; do ye think that this preſumptuous and fancied Faith will be counted for Faith, or that Chriſt who ſifts Faith narrowly will let it paſs for Saving Faith? no certainly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Is there not here ground of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, wakening, rouſing, and ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruming to many, that think themſelves free of other Challenges; if the Spirit were coming powerfully to convince of Sin, it would be of this, <hi>becauſe they believe not,</hi> as it is <hi>John</hi> 16.9. and we are perſwaded ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you had need of this Conviction, that never once queſtions your having of Faith, or care not whether ye have it or not: Put theſe two Doctrines together, That Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is an abominable Sin, and that it is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, a very rife Sin, and let them ſink deep into your Hearts, and they will put you to other thoughts of Heart, if this plain Truth of God prevail not with you, we know not what will do it; but the time cometh when ye ſhall be undenyably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of both, that Unbelief is a great Sin,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152256:44"/> and that it is a very rife Sin, and of this alſo, that it is an abominable and loathſome thing, and very prejudicial and hurtful to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. And therefore, as a third Uſe, If it be ſo, let us aſk this Queſtion, How comes it to paſs, that ſo many in trying their State, and in grounding of it, lay ſo little weight on Faith, and think ſo little of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief? I am ſpeaking to the generality of you, and let not others wrong themſelves, nor miſtake the intent of this Scripture; How is it, I ſay, that the generality of you that hear this Goſpel, come under this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and epidemick Temper, or rather Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, to maintain your Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, when ye can (in the mean time) give ſo little proof of it? think ye that Faith cannot be a miſſing, nor miſtaken, or that it is ordinary and common, or that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different whether ye have it or not? we are perſwaded, that many of you think, that if ye have a good Mind, (as ye call it,) and a ſquare civil honeſt Walk, and keep ſtill your good Hope, that all will be well; ye never doubt nor queſtion whether ye have received Chriſt or not, but if Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief ly in your Boſom, (I mean not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-deſperation, or queſtioning of the God-head, but the not receiving of Chriſt and His Righteouſneſs,) though ye had more than ordinary Hypocrites have, ye will for this Sin of Unbelief find your ſelves under the ſtanding Curſe of God, for our Lord ſays, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believes not is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 36. <hi>the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In preſſing of this <hi>Uſe,</hi> I ſhall ſhew by a few Aggravations of this Sin, why the Lord layeth ſo much weight upon it, and that, not ſo much as it oppoſeth Faith, as as it is a condition of the Covenant of Grace, and a mean to unite us to Chriſt, but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Sin thwarting His Command: And, 1. It thwarteth with both the Law and the Goſpel, it thwarteth with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the firſt Table, and ſo is a greater Sin than Murther or Adultery, nay than Sodomy, though theſe be great, vile, and abominable Sins; which may be thought ſtrange, yet it's true, it makes the Perſon guilty of it, more vile before God, than a Pagan-Sodomite; the nature of the Sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more hainous, as being againſt the firſt Table of the Law, in both the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commands thereof, it being by Faith in God that we make God our God, and worſhip God in Chriſt acceptably: Next, its not only a Sin againſt the Law, but a Sin againſt the Goſpel, and the prime Flower (to ſpeak ſo) of the Goſpel; it comes in contradiction to the very deſign of the Goſpel, which is to manifeſt the glory of the Grace of God, in bringing Sinners to believe on Chriſt, and to be ſaved through Him; but He can do no great things of this ſort amongſt unbelieving People, becauſe of their Unbelief; it bindeth up His Hands, as it were, (to ſpeak ſo with reverence) that He cannot do them a good turn. 2. It ſtrikes more nearly againſt the Honour of God, and of the Mediator, and doth more prejudice to the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and cauſeth greater deſtruction of Souls than any other Sin; it's poſſible, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of other Sins, that Chriſt may have ſatisfaction for the travel of His Soul, and there may be a relation bound up betwixt Him and Sinners notwithſtanding of them, but if this Sin of Unbelief were univerſal, He ſhould never get a Soul to Heaven; the ſalvation of Souls is called <hi>the pleaſure of the Lord,</hi> but this obſtructs it, and cloſeth the Door betwixt Sinners and acceſs to God; it ſtrikes alſo at the main Fruit of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, it makes them complain to God, that the Word is not taken off their Hand, it fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats the very end of the Miniſtry, and it comes neareſt the deſtruction of immortal Souls; we need not ſay, it brings on, but it holds and keeps on the Wrath of God on Sinners for ever, <hi>He that believes not,</hi> (as we ſhew before from <hi>John</hi> 3.) <hi>is condemned already, and the wrath of God abides on him.</hi> 3.

There is no Sin that hath ſuch a train of ſad Conſequents following on It; it's that which keeps all other Sins liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for none hath victory over any Sin but the Believer, the Unbeliever lyes as a bound Slave to every Sin, and it's impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come to the acceptable performance of any Duty without Faith, for none can come ſutably to any Duty without a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and can any but a Believer comfort himſelf in uſe-making of any Promiſe?</p>
            <p>We ſhall cloſe our Diſcourſe, with ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word to that which we hinted at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, even to let you ſee, not only the rife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Unbelief, but the great hazard that flows from it, and the exceeding great evil of it; if we be only convinced of the rife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, it will not much trouble us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we be alſo convinced and believe the hazard of it; but if we were convinced of both, through God's bleſſing it might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect us more and neceſſitate us to make more uſe of Chriſt; ye that ſtand yet a diſtance from Chriſt, can ye endure to ly under this great Guilt and ground of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traverſie that is betwixt Him and you? do ye think little to hazard on His Upbraidings and Woes, even ſuch Woes as are beyond theſe that came on <hi>Sodom,</hi> the heavy Curſe and Malediction of God? and yet we ſay to you who are moſt civil, diſcreet, formal, and blameleſs in your Converſation, if there be not a fleeing in earneſt to Chriſt, and an exerciſing of Faith on Him, the Wrath of God not only waits for you, but it abides on you; O tremble at the thoughts of it, it were better to have your Head thruſt in the Fire, than your Souls and Bodies to be under the Wrath and Curſe of God for ever; it's not only the Ignorant, prophane Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, Swearer, Adulterer, Whoremonger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we have to complain of, and expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with, but it's the Unbeliever, who, though He be lift up to Heaven, ſhall be caſt down to the Pit of Hell: If ye aſk, what is all this that we would be at? it's only this in a word, we would have you receiving Chriſt, if ye think that Unbelief is an exceeding great Evil, and that it's an horribly hazardous thing to ly under it, then haſte you out of it to Chriſt; O! haſte, haſte you out of it to Chriſt; kiſs the Son leſt He be angry, embrace Him, yield to Him; there is no other poſſible way to be free of the Evil, or to prevent the hazard.</p>

            <p>IT's a great encouragement and delight to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and it's comfortable and refreſhing to Hearers, when the Meſſage of the Goſpel is received, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is welcomed; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it's burdenſome and heavy when there are few or none that believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Report, when their labour and ſtrength is ſpent in vain, and when all the aſſemblings of them together that hear the Word of the Goſpel, is but a trading of the Lord's Courts in vain; if there were no more to prove it, this Complaint of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſpeaking in His own name, and in name of all the Miniſters of the Goſpel, is ſufficient; for as comfortable Meſſages as he carried, (and He carried as comfortable Meſſages as any that we hear of,) yet there was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral non-profiting by the Word of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in his Mouth; when we meet with ſuch words as theſe, our Hearts ſhould tremble, when we conſider how general and rife an Evil Unbelief and the not receiving of Chriſt is, how horrible a Sin, how abominable to God, and how hazardous and deſtructive to our ſelves it is, and how rare a thing it is to ſee or find any Number believing and receiving this Meſſage of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>We ſpoke from theſe words to theſe <hi>Doctrines. First,</hi> That where the Goſpel comes, it makes offer of Jeſus Chriſt to all that Hear it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the great thing called for in the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>We would now proſecute the <hi>Uſe</hi> and Scope of this. The laſt <hi>Uſe</hi> was an Uſe of Conviction of, and Expoſtulation with the Hearers of the Goſpel, for their being ſo Fruitleſs under it, ſerving to diſcover a great Deceit among Hearers, who think they Believe and yet do it not; whence it is that ſo many are miſtaken about their Souls S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We ſhall not again repeat what Faith is, only in ſhort it comes to this, That ſeeing Chriſt hath ſatisfied Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for Sinners, and His Satisfaction is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Goſpel to all that will receive it, even to all the Hearers of the Goſpel, that Sinners in the ſight and ſenſe of their loſt condition would flee unto Him, receive and reſt upon Him and His Satisfaction,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152256:46"/> for Pardon of Sin, and making of their Peace with God: Is there need of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwade you to this? if ye be convinced of your ſinfulneſs, and of your loſt eſtate without Chriſt, and that there is a Judgment to come when Sinners muſt appear before Him, and be judged accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that which they have done in the Body, and if ye have the Faith of this, that Sinners that are not found in Chriſt, cannot ſtand; (as by the way, wo to that Man that is not found in Him, if it were a <hi>Paul,</hi> for even he, he is only happy by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found in Him not having his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs but Chriſts,) and withall, that there is no other way to be found in Him but by Faith, (which is that which <hi>Paul</hi> hath for his main ſcope, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9, 10.) Then to be found in Him by Faith, ſhould be your main work and ſtudy; this is it that we ſhould deſign and endeavour, and to this we have acceſs by the Goſpel; and it is in ſhort, to be denuded of, and denied to our own Righteouſneſs, as to any weight we lay upon it for our Juſtification before God, and to have no other thing but Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs offered in the Goſpel, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Faith to reſt upon for Juſtification, and making of our Peace with God: This is it that we command you to flee to, and by all means to ſeek an Intereſt in, that when the Goſpel makes offer of Chriſt, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs through His Satisf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152256:46"/> Chriſt, ſhall be made forthcoming to Believers in Him, and by which loſt Sinners that by Faith flee unto Him, have a ſolid Right to His Satisfaction, which will bear them out before God; by which tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, Chriſt's Satisfaction is made as real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theirs, when by Faith it is cloſed with, as if they had ſatisfied and payed the Price themſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He who knew no ſin, was made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in Him;</hi> and this Conſideration of the legality and order of the Covenant, ſerves exceedingly to clear our Faith as to the Ground of it, becauſe by this Covenant it's tranſacted and agreed upon, that Chriſt ſhall undergo the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that the Believer in Him ſhall be reckoned the righteous Perſon; if there be a reality in Chriſt's Death and Satisfaction to Juſtice, if He hath undergone the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and payed their Debt, there is a reality in this Tranſaction, as to the making over of what He hath Done and Suffered, to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Him; and the Covenant being ſure and firm as to His part, He having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it by His Death, it is as ſure and firm as to the Benefite of it to the Believer in Him. 3.

               </gap>r of this Grace in the Goſpel, and the nature of the Goſpel that makes the Offer of the fulneſs that is in Chriſt by vertue of the Covenant; It is the Word of God, and hath His Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity when we preach it according to His Command, as really as when He preached it Himſelf in <hi>Capernaum,</hi> or any where elſe, even as the authority of a King is with his Ambaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We are ambaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us,</hi> there, is the <hi>Father</hi>'s Warrand and Name interpoſed, and for the <hi>Son</hi>'s, it follows, <hi>We pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconciled to God;</hi> add to this, the nature of the Offer, and the terms of it, there is no condition required on our part, as the preciſe condition of the Covenant, but Believing; Now, when theſe are conjoined, we put it to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, if ye have not a good Ground to lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to, and a ſufficient Foundation to build on? and if ſo, it ought to be an powerfully attractive Motive to draw you to Believe in Him, and to bring you to reſt on Him by Believing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have alſo many Warrands and Encouragements to ſtep forward, and when Chriſt in His Fulneſs lays Himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, to roll over your ſelves on Him, and to yeeld to Him; If we could ſpeak of them ſutably, they are ſuch as may remove all ſcarring that any might have in coming to Him, and may ſerve to leave others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, and unanſwerably to convince them that the main obſtruction was in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that they would not come unto Him for Life, He called to them but none would exalt Him. 1. Do ye not think that the Offer of this Goſpel is a ſufficient War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, and ground of Encouragement to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on Him? and if it be ſo to others, ought it not to be a ſufficient Warrand and Encouragement to you? when He ſays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.10. <hi>Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it,</hi> what excuſe can ye have to ſhift or refuſe the Offer? if ye think Chriſt real in His Commands, is He not as real in His Offers? 2. He hath ſo ordered the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of this Goſpel, as He hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely prevented any ground that Folks may have of ſcarring to cloſe with Chriſt; He hath ſo qualified the Object of this Grace in the Goſpel, that theſe in all the World that Men would think ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, are taken in to be Sharers of it, for its <hi>Sinners, loſt Sinners, Self-deſtroyers, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, the Sheep that have wandered, the Poor, the Needy, the Naked, the Captives, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, the Blind,</hi> &amp;c. according to that of <hi>Iſa:</hi> 61.1, 2. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, He hath ſent me to preach glad tyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the meek or poor, to bind up the broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, the opening of the priſon to them that are bound,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. Theſe who are invited to come to the cryed Fair of Grace, are ſuch as are <hi>thirſty,</hi> and ſuch as <hi>want money;</hi> who among Men uſe to be ſecluded, but in Graces-Mercat they only are wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, it's to them that Grace ſays, <hi>He come,</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whoſoever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely,</hi> it's not only, to ſay ſo with reverence, theſe whom He willeth, but it's, <hi>whoſoever will;</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:152256:47"/> and ſo if thou wilt come, Grace puts the Offer into thy Hand, as it were, to carve on; to let us know that He allows ſtrong Conſolation on Believers, and that either the Hearers of this Goſpel ſhall Believe, or be left without all excuſe; He hath it to ſay, as it is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. <hi>what could I have done to my vineyard that I have not done;</hi> If ye had the Offer at your own carving, what could ye put more in it? it cannot be more free than <hi>without money,</hi> it cannot be more ſeriouſly preſs'd than with a <hi>Ho,</hi> and <hi>Oyes,</hi> to come; Sometimes He complains, as <hi>John</hi> 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have life,</hi> and ſometimes weeps and moans becauſe Sinners will not be gathered, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41, 42. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. can there be any greater evidences of reality in any Offer? A third Warrand is from the manner and form of Chriſt's Adminiſtration, He hath condeſcended to make a Covenant, and many Promiſes to draw Folks to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to which He hath added His Oath, ſwearing by Himſelf, when He had not a greater to ſwear by, for our Confirmation and Conſolation, as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16, 17. And among Men, ye know, that an Oath puts an end to all Contraverſie, and what would ye, or could ye ſeek more of God, than His Saying, Writing, and Swearing? He hath done all this, <hi>that the heirs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe may have ſtrong conſolation, who are fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d for refuge to the hope ſet before them;</hi> O! will ye not trow and credit God when He ſwears? Among other Aggravations of Unbelief this will be one, that by it ye make God not only a liar, but perjured, a heavy, hainous, and horrid Guilt on the ſcore of all Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers of this Goſpel. 4. To take away all Contraverſie, He hath interpoſed His Command, yea it's the great Command, and in a manner, the one Command of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ye believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and therefore the Offer of the Goſpel and Promulgation of it, cometh by way of Command, <hi>Ho come, believe,</hi> &amp;c. whereby the Lord would tell the Hearers of the Goſpel, that it is not left to their own option, or as a thing indifferent to them to Believe or not to Believe, but it's laid on them by the neceſſity of a Command to Believe; and if ye think ye may and ſhould Pray, ſanctifie the Sabbath, or obey any other Command becauſe He bids you, there is the ſame Authority enjoyning and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding you to Believe, and as great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity lyeth on you to give obedience to this Command as to any other, do not therefore think it Humility not to do it, for Obedience is better than Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>For your further Encouragement to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, I would ſay three words which ye would alſo look upon as Warrands to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and by them know that it is a great Sin not to Believe. 1. Ye have no leſs Ground or Warrand than ever any that went before you had; <hi>David, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. had no better Warrand; my meaning is, ye have the ſame Covenant, the ſame Word and Promiſes, Chriſt and His Fulneſs, God and His Faithfulneſs offered to you, the ſame Warrand that God hath given to all His People ſince ever He had a Church; and do ye not think but it will be a ſad and grievous ground of Challenge againſt you, when ye ſhall ſee others that believe on the ſame Grounds that ye have, ſit down in the Kingdom of Heaven, and your ſelves as proud Rebels ſhut out? what ever d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fference there be as to the main Work of Grace, and of God's Spirit on the Heart in the working of Faith, yet the Ground of Faith is the Word that all hear who are in the viſible Church, and ye having the ſame Ground and Object of Faith in your offer, there will be no excuſe for you if ye do not Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. A ſecond Encouragement is, That the Ground of Faith is ſo ſolid and good, that it never diſappoints any one that leans to it; and count the Goſpel a feckleſs and inſignificant thing who will, it ſhall have this Teſtimony. which damned Unbelievers ſhall carry to Hell with them, that <hi>it was the power of God to ſalvation to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> and that there was nothing in the Goſpel it ſelf that did prejudge them of the good of it, but that they prejudged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who did not lippen to it; Therefore the Word is called <hi>Gold tryed in the fire;</hi> all the Promiſes having a Being from <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> Himſelf, on jot or one title of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152256:47"/> fail nor fall to the Ground. 3. If ye were to carve out a Warrand to your ſelves, as I hinted before, what more could ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire? what miſs ye in Chriſt? what Clauſe can ye deſire to be inſert in the Covenant that is not in it? It contains Pardon of Sin, Healing of your Backſlidings, and what not? and he hath ſaid, ſealed, and ſworn it, and what more can ye require? Therefore we would again exhort you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and in His ſtead, not to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect ſo great a Salvation, O! receive the Grace of God, and let it not be in vain.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place, Let us ſpeak a word or two to ſome Objections, or Scruples, which may be moved in reference to what hath been ſaid. And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> It may be ſome will ſay, that the Covenant is not broad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, becauſe all are not elected, all are not redeemed nor appointed to be Heirs of Salvation; upon which ground Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will ſometime ſo far preva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l, as to waken up a ſecret enmity at the Goſpel: But, 1. How abſurd is this Reaſoning? Is there any that can rationally deſire a Covenant ſo broad, as to take in all as neceſſarily to be ſaved by it? there is much greater reaſon to wonder that any ſhould be Saved by it, then there is if all ſhould Periſh; beſide, we are not now ſpeaking to the Effects, but to the Nature of the Goſpel, ſo that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Periſh, it is not becauſe they were not elected, but becauſe they believed not; and the Bargain is not of the leſs worth, nor the leſs ſure becauſe ſome will not Believe; and to ſay, that the Covenant is not good enough becauſe ſo many Periſh, it's even as if ye ſhould ſay, it's not a good Bridge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome will not take it, but adventure to go thorow the Water and ſo drown them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. 2. I would aſk, Would ye over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the whole Courſe of God's Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and of the Covenant of His Grace? did He ever <hi>à priori,</hi> or at firſt Hand, tell Folks that they were elected? who ever got their Election at the very firſt revealed to them? or, who are now before the Throne that ever made the keeping up of this ſecret from them, a Bar or Impediment to their Believing? God's Eternal Purpoſe or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is not the Rule of our Duty, nor the Warrand of our Faith, but His revealed Will in His Word; let us ſeek to come to the knowledge of God's Decree of Election <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> or by the Effects which is a ſure way of Knowledge; our thwarting with His Word to know His Decree, will not excuſe, but make us more guilty; <hi>He hath ſhewed thee O man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Micah, chap.</hi> 6.8. <hi>what is good, and what doeth the Lord require of thee;</hi> and if any will ſcruple and demur on this ground to cloſe the Bargain, let them be aware that they provoke Him not to bring upon them their own fears, by continuing them under that ſcrupling and demurring condition; Ye cannot poſſibly evite hazard by looking on only, and not making uſe of Chriſt; therefore do not bring on your own ruine by your fear, which may be by Grace prevented, and by this way of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſhall be certainly prevented.</p>
            <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> Some may object and ſay, I am indeed convinced that Believing is my Duty, but that being a thing that I cannot do, why ſhould I therefore ſet about it? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is a moſt unreaſonable and abſurd way of Reaſoning, for if it be given way to, what Duty ſhould we do? we are not of our ſelves able to Pray, Praiſe, keep the Lord's Day, nor to do any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Duty, ſhall we therefore abſtain from all Duties? Our ability or fitneſs for Duty, is not the rule of our Duty, but God's Command; and we are called to put our Hand to Duty in the ſenſe of our own Inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, acknowledging God's Sufficiency, which if we did, we ſhould find it go better with us, and may not the ſame be expected in the matter of Believing as well as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Duties? 2. None that ever heard this Goſpel ſhall in the Day of Judgement have this to Object, none ſhall have it to ſay, that they would fain have believed, but their meer Infirmity, Weakneſs, and Inability did imped them; for though it be our own Sin and Guilt that we are unable, yet where the Goſpel comes that is not the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie; But that Folks would not come to Chriſt, would not be gathered, that when He would, they would not; for where there is a will, to will and to do go together; But it's Enmity at the way of Believing, Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:152256:48" rendition="simple:additions"/> Stupidity, Senſeleſneſs, and Careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs what become of the Immortal Soul, that ruines Folks; for the Soul that would fain be at Chriſt, ſhall be helped to Believe, the reaſon is, becauſe the nature of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and of the Mediator there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is ſuch, that all to whom He gives to will, He gives them alſo to perform, and His Faithfulneſs is engaged ſo to do: It muſt therefore return to one of theſe two, That either ye will not receive Him, or elſe ye are willing though weak; and if ye be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Faithful is He that hath called you, who alſo will do it;</hi> but if it halt at your Perverſneſs and wilful Refuſal of the Offer, there is good reaſon that in God's Juſtice ye ſhould never get good of the Goſpel; nay, there is never one to whom the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel comes, and who doeth not Believe, but formally, as it were, he paſſeth a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on himſelf, as the word is, <hi>Act.</hi> 13 46. <hi>Ye judge your ſelves unworthy of eternal life,</hi> which the Apoſtle gathers from this ground, that they did not, neither would accept of Jeſus Chriſt offered to them in the Goſpel; as the event is that follows on the Offer, ſo will the Lord account of your receiving of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As for Directions to help and further you to Believe, it's not eaſie, but very difficult to give them, it being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſatisfie the curioſity of Nature; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any Directions be preſcribed that without the ſpecial work of God's Spirit, can effectuate the thing; the renewing of the Will, and the working of Faith being Effects and Fruits of omnipotent Grace; yet becauſe ſomething lyes upon all the Hearers of the Goſpel as Duty, and it being more ſuitable and congruous, that in the uſe of Means, then when Means are neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Believing ſhould be attained; And becauſe oftentimes theſe that deſire this Queſtion to be anſwered, to wit, how they may win at Believing? are ſuch as have ſome beginnings of the work of Grace and of Faith. We ſhall ſpeak a few words to ſuch as would be at believing and exerciſing of Faith on Jeſus Chriſt; And, 1. Folk had need to be clear in the common fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truths of the Goſpel, they would know what their Natural Eſtate is, what their Sin and Miſery is, and they would know the way how to win out of that State; Ignorance often obſtructs us in the way of Believing, <hi>How ſhall they believe on Him of whom they have not heard?</hi> Rom. 10.14. when Folks Believe not, it is as if they had never heard. 2. When ye have attained to the knowledge of the common Truths of the Goſpel, as of your Sin and Miſery, the nature of the Covenant, the Mediator and His Fulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Labour to fix well the Hiſtorical Faith of them, we are ſure that many never come this length to believe the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, and till that be, they can advance no further; for as the word is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>He that comes to God, must believe that He is, and a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek Him;</hi> I ſay, theſe common ſimple Truths of the Goſpel would well be fixed by a Hiſtorical Faith; and yet this would not be reſted on, becauſe though they be excellent Truths, yet they may be known and hiſtorically believed where Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith and Salvation follow not. 3. Be much in Thinking, Meditating, and Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of, and on theſe things, let them ſink down into your Hearts, that the Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them may fix the Faith of them, and that they may deeply affect us, we would ſeek to have a morally ſerious feeling of them, as we have of the common works of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; But there are many like the <hi>Way ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearers,</hi> who, as ſoon as they hear the Word, ſome Devil, like a Crow, comes and picks it up; therefore to prevent this, ye would ſeek to have the Word of God dwelling richly in you, ye would meditate on it till ye be convinced of your hazard, and get the Affections ſome way ſtirred accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of the Word ye me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon, whether Threatnings or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; the moſt part are affected with nothing, they know not what it is to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at a Threatning, nor ſmile as it were, on a Promiſe, through their not dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the thoughts of the Word that it may produce ſuch an Effect. 4. When this is done, Folks would endeavour a full up-giving with the Law of Righteouſneſs as to their Juſtification, that if they cannot
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:152256:48"/> ſo poſitively and ſtayedly win to reſt on Jeſus Chriſt and His Righteouſneſs, yet they may lay the weight of their Peace with God on no other thing; they would lay it down for a certain concluſion, that by the works of the Law they can never be juſtified, and would come with a ſtoped Mouth before God; thus tender Chriſtians will find it ſometimes eaſier, to give up with the Law, then to cloſe with the Goſpel, as to their diſtinct apprehenſion of the thing. 5. When this is done, Go as it were to the top of mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> and take a look of the pleaſant Land of Promiſes, and of Chriſt held out in them, and let your Soul ſay, O! to have the Bargain well cloſed, to have my Heart ſtirred up to love Him, and to reſt upon Him, O! to have Faith and to diſcern it in its actings; for when the Life of Faith is ſo weak that it cannot ſpeak, yet it may breath; and though ye cannot exerciſe Faith as ye would, ſo as to grip to, and catch faſt hold of the Object, yet eſſay ſeriouſly to do that far, as to eſteem, love, and vehemently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it; In this reſpect the Will is ſaid to go before the Deed, though as to God's begetting of Faith there be a contemporari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Will and the Deed, yet as to our ſenſe the Will outruns the Deed, even as in another ſenſe (though it makes well for this purpoſe,) the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I know not;</hi> for we ought to have our Will running after Chriſt, and Believing on Him when we cannot attain to the diſtinct actings of it.</p>
            <p>But it may be here objected and ſaid, Is not this Preſumption? <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this were Preſumption, then all we have ſaid of the Warrand of the Goſpel to Believe, is to no purpoſe; Chriſt never counted it Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to deſire and endeavour in His own way to believe on Him for attaining of Life through Him; To deſire Heaven and Peace with God, and to miſken Chriſt and paſs Him by, were indeed Preſumption, but it is not ſo, to deſire theſe through Him. 6. When ye have attained to this Heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, if ye cannot diſtinctly to your ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction act Believing on Chriſt, ye would firmly reſolve to believe and eſſay it, and ſay, This is the way I will and muſt take, and no other, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>O my ſoul, thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord, thou art my Lord;</hi> Hence the exerciſe of Faith is called a <hi>chooſing</hi> of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.19. and <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. and ſeriouſly, ſincerely, and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to reſolve thus, is our Duty when we can win to do no more; and it is no little advancement in Believing, when ſuch reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to Believe, is deliberatly and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come under. 7. When this is done Folks would not hold at a reſolution, for to reſolve and not to ſet forward will be found to be but an empty reſolution; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having reſolved, (though ſtill looking on the reſolution as his gift,) we would ſet about to perform and believe as we may, and when we cannot go, we would creep, when we cannot ſpeak words of Faith, we would let Faith breath; when it can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeak nor breath diſtinctly, we would let it pant: In a word, to be eſſaying the exerciſe of Faith, and often renewing our eſſays at it, which if we did, we ſhould come better ſpeed in Believing then we do; thus though ye were walking under a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, that ye would do no more at this then a Man whoſe Arm is withered can do, to ſtreatch it forth, yet as the Man with the withered Hand at Chriſt's word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand eſſayed to ſtreatch it forth and it went with him, or as the Diſciples when they had toiled long, even all the Night, and caught nothing, yet at Chriſt's word let down the Net and incloſed a multitude of Fiſhes; ſo, though ye have eſſayed to act Faith often, and yet come no ſpeed, yet eſſaying it again on Chriſt's calling to it, it may, and will through Grace go with you. 8. When yet ye come not ſpeed as ye would, your ſhort-coming would be bemoaned and complained of to God, laying open to, and before Him the Heart, who can change it; and ye would have it for a piece of your weight and burthen, that your Heart comes not ſo up to, and abides not ſo by Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I would think it a good Frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, when the not having of the Heart ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo fix'd at Believing, is an Exerciſe and a Burthen. 9. When all this is done, in ſome meaſure, ye would wait on in doing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152256:49"/> thus, and would continue in this way, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Him who is the Author and Finiſher of Faith, for His influence to make it go with you, to look to Him to be helped, is the way to be helped to Believe, or to Pray to Him to better and amend Faith, is the way to have it bettered and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it's ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.5. <hi>They looked to him and were lightened, and their faces were not aſhamed:</hi> And if it be ſaid, How can one look that ſees not? It's true, blind Folk cannot look, yet they may eſſay to look, and though there be but a glimmering, as the looking makes the faculty of Seeing the better and more ſtrong, ſo the Exerciſe of Faith makes Faith to encreaſe, this is it that the Pſalmiſt hath, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. <hi>v.</hi> laſt. <hi>Be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord;</hi> that is, if ye be weak, wait on and He ſhall ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you, Believe, and give not over, though to your Senſe ye come not ſpeed: Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that are looking conſcienciouſly to their way, though they have but a glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weak ſight of Chriſt, and be as the Man that at firſt ſaw M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We cloſe with this word of Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That as we ſpeak not of theſe things as being in Man's power to be performed, ſo neither can they be gone about to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but where there is ſome Faith and Love; yet when they are at firſt looked on, they are ſome way more within our reach then the diſtinct Exerciſe of Faith, which is a great Myſtery.

            <p>IF Folks ſoberly and gravely conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of what concerment it is to make uſe of the Goſpel, and what depends upon the profitable or unprofitable hearing of it, how ſerious would both Speakers and Hearers be? This ſame poor, mean and contemptible-like way of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Preaching, is the ordinary way that God hath choſen to ſave Souls, even by the <hi>fooliſhneſs of Preaching,</hi> as the Apoſtle hath it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. and where Miniſters have been tender, how near hath it lyen to their Hearts, whether People profited or not: They that will read <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> how he reſented and complained of it, and how he was weighted with it, will eaſily be induced to think that he was in earneſt, and that it was no little matter that made him thus cry out, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhew that four things were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the words. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the great Errand of Miniſters is, to bring the glad Tydings of Jeſus Chriſt the Saviour to Sinners. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is the great Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of People to believe and receive the Offer of Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is the great Sin of a People that Hear the Goſpel not to believe and receive Jeſus Chriſt when He is offered unto them. The <hi>fourth</hi> and laſt thing which now we are to ſpeak of, (having gone thorow the firſt three) is, That the great and heavy Complaint that a faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel hath, is, when theſe good News are not received and welcomed, when they have it to ſay, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> when it is but here one and there one that cloſes with Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:152256:49"/>
            <p>Conſidering theſe words, as they hold out the Prophets Reſentment and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, we ſhall from them draw four <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations</hi> which we ſhall ſpeak ſhortly to, and reſerve the Uſe and Application to the cloſe of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. The firſt is, That its meet for, and the Duty of a Miniſter of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to obſerve what Fruit and Succeſs his Miniſtry hath among a People, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they Believe or not; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks not here at random, but from conſideration of the Caſe of the People, and as obſerving what fruit his Miniſtry had among them; we would not have Miniſters too curious in this, as to the ſtate of particular Perſons, neitner would we have them ſelfy or anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ſeeking any ground of boaſting to themſelves, yet they would ſeek to be ſo far diſtinct and clear anent their ſpiritual Caſe and Condition, as they may know how to ſpeak ſuitably to it, and how to ſpeak of it to God; that they may ſay as they have ground for it, that in ſuch a Place, among ſuch a People, <hi>a great door and effectual was opened unto us,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.8. And in ſuch another Place, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch a People, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> as here the Prophet doeth. It's ſaid <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.17. and <hi>Mark</hi> 6.30. the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples returned, and with joy told Chriſt all that they had done, and how the Devils were ſubject to them, they made acccount what ſucceſs they had in their Miniſtry; ſo it's neceſſary that a Miniſter know what ſucceſs He hath among a People, that he may know, 1. How to carry before God in reference to them, what to Praiſe for, what to Lament for, and what to Pray for. 2. It's neceſſary as to the People, that he may carry right to them for the gaining of Strangers to God, and helping forward theſe who are entered into the Way, and that he may know what report to make of them. 3. It's neceſſary for a Miniſter himſelf, though no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſimply as to his Peace, for that depends on his faithful diſcharge of his Office, yet as to his Joy and Rejoycing, to know when he labours in vain, and when not, among a People.</p>
            <p>We would not then (as a paſſing word of <hi>Uſe.</hi>) have you to think it curiouſity, though ſomething be ſaid now and then, and aſked at you, that ſome of you may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly think impertinent; For it becomes a Phyſician to ſeek to know the ſtate and condition of theſe whom he hath under his Hand and Cure, and ye would not take it ill, though after obſervation, we now and then ſpeak and tell you, what we conceive to be your condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. The ſecond Obſervation is, That it is moſt ſad to a tender Miniſter, and will much affect him to ſee and obſerve Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and Unfruitfulneſs among the People that He hath preached the Goſpel to; This muſt be a certain and clear Truth, if we conſider what it was that put <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to this, even to cry, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> Though a Miniſter ſhould have never ſo great exerciſe of Gifts, never ſo much coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and reſpect among a People, if he be tender, he will be more grieved and weighted with their Unbelief and Unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs then with Stripes and Impriſonment, there will be no ſuffering to this in his eſteem, nothing ſo ſad a ground of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; This makes the Prophet, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.1. to cry, alace and <hi>wo is me, I am as theſe who have gathered the ſummer-fruits, as the grape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleanings after the vintage, there is no cluſter to eat, the good man is periſhed, and there is none upright among men,</hi> and he inſiſts in this Complaint. How often was our Lord Jeſus, the moſt excellent &amp; tender Preacher that ever preached, put to this Complaint? All the Affronts and Reproaches He met with, grieved Him not ſo much as the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and Hardneſs of Heart that were in the People; It's ſaid, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.5. that <hi>He look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round about on them with anger, and was grieved for the hardneſs of their hearts;</hi> And it's ſaid <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.6. that <hi>He marvelled becauſe of their unbelief;</hi> yea, it ſo affected Him, that (<hi>Luk.</hi> 19.42.) it's ſaid, that <hi>when He came near the city He wept over it, ſaying, O that thou hadst known in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace.</hi> There is a fourfold Reaſon of this, that hath a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Influence on the ſadning of a ſerious
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:152256:50"/> and tender Miniſter of the Goſpel. 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Chriſt Jeſus his Maſter, in whoſe ſtead he comes to beſpeak and woo Souls to Chriſt; What would an Ambaſſadour think of perſonal Reſpect and Honour, if his Maſter were reproached, and his Meſſage rejected and deſpiſed? and can an honeſt and faithfull Ambaſſadour of Chriſt look on, and his Heart not be wounded, to ſee the Goſpel Fruitleſs? the Lord's pleaſure as it were Marred, and the work of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering in of Souls, Obſtructed in his hand, and his Lord and Maſter Affronted and Slighted. 2. The Reſpect that a Faithful Miniſter hath to the Peoples Souls, hath influence on this; A tender Shepherd will watchfully care for, and wiſh the Sheep well, and be much affected when they are in an evil condition, and where the relation is of a more Spiritual nature, and the Flock off far, very far greater worth and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what wonder the Shepherd be more affected? as <hi>Paul</hi> beſpeaks the <hi>Galatians</hi> 4.19. <hi>My little children, of whom I travel again in birth till Christ be formed in you;</hi> To be travelling and bringing forth but Wind, cannot but prick and wound an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Miniſter of the Goſpel at the very Heart, ſo 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who is offended and I burn not?</hi> The very hazard of a Soul, will be like a Fire burning the Heart that is tender and zealous of the ſpiritual good of Souls. 3. The reſpect that a Faithful Miniſter hath to the Duty in his Hand, hath influence on this; for ſuch a one loves to neat his Duty, and to go neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lively about it, and the Unbelief and Unfruitfulneſs of the People clogs him in his Duty, and makes him drive heavily; hence it's ſaid <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.58. and <hi>Mark</hi> 6.5. that our Lord <hi>could not do many mighty works there,</hi> or among that People, <hi>becauſe of their unbelief;</hi> Unbelief ſtraitens and ſhuts the Door, and makes Preaching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a very Burthen to a Faithful Miniſter, therefore the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and watch for your ſouls, that they may do it with joy and not with grief, for that is unprofitable for you;</hi> A neceſſity lyes upon Miniſters to go about their Work, but when the Word does no more but buff on them, ſo to ſpeak, it makes them to cry as this ſame Prophet doeth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.11. <hi>How long Lord?</hi> And 4ly. This alſo hath influence on their being ſo much weighted, even the concern of honeſt Miniſters own Joy and Comfort; It is true, as we hinted before, that neither a Faithful Miniſter's Peace, nor his reward of Grace doeth depend on it ſimply, <hi>I have ſpent my ſtrength in vain,</hi> ſays <hi>Iſaiah, chap.</hi> 49.4. <hi>yet my labour is with the Lord, and my reward from my God;</hi> As to that, there is no neceſſary connection, and it's of Grace it is ſo; yet as to a Miniſter's Satisfaction and Joy there is a connection, as we may ſee <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.16. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That I may joy in the day of Chriſt, that I have not run in vain, and laboured in vain;</hi> And from his expoſtulation with the <hi>Galatians, chap.</hi> 4.9, 10, 11. <hi>I am affraid of you, lest I have beſtowed upon you labour in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not proſecute the <hi>Uſe</hi> of this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; only ſee here, that it is no marvel though ſometimes we be neceſſitate to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of you, and to expoſtulate with you; and conſidering the Caſe of People gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, if our Hearts were ſuitably tender, it would make us even burſt for Grief to ſee ſo many ſleeping ſecurely and ſenſleſly in their Sins, and in that pitiful poſture poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Pit, if God prevent not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3. The third Obſervation is, That a Miniſter may, and ſometimes will be put to it, to make report to God of what Fruit his Miniſtry hath, and ſometimes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to Him of the Unbelief and Unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the People among whom he hath long preached the Goſpel; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (ſure) is not carried to this Complaint out of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the People, neither from any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he hath in it, nor any delight to tell ill Tales (to ſpeak ſo) of them; The Lord needs no Information, yet he complains, and that to the Lord, as we ſhew from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16. where it is ſaid, <hi>Lord, Who hath believed our report?</hi> So then. Prophets and Apoſtles complain of this; It's <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Complaint no doubt to God, as it was the Lords to him, <hi>This people are a rebellious houſe, and they will not bear;</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks here in his own name and in name
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152256:50"/> of other Miniſters of the Goſpel, that they may joyn with him in this Complaint; and there is reaſon for it, if we conſider, 1. The Relation that a Miniſter ſtands in to God, He ought to give an account to Him, who gives Obedience and who not, and what Is done by his Embaſſage, there being no Talent given, but a Reckoning how it was imployed, will be called for. 2. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination that a Miniſter ſtands in to Chriſt, wherein it is requiſite he be keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as knowing the Work is the Lords and not his, pleads for this. 3. That a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter may be keeped from Carnalneſs and Vanity on the one hand, and from Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement on the other, he ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint with, and to hold up both the Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Unfruitfulneſs of the People to God. 4. It's meet for the Good of the People it be ſo, not to irritate, but kindly to affect the People, that when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains to God, they may be convinced that it is to get the Evil complained of amended, if ſo it may be.</p>
            <p>This complaining will we fear be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of much Preaching among you; for, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there muſt be more Faith and Fruits, elſe ye will have the moe Complainers, and the moe Complaints againſt you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 4. The fourth Obſervation is, That it is and ought to be a very ſad and weighty thing to a Miniſter, and alſo to a People, when he is put to complain to God of their Unbelief amongſt whom he is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring; It's the laſt thing he hath to do, and he can do no more, and it's the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and higheſt of Witneſs and Ditty againſt them, when a Miniſter hath been Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long, and obſerving the Fruit of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and is out-wearied with their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs, and forced to cry, Lord there are none, or but very few that have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Report that I have brought to them; It's the heavieſt and hardeſt word that Chriſt hath to ſay to <hi>Jeruſalem, Mat.</hi> 23.37. and <hi>Luke</hi> 19.31. when He complains of their Unfruitfulneſs, harder and heavier then all the Woes He pronounced againſt the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> or on other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and at leaſt equivalent to them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced on the ſame account; for the ſame Woe and Wrath follows both; O! ſaith He, <hi>that thou hadſt known in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace, but now they are hid from thine eyes;</hi> This comes as the laſt and ſadeſt word, holding out the deſperateneſs of their Condition, when the powerful preaching of the Goſpel hath no gracious Force, nor ſaving Effect following it, when Directions prevail not, when no ſort of Miniſterial Gifts do a People good, when it comes to that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.16. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſhall I liken this generation, it is like children ſitting in the market-place crying to their fellows, we have piped to you and ye have not danced, we have mourned to you and ye have not lamented;</hi> when both the ſweet Offers of Grace and the terrible Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Law, come forth to a People, and both are followed for a long time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fruit, then comes out that word, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſhall I liken this generation?</hi> John <hi>came neither eating nor drinking, and ye ſay he hath a devil;</hi> his auſtere way of Living and Preaching did you no good, ye could not away with it; <hi>The ſon of Man came eating and drinking,</hi> in a familiar way, <hi>and ye ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a man gluttenous, a wine-biber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners;</hi> They ſtumble on both unjuſtly, and ſo it is ſtill even to this day, many ſtumble at the Meſſenger, caſt at the Meſſage, and then followeth the ſad Complaint.</p>
            <p>It's meet that now we ſpeak to a word of <hi>Uſe,</hi> but we profeſs we know not well how to follow it, there is ſo much ground to Complain, and we are not (alace!) ſuitably ſenſible of our own unfitneſs to follow the Complaint, which makes us think that it would become another better; But what ſhall we ſay? It's the Word of the Lord, and it were needful that both ye and we ſhould forget and take our eyes off Man, and remember that it is the Lord God, and ſome commiſſioned from Him, that we have to do with, that ſo we may accept of the Meſſage. 1. Then, We may ſay that it is no pleaſure to us to be hewing you, and ſpeaking ſadly to you, (the Lord knows,) would to God there were moe that needed Healing-Medicines, and that fewer had need of Hewing and Wounding; but the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:152256:51"/> truth is, Carnal Security, Spiritual Pride, Hypocriſie and Formality, are ſo rife, and become ſo much the Plague of this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that People believe not their hazard. Neither 2ly. Is it our deſire nor deſign to ſpeak to all of you indifferently and without Diſcrimination, for as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.19. <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her children;</hi> Though the Generality deſpiſe this Word, yet we are confident the Lord hath ſome that He allows not to be grieved; and we ſhall deſire, that ſuch may not wrong them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves nor mar our freedom in ſpeaking the Word of the Lord to others. 3ly. We ſhall not deſire to ſpeak peremptorly as to the Caſe of particular Perſons, though we will not deny nor conceal our Fears and ſad Apprehenſions as to many of you; only what we have to ſay, ye would know and be aſſured that it is not ſpoken at random by us, but as having ſome acquaintance with many of your Conditions, and we may gather from theſe what is very probably the Condition of others.</p>
            <p>And now as to what we would ſay to you; Some have been preaching this Goſpel to you who are flitted and removed to another part of the Vineyard, other ſome are gone to another World, and ſome are yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Preaching to you, but what Fruit is brought forth by the Miniſtry of all? If we were put to make a report of you, as we will be put to it, what could we ſay? we are afraid to ſpeak our apprehenſions; O! how little is this Goſpel, as to it's Fruit and Succeſs, upon the growing hand among you? We ſhall therefore forbear to ſpeak of that which we think hath deep Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on our ſelves concerning you, but we would have you to look thorow Matters how they ſtand betwixt God and you, and if we may humbly lay claim to any meaſure of the judgement of Diſcerning; may we not aſk where is there a Man or a Woman amongſt moſt of us, that hath a Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuitable to this Goſpel? If we begin at the great Folks that have the things of the World in abundance, it's their work for moſt part not to be Religious, but to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and heap up Riches, and to have ſomewhat of a Name, or a piece of Credit in the World, this is the fartheſt that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ſuch deſign: And if we come and take a look of the way of the Poorer ſort, they live as if they were not called to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to Godlineſs; and this is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Generality, to live as if God were not to call them to a reckoning; ye will ſay, we are poor ignorant Folks, and are not Book-learned, but have ye not Souls to be ſaved? and is there any other way to be ſaved then that royal Way wherein Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have walked? But if we ſhould yet look a little further through you, how many are there that have not the very form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who never ſtudied to be Chriſtians, either in your fellowſhip with others, nor when alone, or in your Families; There are ſome, O! that I might not ſay, many, who are hearing me, that will not once in the Year bow their Knee to God in their Families, many of you ſpend your time in Tipling, Jeaſting, Looſe-ſpeaking, which are not convenient; yea, I dare ſay, there are many that ſpend more time in Tipling, Jeaſting, and Idle-ſpeaking, then in the Duties of Religion, either in publick or in private, what report ſhall we make of you? Shall we ſay that ſuch a man ſpent three or four Hours every day in going up and down the Streets, or in Tipling and Sporting, and would not ſpend half an Hour of the Day on God and His Worſhip; and further, how many are yet ignorant of the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion, a fault that is often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, and yet we would be aſhamed to have it heard of, that ſuch Ignorance ſhould be under half a Years preaching of the Goſpel, that is in this Place under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years preaching of it, and this not only among the Poorer ſort, but even amongſt thoſe who hold their Heads very high, and are above others, who can guide and govern their own Affairs, and give others a good counſel in things concerning the World, yet if we come to ſpeak with them of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or of Faith in its Exerciſe, of Convictions and Challenges for Sin, of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, of the working of God's Spirit in the Regenerate, or of the Fruits of the Spirit, they have not a Mouth to ſpeak a word of theſe things; and if they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152256:51"/> ſpeak any thing, O! but it looks werſh, taſteleſs, and thieveleſs like; Put them to diſcourſe of Religion, it hath no guſt, (to ſay ſo,) it reliſhes not, they have no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of it, at leaſt, that is experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental; doeth this look like Folks that have heard and received the Goſpel? let me ſay it, the Wiſdom of this World, and the Knowledge of Chriſt, are far different things; and if ſome of you go that length as to get the Queſtions of the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> which is well done in it ſelf; if we put you but to expreſs them in other words, ye cannot, which ſays plainly that ye are not Maſters of your Knowledge: And what ſhall we ſay of others? of whom we cannot ſay but we get reſpect enough from them, yet how do Selfiſhneſs and Worldly-mindedneſs abound in them? and how Graceleſs and Chriſtleſs are they found to be, when put to the tryal? We would alſo ſay to you, that there is great difference betwixt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and Chriſtianity; Fairfaſhions will never paſs in Chriſt's account for the ſuitable Fruits of the Goſpel, and will never hinder us from having a juſt ground of Complaint againſt you; How many have a Form of Religion, and want the Power of it? who think themſelves ſomething, when they are indeed nothing, and their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſo thin and holled, to ſpeak ſo, that their Rottenneſs and Hypocriſie may be ſeen thorow it. Though theſe things be but general, yet they will comprehend a great many of you that are here in this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; and if ſo, is there not juſt ground of Complaint of, and Expoſtulation with you, as a People among whom this Word hath no ſuitable Fruit: And as for you that live Prophanely and Hypocritically, what ſhall we ſay to you? or how ſhall we deal with you? we bring the Word to you, but ye make no more uſe of it then if ye had never heard it; no more Religion ſheweth it ſelf in you, then if ye lived among <hi>Heathens;</hi> Shall we ſay to God, the Fruit of the Goſpel is there? Dare we be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, or can we be faithful to you, to flatter you over, as if all were well with you? and muſt not our Complaint then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be this, <hi>Lord they have not believed our report;</hi> though we be feckleſs, and though there be ground of Complaint of us, yet the Word is His Word and will take hold of you. I know that Folks do not readily digeſt ſuch Doctrine well, and it may be ſome think that few Miniſters are better dealt with then we are; but we ſay, that that is not our Complaint; we confeſs if we look from the beginning of the World to this Time, there will be few Miniſters of the Goſpel, found to have been better dealt with as to outward and civil things, but alace! ſhould that ſtop our Mouth? yea rather ought it not to be the more ſad to us to be ſo dealt with, and to live in civil Love with Men and Women who yet do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Goſpel, nor deal kindly with our Maſter; Do not think that we will take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal reſpect to us for the Fruit of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; as we have no cauſe to complain of other things, ſo let us not be put to complain of this, but receive Chriſt in your Heart, let Him and His precious Wares have Change and go off amongſt you, make uſe of Him for Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption, and go not for the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the Means that ſhould bring you near Him, but be in good earneſt, and this would ſatisfie us much, and prevent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. Laſtly, I would aſk you what will come of it, if we ſhall go on in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ye in Hearing, and yet continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill in Unbelief? will there not be an account craved of us? and muſt we not make a report? and if ye think we muſt report, can we report any other way then it is with you? Shall we, or dare we ſay, that ſuch a Man was a fine civil Man, and that therefore he will not be reckoned with though he believed not in Chriſt? No, no, but this muſt be the report, that ſuch a Man, and ſuch a kind of Men, though Chriſt was long wooing them, would not embrace Him, though He invited them to the Wedding, yet they would not come, nay they mocked and ſpurned at it, they trode the Blood of the Covenant under Foot, and counted God a Liar in all His Offers, and ſaid by their Practice, that they ſhould be happy though they took not this way; many of you who would not take it well if we ſhould
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152256:52"/> ſpeak this to you in particular, will find it to be a Truth one day: And if ye ſhall ſay, What would we be at? The anſwer is at hand, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and ye ſhall be ſaved;</hi> This is the End of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and the mean of your Happineſs; it's the great and the main thing that we call for, which if it be not obtained, the ground of the Complaint will continue: And do you think this any ſtrange, hard, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth thing, that when we bring to you the Offer of Chriſt in the Goſpel, we bid you receive it, and flee in to Him to hide you from the Wrath to come; and yet this is all we ſeek of you; it's neither your Shame nor your Skaith that we ſeek, but that ye may take with your Sin, that ye may judge and condemn your ſelves, that your Mouth may be ſtopped before God, and that ye may flee to Jeſus Chriſt in earneſt, and cloſe with Him on His own Terms: As therefore ye would prevent the greatly aggravated Sin, to wit, ſinning againſt the Goſpel, and the Complaint of the Miniſters thereof againſt you, and the terrible Vengeance of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, <hi>Kiſs the Son,</hi> caſt open the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Doors of your Hearts, and let the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and Chriſt the King of Glory have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: We pray you ſtand not in the way of your own Happineſs, refuſe not to do Him that much pleaſure and ſatisfaction for all the travel of His Soul, as to give Him your Souls to be ſaved.

            <p>WE have ſpoken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what theſe days paſt, to ſundry Doctrines from this part of the Verſe, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the ſad Complaint which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hath in his own name, and in the name of all the Miniſters of the Goſpel, that the ſavoury Report concerning Jeſus Chriſt is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and that though Life and Salvation through Him be offered to many, yet there are but few, ſcarce here one and there one that do embrace it, this is the ſad reſult, <hi>Lord, who hath believed our report?</hi> Words, that being ſpoken by ſuch a Prophet, and ſo often mentioned in the New-Teſtament, may and ſhould as often as we ſpeak, hear, or re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Ere we leave this part of the Verſe, it will not be unmeet that we ſpeak a little to theſe three. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To what may be the Cauſes why, when the Goſpel is powerfully Preached, there are ſo few Believers. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> How it comes to paſs, ſeeing ſo few Believe, that generally ſo many think they Believe, and ſo few ſuſpect their own Faith. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To the neceſſity that lyes on the Hearers of the Goſpel, to enquire at, and try themſelves concerning their Faith, and to have ſome ſolid Satisfaction in it.</p>
            <p>Although we mention no particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines now, yet conſidering the Doctrines we ſpoke to before, theſe things will not be unſuitable to them, nor impertinent to you.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:152256:52"/>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> The Cauſes why ſo few believe the Goſpel, we cleared to you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, That generally the powerful Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel hath been with little Fruit, ſo that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hath this ſad Complaint, <hi>Lord, who hath believed our report?</hi> and our Lord Jeſus hath it alſo on the matter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.7. <hi>We have piped to you and ye have not danced, we have mourned to you and ye have not lamented,</hi> and in the ſame expreſs words, <hi>John</hi> 12.38. And when it is ſo with ſweet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the Old Teſtament, and with our bleſſed Lord in the New, that ſpoke with ſuch Power and Authority, ye may ſee there is reaſon for us to enquire into the Cauſes, why it is that ſo few Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? In ſpeaking to which. 1. We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to touch on all the Reaſons that may be gathered together, of Peoples not profiting under the Goſpel, but of theſe that ye have moſt reaſon to look to, and that are moſt obſtructive of Faith in you. 2. Though we might ſpeak of Reaſons on the ſide of them that ſpeak to you, for <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> and we ſhall not deny but we have culpable acceſſion to your Unfruitfulneſs, yet it were not much to your edifying to inſiſt on theſe. 3. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will we ſpeak to theſe ſoveraign Cauſes on God's part, who in His Holy Juſtice gives up People to Unfruitfulneſs, when they receive not the Truth in Love. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 4ly. Shall we inſiſt on theſe Cauſes that may ariſe from the Devil, who waits on wherever the Word is preached, to mar the Fruit of it, as we may ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19. the evil Spirits, like as many Crows, when the Seed of the Word is ſowen, waiting on to pick it up, and ye would know, that ye never come to hear the Word, but there are, as it were, Flocks of Devils attending you; Hence it is that ſome are rocked and lulled aſleep, ſome have their Minds filled with worldly Thoughts, ſome forget all that they Hear ere they go out of Doors, thus it is with many Hearers of this Goſpel, their Hearts are trode upon as the Way-ſide by Devils and Foul-Spirits, that never a word takes impreſſion on them, and though ye may think ſuch expreſſions uncouth-like and ſtrange, yet they are ſadly true; Satan waited on when Chriſt preached, and ſure he will ſcar no more to do ſo at our Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than he did at His, if he ſtood at <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi>'s right Hand to reſiſt him, he will no doubt be at ours; But we ſay we will not inſiſt on theſe. But 5ly. We ſhall ſpeak a little to theſe Cauſes that are common in you, which ye your ſelves m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ght know if ye would obſerve them, and we would exhort you to take notice of them, when we tell you of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then we offer, or rather aſſert this for a Cauſe, The want of ſerious mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great concernment of the work of your Salvation, and that this preached Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is the Word of the Lord by which ye muſt be ſaved; Alace! though ye have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, and though this Word be the mean of your Salvation, yet there are Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of you that never lay it to Heart, that your Souls are in hazard, and that this Word muſt be it that ye muſt live by, and live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I appeal to your Conſciences if ye think upon this ſeriouſly, want of this <hi>Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> foſters Security, breeds Lazineſs, and makes and keeps you Careleſs and Carnal; I ſhall inſtance the want of it in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. 1. Look how ye are affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this Word, and your own edification by it before ye come to hear it, How few are hungering and thirſting, or preparing for benefite by it, or preparing to meet with God in it? In effect ye come not with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to profite; ſo that if it were known, it would be wondred at, wherefore ye come to hear the Word, as Chriſt ſays of ſome, <hi>They came not becauſe they ſaw the miracles, but becauſe they did eat of the loaves and were filled;</hi> ſo may we ſay of you, that ye come not to profite by the Word, but on ſome crooked carnal deſign. 2. Look how ye carry when ye are come, How many ſleep a great part of the Sermon? ſo that it's a ſhame to look on the face of our Meetings, when in every corner ſome are Sleeping, whoſe Conſciences God will waken ere long, and the Timber and Stones of the Houſe will bear witneſs againſt them; Were you in any other Meeting, about ordinary Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there would not be ſuch Sleeping; But when ye are Waking, what is your Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage?
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:152256:53"/> for ye may be Waking, and your Heart far away, or faſt aſleep, how ſeldom can ye give account of what is ſaid? though your Bodies be preſent, your Hearts are wandering; ye are like theſe ſpoken of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. <hi>who ſat before the Prophet as God's people, but their hearts went after their covetouſneſs;</hi> how often while ye are ſitting here is your Heart away? ſome in their Thoughts running after their Trade, ſome after their Merchandice, ſome after one thing, ſome after another: This is one ſad inſtance of it, that there are many of you who have had Preaching fourty or fifty Years, that can ſcarce tell one Note of it all, and no wonder, for ye were not atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the Hearing of it. 3. Look how ye carry after the Word is heard; What un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying Diſcourſe will ye be engaged in ere ye be well at the Door? how carnally and careleſly do many ruſh unto, and go away from hearing of the Word? and when ye get a word that meets with your Souls Caſe, do ye go to your Knees with it before God, deſiring Him to breath on it, and to keep it warm? or do ye meditate upon it? Now put theſe three together, your Carriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the time, and after your Hearing the Word, ye will find that there is juſt cauſe to ſay, that the moſt part that hear this Goſpel are not ſerious, what wonder then that it do them no good? In the end of that Parable of the Sower, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>Mark</hi> 4. and <hi>Luke</hi> 8. its ſaid by the Lord, <hi>Take heed how ye hear, for whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given,</hi> &amp;c. If ye improve well your Hearing, ye will get yet more, but ſo long as ye take no heed how ye hear, ye cannot profite.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> Ground or Cauſe is this, That the moſt part of Hearers never come to look on this Word as the Word of God, they come never almoſt to have a Hiſtorical Faith of it, it's ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>He that comes to God muſt believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that ſeek Him diligently;</hi> But when Folk do not really believe that God is, what wonder they ſeek Him not, that they fear neither Judgment nor Hell, and that they ſtudy not Holineſs? they ſay in their Hearts they ſhall have Peace, though they walk in the imagination of their own Hearts, and that the way to Heaven is not ſo narrow as Miniſters ſay it is, that God will not condemn poor chriſtned Bodies, this is the language of many Hearts and of ſome Mouths; Need there any evidences of it be given? if ye believed that the way to Heaven is ſo ſtrait, and that Holineſs is ſo extenſive, could ye poſſibly with any ſeriouſneſs reflect on your Heart and Way and not be affrighted? But the truth is, this Word gets not leave to ſink in you as the Word of God, therefore ſayeth our Lord to His Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.44. <hi>Let theſe ſayings ſink into your ears;</hi> There are theſe things I fear ye do not Believe, and let me not be thought to take on me to judge your Conſciences, when there are ſo many <hi>that profeſs they know God, but in works they deny Him,</hi> as it is <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. when we ſee ſuch things in your Carriage, we know that there is a principle of Unbelief whence they ſpring. 1. There are many of you that really believe not there is a God, or that He is ſuch as His Word reveals Him to be, to wit, Holy, Juſt, Powerful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> elſe ye durſt not live at feed with Him, <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart there is not a God, they are corrupt,</hi> &amp;c. your practical Atheiſm and Prophanity ſay ye believe not there is a God. 2. Ye never believed the ill of your Nature, <hi>Do ye think</hi> (as <hi>James</hi> beſpeaks theſe he writes to, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.5.) <hi>that the Scripture ſaith in vain, the ſpirit that is in you luſts to envy?</hi> Ye do not think, that your Heart is deceitful and deſperatly wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? though we ſhould Preach never ſo much on this Subject, yet ye lay it not to Heart, ye take it not to you in particular. 3. We are afraid that many of you believe not a Judgment, and your particular and perſonal coming to it, nay there are among you, who are like to theſe <hi>Mockers</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>Peter</hi> in his ſecond <hi>Epiſtle, chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. who ſay, <hi>where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> And as there were in <hi>Paul</hi>'s days ſome th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t denied the Reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. ſo there are ſtill, who do it on the matter, at leaſt; Ye have the ſame corrupt Nature; We would think that we had prevailed to ſome purpoſe, if ye were brought really to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152256:53"/> believe that there is a God, Life to come, and a Day of Judgment; and if ye did ſo, ye would be more ſerious in Duty, and would come more Hungry and Thirſty to the Word. 4. The Mean and Mids of Salvation is not believed, to wit, That the way to Peace with God is Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and that there is no way to Heaven but the way of Holineſs; If all your thoughts were ſpoke out, it would be found that ye have another mids than Faith, and another way than that of Holineſs; And to make out this, we need go no further then to your Practice, we are ſure many of you live in Prophanity, and yet ye have all a hope of Heaven, and what ſays this? but that ye think not Faith and Holineſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but that ye may come to Heaven ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and this is an old Fault and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, it was in <hi>Moſes</hi> his days, for ſome are brought in (<hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19.) ſaying, <hi>I ſhall have peace though I walk in the imagination of my own heart, and add drunkenneſs to thirſt,</hi> though I tipple daily at my Four Hours, though I follow my Luſts and Pleaſures, and take my fouth and fill of the World, we cannot be all Saints, <hi>&amp;c. The Lord will not ſpare that man, but His anger and jealouſie ſhall ſmoke againſt him, and all the curſes that are written in this book ſhall ly upon him, and the Lord will blot out his name from under Heaven;</hi> and though this be not now believed, it ſhall be found verified; There are many when they come to Judgment, that will know to their coſt, the truth of many things they never believed before? as we find in that rich Man, who ſays to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Send ſome to tell my brethren, that they come not to this place of torment,</hi> it ſays as much, as that He in his life-time did not believe how terribly-tormenting a place Hell is, and it is even ſo ſtill; Though Men and Women have immortal Souls, yet they go on following their ſinful way, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not that any evil ſhall befall them, till God's Curſe and Vengeance overtake them.</p>
            <p>A <hi>third</hi> Ground or Cauſe is, That Folk never think themſelves in hazard, nor ſuffer their hazard to affect them, and therefore they ſeek not after the Remedy, hence the <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ws, Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> rejected Chriſt, why? they were righteous Perſons whole, and needed not the Phyſici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n; And thus it is with many of you, ye will take with it that ye are Sinners, but not with the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of your Nature, and this makes it, that when Life, and Reconciliation with God, are offered, we have almoſt none to accept of it, why ſo? ye are generally in your own opinion, good Friends with God already, none of you almoſt think that ye have hatred at God, and ſo ye careleſly and unconcernedly let the opportunity of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Peace with Him ſlip over, even like theſe <hi>Jews</hi> ſpoke of <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44, 45. who when Chriſt ſaid to them, <hi>Ye have the devil to your father,</hi> anſwered, <hi>he had a devil, and that God was their Father, that they were come of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and were not born of fornication;</hi> So it is with many of you, ye could never endure to even your ſelves to Hell, nor to take with it that ye were heirs of Wrath, as if ye had been born with other Natures then the ordinary Race of Mankind is, and this keeps ſo many of you that ye get no good of this Goſpel, for it ſeeks Sinners to pardon them, and Enemies to reconcile them, and till the Feud be once taken with, the Friendſhip will never be ſought after, nor will it find Merchants, though when once the Enmity is taken with, the Goſpel hath many ſweet, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and comfortable words to ſpeak to the Man afterwards.</p>
            <p>A <hi>fourth</hi> Ground is, The love of Money and of the World, which <hi>is the root of all ill,</hi> This is given as a main Cauſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. why the Word profites not, <hi>The ſeed is ſowen among thorns, and the thorns ſpring up and chock it, the cares of this life and the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of riches chocked the Word;</hi> This is not oppreſſion nor ſtealing, but entanglement with, and addictedneſs to the things of this preſent World, Folks allowing themſelves too much ſatisfaction in their Riches and Pelf, counting themſelves as if all were well if they have it, and grieved if they want it, as if there were nothing but that to make Happy, being wholly taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and leaving no room for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of their Souls, for Prayer and Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:152256:54"/> of God, nor for Challenges to work on them, they are ſo wholly taken up with their Callings and Buſineſs; for they lay it for a Ground that they muſt be rich, and then they give themſelves wholly to all things that may contribute to that end, and that chockes and ſuffocates the Word that it never comes up, that nothing comes to perfection, therefore Chriſt ſays, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.24. <hi>Take heed ye be not overcharged with ſurfetting and drunkenneſs, and cares of this life;</hi> I am afraid that many moe among you who are civil, and eſteemed vertuous and frugal, ſhall periſh in this Pit of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs, then ſhall periſh by Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, Gluttony, Fornication, or the like, and yet there is nothing more frequent in Scripture, then words ſpoken to ſcar Folk from Earthly-mindedneſs, <hi>How hard is it</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of Heaven?</hi> and ſuch a Man is he that is taken up with Riches, and places his Happineſs and Contentment in them, whether he have more or leſs of them; We ſpeak not this to foſter Idleneſs in any, but to preſs Moderation in the uſe of lawful things; Ye think it enough if we cannot charge you with Oppreſſion, Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Whoring, and the like, but this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel will charge you with the love of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and if it find the love of the World in you, the love of the Father will not be found in you; Doth not your experience tell you, that it's not an eaſie matter to be much taken up with the World, and to win at a ſuitable diſpoſition for Duties of Religion, and to be painful in them?</p>
            <p>A <hi>fifth</hi> Ground is, Folks little prizing of the Goſpel and the Benefites that come by it; They look not upon it as their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have Communion with God, they who are invited to the Marriage of the King's Son, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. will not come, and the reaſon is given, <hi>they made light of it,</hi> the Offer of the Goſpel hath no weight, it reliſhes not; If a Market of fine things at a cheap Rate were procla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>med, ye would all run to it, but ye delight not in the Word of God, ye prize not the Goſpel and the precious Wares that it expoſeth to ſale amongſt you: And to evidence and make out this, I would aſk you theſe few Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, And 1. I would aſk you how often, or rather how ſeldom have you ſitten down purpoſly and thanked God for ſending the Goſpel to you? ye have given thanks for your Dinner, but how often have ye given Him thanks that ye have the Goſpel Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-days, and Week-days? 2. How little do many of you wait on the Preaching of it? were there a Meſſage ſent to you but from ſome ordinary Man, let be from a great Man, ye would ſtraiten your ſelves and your Buſineſs too ſomewhat that ye might hear it, and yet it's a wonder to think how ſome in this Place, except on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, will hardly be ſeen in the Church from one end of the Year to the other. 3. Had ye any evident to draw of Houſe or Land, ye would ſeek to have it drawn very well and ſure, but many of you never ſought to have the evidents of Heaven made ſure; ye know, how interruptions of, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to remove the preached Goſpel from you, never troubled you; That buſineſs of the <hi>Tender</hi> gave a proof, that if ye might brook your eaſe and the things of the World, ye cared not what became of the Goſpel and of the Liberties of Chriſt's Kingdom among you; nay we may ſay, the Goſpel was never leſs ſet by, never more reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, deſpiſed, and trode upon, then in the time wherein we live, and who lays it to Heart? If it were well tried, there is more pains taken on ſeckleſs particulars in a Week, then ye take upon your Souls in a Year, and which may be ſpoken to the ſhame of ſome, more time taken up in Tipling, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Debauching, then in Prayer, or any other Religious Duty; And is not that an undenyable evidence that ye make light of the Goſpel? <hi>They made light of it, and went their ways,</hi> &amp;c. ſaying on the matter, care for yonder Invitation who wili, as for us, we have ſomewhat elſe to do.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſixth</hi> Ground or Cauſe, though poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it be not ſo rife, is a ſhifting of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Challenges, a quenching of any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun Exerciſe in the Conſcience; Some of you have been made ſometimes to tremble as <hi>Felix</hi> did, but ye ſhifted it, and put it off to another time, and went away to ſome
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:152256:54"/> Company or Recreation, that ſo ye might ſtifle it, and drive it out of your thoughts; Is there any of you, but in Sickneſs, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome other ſad Croſs, or at a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ye have had your own Convictions, Challenges, and Frights about your Souls eſtate? and yet ye have ſmothered, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and put them out again.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſeventh</hi> Ground or Cauſe (which is as large and comprehenſive as any,) is Folks reſting and ſitting down, before they have any ſolid Ground to reſt upon, taking a counterfite Work for a real one, like theſe ſpoken of <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7.16. of whom it's ſaid, <hi>They return, but not to the moſt High;</hi> Some attain to a ſort of out-ſide Reformation, and they trow that on that account they are well enough and in good terms with God, and when ſuch are called to return, they ſay as theſe do, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Wherein ſhall we return?</hi> they think they are returned, and that their Peace is made already; They cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be bidden Believe, or to lay a new Foundation, for they think it's laid alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: In a word, as <hi>Laodicea</hi> did, <hi>they think themſelves rich and encreaſed in goods,</hi> when yet <hi>they are poor, blind, miſerable, wretched and naked,</hi> but they know not, and ſo are well ſatisfied with themſelves as gracious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; reſting on theſe and the like Grounds, As 1. It may be they Pray and think ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that. 2. They think they have Faith enough, if they have a Hiſtorical Faith. 3. It may be they have had ſome reſolutions, and fits of a ſort of Tenderneſs, and theſe they reſt upon: We ſhall not inſiſt to ſhew the rottenneſs of theſe Props, but ſhall only ſay, it were in ſome reſpect good for many of you, that ye had never had the little pieces of Profeſſion ye have: There is a ſort of civil, legal, formal, fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhioned Men and Women among us, whoſe Converſation and Communication reliſhes to none but themſelves, and ſpeak the Word who will, they think that they are without the reach of it; I muſt ſay this ſad word, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There may be many other Cauſes, and we would not ſtint and limit you to theſe, but ſure theſe are Cauſes why this Goſpel profites not: We may add theſe few, 1. There are ſome that ſtumble at the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, ſome at the Meſſage; Some thought <hi>Chriſt</hi> a Friend of <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> and ſaid He had a Devil, and ſo they ſaid of <hi>John Baptist;</hi> There are ſome that can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide neither free nor fair Speaking, and they think it's not the Word but the Speaker that they offend at, but Prejudices againſt the Carriers of the Word have never done good, but much ill; and ye would guard againſt them. 2. Sometimes there is a ſtumbling at the Spiritual Truths of the Goſpel, and a ſort of new-fangleneſs in the Hearers of it that laſts not; <hi>John</hi>'s Hearers <hi>rejoiced in his light for a ſeaſon;</hi> ſomething of it alſo was in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Hearers, but they ſoon turned the Back on Him when He tells them of eating His Fleſh and drinking His Blood, and of the neceſſity of it, elſe they could have no Life in them; <hi>This</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is a hard ſaying and who can bear it?</hi> If we would conſider theſe things, we might ſee convincing Cauſes of our little Thriving, and they might alſo (through God's Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) be made uſe of for directions to Thriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and if we could once bring you to be ſingle and ſerious in Hearing, and ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Thrifty, in making uſe of every Sermon and Sabbath for edification, we had gained a great point of you.</p>

And do ye think that ſuch a Faith as that will abide the Tryal before God, that never did abide your own Tryal? It will doubtleſs be a ſore beguile to go off the World with ſuch an opinion of Faith, and to have the Door ſhut in your very Teeth; Alace! there will be no amending or bettering of your Condition after Death; The Day comes when many of you, if God graciouſly prevent not, ſhall curſe your ſelves that ever ye ſhould have been ſuch Fools as to have truſted your own Hearts, or to have taken up this opinion of your Faith without ground: We would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeriouſly recommend to you the putting of your Faith more frequently to the tryal, and that ye would often read and think on that place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the Faith, prove your own ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. O! do not think that a matter of ſuch concernment ſhould be left lying at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture and utter uncertainty, who loſeth, when ye are ſo palpably acceſſory to your own Ruine, by not endeavouring to put your ſelves to ſo much as a Tryal? Do not ſay here for excuſe, <hi>We have no more Grace then God gives us;</hi> when ye never endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be ſo much as at the form of the Duty, or to go the length ye might have gone in putting your ſelves to the Tryal; The deceit then, being deſperate and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable, if continued in, do not, for the Lord's ſake, after all that is ſaid to you, continue beguiling your ſelves.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> Reaſon is, Folks ſettling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on unſound evidences and principles of Peace that will not bear them thorow before God; I do not ſay that they have nothing to ſay in word for themſelves, but that all they have to ſay will be no ground to prove their Faith, or to bear it thorow before God that they do believe indeed; It will be found at the beſt to be but a lie, as it's ſaid of that Man, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.20. <hi>A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived heart hath turned him aſide, he feeds on aſhes, he cannot deliver his ſoul, nor ſay, is there not a lie in my right hand?</hi> He may have a ſeeming reaſon for his Faith, but it's no reaſon indeed: If many of you were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now to die, what reaſon have ye to prove your Believing by? ſome will ſay, God hath always been good, kind, and gracious to me, I was in many ſtraits and difficulties, and I prayed and got many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveries; Thus all the ground of thy Faith is but Temporal Favours or Deliveries, which is even as if <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould have made their receiving of Temporal Deliveries and their acknowledging of them, and having ſome ſort of Faith of them, to be ground enough to prove their receiving of Jeſus Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:152256:56"/>
            <p>A <hi>third</hi> Reaſon is, Folks giving an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Countenance to Ordinances, and their formal going about of them; They trow they have Faith, becauſe they keep the Church and are not open Contemners and Miſregarders of Ordinances as ſome others are, becauſe they Pray, Read, Hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It ſeems it was ſomething like this, that the perſwaſion of theſe ſpoken of <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.26. is built upon, <hi>Lord</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we have heard thee preach, and have eaten and drunken in thy preſence;</hi> It's not ſimply that they heard Chriſt Preach, for many heard Him Preach who ſtoned Him, but that when others ſtoned Him, they followed Him and were not openly Prophane, nor profeſſed Contemners of Him and of His Preaching, as theſe others were; ſuch like words fall ſometimes from your Mouths: Ye will poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſay, what would we have of you? ye are not Prophane, ye wait on Preaching, and live like your Neighbours, and ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your ſelves with that; Alace! this is a poor, yea, a doleful Fruit of Ordinances, and of your attendance on them; If there be more ſecurity, preſumption, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hazarding on the Wrath of God, and leſs taking with the Quarrel betwixt Him and you on that ground.</p>
            <p>A <hi>fourth</hi> Reaſon is, Folks Hope, even ſuch a Hope, that contrair to the nature of Hope, will make the moſt part of you aſhamed; Ye trow ye Believe, becauſe ye hope ye Believe, and that ye will get Mercy, becauſe ye think ye hope in God's Mercy, and ye will not let any thing light to the contrair, nor ſo much as think that ye may be deceived; The opinion that Folk have of obtaining Mercy, that is maintained without any ground but their vain hope, is the rifeſt, moſt unreaſonable, and prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial evil that is among the Profeſſors of this Goſpel; henc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A <hi>fifth</hi> Ground is, Folks ſpiritual and practical Ignorance of the Righteouſneſs of God, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaking, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. ſayeth, <hi>Being ignorant of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, they go about to eſtabliſh their own,</hi> &amp;c. that which I mean is, Folks being ignorant of their Natural Condition, of the Spiritualneſs of God's Law, what it requires, and of the way of Faith, and of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Believing, and the nature of it: It's from the ignorance of theſe three, to wit, of the Miſchief that is in them by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of the Spiritualneſs of the Law, and of the Spiritualneſs of Faith, and of the Exerciſe of it, that they ſleep on in Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and think they have Faith when they have it not; And though ſometimes they will ſay their Faith is weak, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be beaten from it, but that they Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and their Faith is up and down as their Security ſtands or falls: This the Apoſtle makes clear from his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. where before his Converſion he ſays, he was a living Man, but after his Converſion he begins to think himſelf no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

            <p>A <hi>ſixth</hi> Reaſon is, That Folk drink in ſome Carnal Principles that have no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand in the Word of God, and accordingly ſquare every thing that comes in their way. 1. They lay it for a Ground, that Folk ſhould never doubt of God's Mercy; we do not ſay that Folk ſhould doubt of God's being moſt real in His offer of Mercy to Sinners in the Goſpel, but from that it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that never one ſhould doubt of God's love to them, or of their coming to Heaven, whether they cloſe with the Offer or not; Are there not many whom God curſeth? and ſhould not theſe doubt? A ſecond Carnal Principle is, That there is no ſuch reality in the Threatnings of God as there is in His Promiſes, as if He were utterly averſe from executing a Threa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

That <hi>He is a God that will not clear the guilty;</hi> And hath not the Scripture ſaid, that <hi>it's but a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that are ſaved,</hi> but (as it were) here one and there one, and that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny damned for one that is ſaved; But know it of a certain, that He will make you one day vomit up theſe Principles, with exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite torment, when out of your own Mouth He will convince you of your Miſtake and Deluſion. 3. When Folks want many things, they ſupply all with an honeſt Mind; This ſupplies your want of Knowledge, your want of Faith and of Repentance, and of every thing whereof ye are ſaid to be ſhor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A <hi>ſeventh</hi> Reaſon is from the deceitfulneſs of our Heart, and the natural Corruption that ſticks to us; There is naturally in us, Pride and Self-conceit, we are diſpoſed and given to think any thing that is our own, though it be but a ſhew, is as good as others reality; to think our own Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, our own other Parts and Gifts to be as good as thoſe of any others, whoſoever they be; And with Pride there is joined Self-love, we dow not abide to think evil of our ſelves, or to ſuſpect our ſelves; Though this Self-love be indeed Self-hatred, and is but love to our Corruptions, and makes us that when we live in hatred of God, to think that we love Him, ſo that we cannot be induced to think that we love Him not, for we know that love to God is good, and we love our ſelves ſo well, that we cannot endure to think that we want it; hence it's ſaid of ſome in the laſt Times, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>That they ſhall he covetous, proud, boaſters, blaſphemers, diſobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>having a form of godlineſs, and denying the power of it,</hi> and the foun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now when all theſe are put together, you may ſee how many Grounds Folks have to go wrong up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Men having Hearts diſpoſing and inclining them to go wrong, and little pains being taken to diſcover the deceit of them, is it any wonder that they think they Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, when indeed they Believe not, and be empty and toom-handed, having little or nothing to reſt upon, while they think they are Rich and want nothing; Theſe are not fancied and far fetched things but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, and at Hand, and may eaſily be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from your daily Practice; In all

            <p>And this is the laſt <hi>Uſe,</hi> which we cannot now inſiſt on, That ſeeing ſo many think they Believe who Believe not, and that there are but few that believe the Report, and indeed reſt on Chriſt for their Salvation, as He is offered to them in the Goſpel, it is of your concernment to endeavour to put your ſelves without the reach of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and to make it ſure that ye have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and received the Report; Is there any thing of concernment if this be not? even to mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Is there not a Day coming wherein ye will all be tried, whether your alledged Faith was true Faith, or but Preſumption? and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Conſcience which is now quiet, and which it may be never keeped you from an hours Sleep, ſhall awake and put forth its Sting, and ſhall bite and gnaw, and ye who ſhall continue under the power of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, will be put to gnaw your Tongues for pain and horrour under the gnawings of your Conſcience; Ye that never knew all along your life what theſe things mean'd, had need to ſtand the more in awe, and to be affraid when ye come near Death. Though it be a ſad matter, that when we ſhould be Preaching, and would fain preach the Doctrine of Faith, it ſhould, by reaſon of your Deluſion, be the great part of our work to be thus digging you out of your Preſumption, and overturning your carnal and ill-grounded Hope; yet we have the greater confidence and the more peace, to ſpeak to, and inſiſt in theſe Truths, becauſe they ly ſo near to the great deſign of the Goſpel, and to your immortal Souls Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and though we were able to preach more plauſible and ſweet things to you, yet if theſe Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> For ſtirring you up to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt by Faith, 1. Conſider if there be not a ſtanding Quarrel and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traverſie betwixt God and you for Sin; and if there be, as no doubt there is, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how that Contraverſie is to be removed, is there any other poſſible way but by Faith in Chriſt? If we were Preaching to ſuch as had never ſinned, and were never under the hazard of the. Wrath of God, there might poſſibly be a difficulty to perſwade to a receiving of Chriſt; But when ye have all this in your Conſcience, that there is Sin,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:152256:59"/> and a Curſe following Sin, and that there is no other way for removing that Curſe but by Jeſus Chriſt, is there not reaſon to expect that ye ſhould receive this Truth? will any of you think to ſtand and bide it out againſt God? and if not, then there is ſure a neceſſity of Believing in Jeſus Chriſt, or of lying under the Wrath of God for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider that this Goſpel and Word of Salvation is preached to you in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; When we ſpeak of Salvation, we do not ſay, that Chriſt was once preached to the <hi>Jews,</hi> or that in ſuch a far-off Nation there is a door opened for Salvation in the Goſpel; but we would turn over the words of the Apoſtle (<hi>Acts</hi> 13.38.) to you, and ſay to you in his words, <hi>Be it known to you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man</hi> (to wit Jeſus Chriſt,) <hi>is preached to you remiſſion of ſins,</hi> &amp;c. and this brings the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel near you, even to your door; it lays before you the way of acceſs to God by Chriſt, and puts it ſo cloſs and home to you, that Chriſt muſt either have a refuſal, or a welcome from you: The firſt conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of your own Sinfulneſs and Miſery might put you to ſeek after a Saviour, though he were at a great diſtance, but this other brings Him to your Heart and Mouth; and is it fit (think ye) to neglect ſuch a fair oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion? and will it be wiſdom, when Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation follows you, and crys after you, and Wiſdom lifts up its voice in the Streets, ſaying, <hi>O ye ſimple ones, how long will ye love foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. Conſider what will come of this if ye do not believe the Goſpel; Know ye not that many periſh that hear the Goſpel, and that upon this ſame very ground, that they did not receive Chriſt and Salvation through Him offered to them therein, and whereof they are now deprived? Are there not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this day curſing in Hell, under the Wrath of God, that they let ſlip and paſſed over ſo many golden Opportunities of the Goſpel without improvement? and know ye not that it will come to the ſame ſad paſs with you, if ye do not receive it? Do Men live always? Is there not an appointed time for all Men upon Earth? If before we have ſavingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed Faith on Him for making Peace with God, we be drawn to a reckoning before His Tribunal, what will come of it? and are not our precious Opportunites apace and always ſliping by? and is not the work of Faith by delays ſtill the more difficult? are not our Bonds ſtill the more ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? and doth not our Indiſpoſition ſtill grow the greater? and is it not very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to ſee theſe who have ſlighted the work of Faith in their Youth. to live ſtupid in their old Age, and die Senſleſs?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider what ſort of Folk they are, of whom the Scripture ſpeaks as Unbelievers, and whom the Word of God holds forth to be eternally ſecluded from the preſence of God for the want of Faith; Many think that it's but the groſly Prophane, or ſuch as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had ſo much as the form of Religion, and ſuch as others would ſcunner and loath to hear them but mentioned, that it's (I ſay) only ſuch that are accounted Unbelievers; But the Scripture ſpeaks of ſome <hi>that ſeek to enter in and ſhall not be able;</hi> that deſire to be in Heaven, and take ſome pains to win in, and yet are never admitted to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and what is the reaſon, becauſe they took not the way of Believing for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Life and coming to Heaven; they took the way of Works, they took the way of Prayer, of Purpoſes, Promiſes and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to ammend and grow better, quite overlooking Chriſt and the way of Believing in Him, and ſo took the way of Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and promiſed themſelves Peace when there was no true Peace, nor any ſolid ground for it.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:152256:59"/>5. Conſider (which is of affinity with the former Conſideration) them that are ſecluded from the preſence of God for the want of Faith, they are even Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as we are, that lived in the ſame King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and City with us, that prayed in the ſame Company with us, that thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſure of Heaven as many of us do, that were guilty of the ſame or like Sins, that we are guilty of, that have heard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſame Preachings that we have heard, and yet they periſh for want of Faith, for not believing in the Son of God; Why then ſhould we think that impoſſible as to us, that is ſo common and frequent in others? Is not the ſame Nature in us that's in others, and are not our Hearts naturally as deceitful and corrupt as thoſe of others? and ſo may not we be beguiled as well as others? And is it not the ſame rule that He will walk by in judging of us, that He walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by in judging of others? What can be the reaſon, that Folk will read and hear the Word, and will promiſe to themſelves Heaven, when the ſame Word clears it plainly, that Deſtruction is that which they have to look for from the Lord: It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but this confident and proud Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that many take for Faith. Let not your precious opportunities ſlip away, and beguile not your ſelves in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning matter as Faith is; ye will never get this loſs made up afterwards if ye miſs Faith here.</p>

It cannot be; Suppoſe ye ſhould mourn all your Life-time, and your Life were a pattern to others, yet if ye want this one thing, Faith in Chriſt, ye will be found Tranſgreſſours, as having neglected the main work.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Question,</hi> ye will ſay, What this is we are bidding you do when we bid you Believe? <hi>Anſw.</hi> When we call you to Believe, we call you, 1. To be ſuitably affected with the ſenſe of your own Naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, Sinfulneſs, and H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d; Till there be ſomething of this Faith in our Lord Jeſus hath no acceſs, nor will ever get welcome; Deep apprehenſions of the Wrath that is coming, and a ſtanding in awe at the thoughts of our appearing before Him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much to it; I am not preaching De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation to you, as ſome mutter, but we would preſs upon you the Faith of the Word of God, that tells you what we are, and livelineſs under that impreſſion, that ye may not be ſtopped or letted till ye come to a thorow cloſure with Chriſt; The moſt part of Hearers come never this length, and this is the reaſon why many ſtumble in the very Threſhold, and make never Progreſs. 2. We call for and commend this to you, that ye would ſtudy to be through and clear as to the Uſefulneſs and Excellency of Jeſus Chriſt, as to the efficacy of His Death, as to the terms of the Covenant of Grace, whereby a Sinner comes to obtain Right to Him; to be ſenſible of Sin and Hazard without this, is only the way to make a Man deſperate and mad, but when this is clear, it makes an open door to the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that he may ſee whither to run from the Wrath to come; I do not only mean that ye would get the Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>chiſm, and be able to anſwer to all the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions concerning the Fundamentals of Religion contained therein, but that ye would alſo and mainly ſeek to have the Faith of theſe things in your H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arts, and to have Faith in God, that ye may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that He that was, and is God, died for Sinners, and that by the application of His Satisfaction, Sinners may obtain Life, and that there is a ſufficient Warrand given
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:152256:60"/> to a Sinner to hazard himſelf upon Him. The firſt of theſe ſpeaks the neceſſity of ſome Senſe, the ſecond holds out the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a general Faith, according to that word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>He that comes to God, muſt believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek Him;</hi> We muſt know that there is a Warrand to come, and ground to expect Acceptance from God upon our coming, or elſe we will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to, nor believe in Chriſt. The third thing that we call you to, when we call you to Believe, is, That the Sinner would actually ſtretch out that Faith, as the Souls Hand for the receiving of Chriſt, and for the Application of Him to himſelf, and would actually caſt himſelf upon the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Jeſus Chriſt for covering that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs that is in him, and would catch hold of, and grip to Him that is an able Saviour, for keeping the Sinner from ſinking under the weight of Sin that he lieth under; This is the Exerciſe and Practice of Faith when it flows from the general Doctrine of the neceſſity of believing ſuch things to be Truths in themſelves, and when it's extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and put forth in Practice, that we who are ſo certainly and ſenſibly loſt, muſt needs ſhare of that Salvation which we believe to be in Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo for that, roll our ſelves on Him; The firſt piece of Senſe may be in a Reprobate, the ſecond piece of Faith, that there is a ſufficient Salvation in Chriſt to be gotten by them that believe in Him, may be in a Devil; But this third of actual uſe-making of the Satisfaction of Chriſt, for paying our Debt, and rolling our ſelves upon Him, that's the Faith and Exerciſe of it that is peculiar to a ſound Believer, and the very thing that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes a Believer, and it is that which we commend to you, that ye may not ſtand and pleaſe your ſelves with looking only upon Chriſt, but that ye may caſt and roll your ſelves over upon Him, that Chriſt may get your Weight, and that all your Burthens and Wants may be upon Him, which to do ye muſt be enabled by the mighty Power of Grace, whereof in the next part of the Verſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Branch of the <hi>Uſe</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows upon this, is, That we would deſire you not only to follow this way of making your Peace with God, but to follow the trying and proving of it to your own ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that ye may be warrantably confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that it is ſo: There is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt theſe, to believe in Chriſt, and to be clear and certain that we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Him; As there is a neceſſity of the firſt, without which there cannot be Peace with God, ſo there is a neceſſity of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, though not ſimply, as without which there can be no Peace with God, yet upon this account, as without which we cannot be ſo comforted in God; And ſeing there are ſo many who do not Believe, who yet think themſelves to be Believers, and ſeing there is nothing more common among the Hearers of the Goſpel, then to reject Chriſt offered in it, and to Miſbelieve, and yet nothing more common then to be confident that they do Believe; There is good ground here to exhort you to put your Faith to the Touch-ſtone, that ye may know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye can abide the Trial, and whether ye may confidently aſſert your own Faith upon good ground, and abide by it: We would think if it were remembred, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſidered, how great a ſcarcety there is of Believers, and how rare a thing it is to get any to receive Chriſt, that Folk needed not be much preſſed to put their Faith to the Trial; and when there will not be one among many found who will paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the account of a real Believer with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſhould not the moſt part ſuſpect themſelves, ſeing the moſt part that hear the Goſpel are the object of this Complaint, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> or very few have believed it; ye would ſtudy to have ſome well grounded confidence in this, that ye are not gueſſing and preſuming, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon grounds that will fail you at laſt, but that ye be in caſe to ſay on ſolid grounds with the Apoſtle, <hi>I know whom I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> &amp;c. There is a Faith and Hope that will make many aſhamed; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the day of Judgment, when Chriſt ſhall have to do with theſe Perſons, that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:152256:60"/> never once thought to be thruſt away from Him, they of all Men ſhall be thruſt away from Him with greateſt Shame; O! the confuſion that will fill and overwhelm them who had a profeſſion of Chriſt, and yet had never the root of the matter in them above and beyond many others: Dare many of you, upon the confidence ye have, look Death in the Face? It's no great matter to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the time of Health; but will ye then be able to comfort your ſelves in the Promiſes of God? do not promiſe to your ſelves the things in the Covenant, except ye be endeavouring in God's way to be ſure ye are Believers indeed. Our Life depends upon our Faith, but our Conſolation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends much upon our clearneſs that we have Faith, and that we are in Chriſt, and therefore there is much need to preſs this upon you; There is no way to rid you of the Terrours of God, and to make you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably ſure of your particular Intereſt in the Promiſes of God, but by making it ſure and clear that ye are Believers in Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p>There are three or four ſorts of People to whom we would ſpeak a little here. 1. There are ſome who think that if they could do other Duties, though they ſhould never do this, to wit, to make their Calling and Election ſure, they would be and do well enough; Are there not many of you that never ſo much as ſet your ſelves to try whether your Faith would abide God's tryal or not? Ah! Ah! an atheiſtical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, a ſlighting of the Conſolations of God, aboundeth amongſt many, ſo that they think the Promiſes and the Conſolation that is to be gotten in the Promiſes, are not of ſo much worth, as to be thereby put to take pains to try and ſee whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them or not; but the Day will come that many of you will curſe your ſelves for your neglecting and ſlighting of this. A ſecond ſort are theſe, who becauſe they were never ſure of Peace with God themſelves, and becauſe they were never ſure of their own Faith, neither ever concernedly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be, they think it's all but fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that's ſpoken of aſſurance of Faith, and of Peace with God, they think it's but gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing at the beſt; There is ſuch a ſort of Perſons, who think they may be doing as they dow, and need not trouble themſelves with ſuch fancies or nice things, but if ye aſk them what will come of them at laſt? they will tell you, they will lippen that to God: Think ye it for nought that God hath laid ſo many Commands on you to make your Calling and Election ſure? and think ye it for nought that He hath given ſo many Marks to try it by? and that ſome of the People of God do holily and humbly glory and boaſt ſo much of their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God out of their aſſurance of His love to them, and of their ſpecial intereſt in Him? do not all theſe ſay that there is ſuch a thing as this to be had? There is a third ſort that pleaſe themſelves with meer conjectures about this Matter, and the greater their Security be, they perſwade themſelves the more that they have Faith; This is as ſad as any of the former, when they grant all, that Folks ſhould make their Calling and Election ſure, and ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be ſure of their Faith, but in the mean time take Peace with the Devil, and Peace with their Luſts for Peace with God, and a Covenant with Hell and Death, for a real Bargain with God: This is as true as this Word of God is, that there are many that put by all Challenges by this, and never ſuſpect their Faith, they hope that all ſhall be well, and they muſt always Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; as if that were the whole Duty of Faith to keep down all Challenges. A fourth ſort is, even of the generation of them that have ſome thing of God in them, who ſcar in a manner to make all ſure, and think it is a piece of Humility. and of holy and tender walking to maintain Doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing, even as others think it Faith to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tain Preſumption; They are always complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as if all things were wrong, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing right in their Caſe and ſo foſter and cheriſh Miſbelief; There is ſuch a thing as this, that marreth even ſerious Souls in their endeavours to make their Calling and Election ſure, and as long as this is, they cannot win to the ſuitable diſcovery of this excellent Grace that God calls them to Exerciſe, even <hi>Faith</hi> in the Lord Jeſus:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:152256:61"/> Need we make uſe of Motives to preſs you to this tryal of your Faith, and to this giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all diligence to make it ſure, who have eſpecially hitherto neglected it? If ye knew any thing of the vexation that Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief hath with it, and what horrour in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from the ſenſe of diſtance from God were, ye would think it a great matter to be clear in this thing; and if it were known and believed how this deluſion and unſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erneſs of Faith deſtroys the moſt part of Men in the World, even of the viſible Church; Durſt Men ly in their Security as moſt do, without all endeavours to make it ſure on good ground, that they do indeed Believe? Durſt they ly ſtill under God's Curſe, if they thought themſelves to be really under it, and did not fooliſhly fancy that it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with them? Durſt Men treaſure up Wrath to themſelves, if they thought not that the Hope they had were good enough? O! but Preſumption beguiles and deſtroys many Souls; and particularly this ſame Preſumption of Folks thinking themſelves right when they are wrong, hath deſtroyed, and doeth deſtroy, and will deſtroy moe Members of the viſible Church, then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanity, Drunkenneſs, Whoredom, Theft, Deſperation, or any other of theſe groſs, and much abhorred Evils do; This is the thing that locks Folk up in their Sin, even their Preſumption, when they ſay on the matter, <hi>We ſhall have peace though we walk in the imagination of our own heart?</hi> It's this that makes Men without fear, Steal, and Lie, and commit Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they ſay, <hi>Is not the Lord among us?</hi> Is not this the thing that keeps many of you that ye never tremble at the Word of God? we have Faith in God (ſay ye,) we lippen and truſt in Him; therefore ſeing Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo rife, have ye not need to try your Faith? If there were ſo much counterfeit Money in the Countrey, that it were a rare thing to get one good and upright piece of Money, ye would think your ſelves great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned and obliged to try it well, leſt ye were cheated with baſe and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Coyn; Is there not need then, yea infinitely much more need for them that would be ſo wiſe as not to be beguiled about the ſalvation of their Souls, to ſearch and try whether their Faith will abide God's tryal or not?</p>
            <p>Ye will readily move this <hi>Queſtion,</hi> What then are the Characters or Evidences of a ſolid and ſicker Faith that will abide the tryal, by which the pretended. Faith that is among the Men of this Generation may be examined and put to juſt tryal?</p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt name ſome direct Scriptures holding out ſomethings eſſentially accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying Faith, and then ſhall add others having more condeſcending Characters for the more particular differencing of this, helping to the deciſion of this great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>The firſt Mark whereby ye may try your Faith is, The ground and riſe of it, or that whereby it is begotten and cheriſhed; <hi>Faith comes</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>by hearing;</hi> Doctrinal Faith comes by the preaching of the Goſpel, and Saving Faith is wrought inſtrumentally by the ſame Word of God, it being <hi>the power of God to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> it being this Word that is the very ground of our Faith; I would aſk you where from your Faith comes, and what hand the Word of God hath in it? There are many that have a ſort of Faith not only without, but contrary to the Word of God, whereby they believe that they will get Heaven, while in the mean time the Word of God does directly exclude them, Get ye your Faith maintained without ever know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſity of a Promiſe for that effect? Can ye maintain your Peace and not have ſo much as any foundation in the truth and faithfulneſs of God to build it upon? Love never that Faith that hungers not after the Word, that is ſuppoſed to be lively without being ever fed by the Word, that cannot claim either its riſe and original, or its growth from the Word; I will not ſay from this or that word in particular, or at this or that time read or heard, but from the Word of God; the Word is the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation that Faith builds upon: If we look to what either accompanieth or followeth Faith, there are ſome plain Scriptures that will make that clear, as <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. <hi>and put no difference between us and them purifying
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:152256:61"/> their hearts by faith,</hi> (there was indeed once a great difference between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but now when he hath brought both to believe in Chriſt, the difference is removed,) There is an efficacy in it to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe the Heart, to purifie it, and to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Luſts out of it, for it cloſes and unites with Chriſt, and ſo brings him home to dwell in the Heart, and where Chriſt dwells He commands, and ſo whatever op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Him is baniſhed; Faith gives Chriſt welcome, and will give nothing welcome to dwell with Him that's oppoſite and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to Him, Faith improves Chriſt for the ſubduing of its Luſts and mortifying its Corruptions; whereas before there might be an fair outſide of a Profeſſion, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing clean outwardly, and much filthineſs and rottenneſs within, but when Faith is exerciſed on Chriſt, it purifies from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of the Spirit as well as of the Fleſh, it applys the Promiſes for that end, even to get the inſide made clean as well as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; yea, its main work is, to have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, the Heart purified, that being the fountain of all the pollution that defiles the Man, and brings the other neceſſarily along with it; never love that Faith that leaves the Heart as a Swines-ſty to Luſts, that leaves it ſwarming with unclean and vain Thoughts, or that leaves the Heart juſt as it was before; or that Faith that only cleanſeth the outſide and does no more; ſuch a Faith, however eſteemed by the Man, will never be accounted for true Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith before God; I do not, I dare not ſay that Believers will always diſcern this heart-purity or cleanneſs; but this I ſay, that true Faith will ſet the Man a work to purify the Heart, and will be making uſe of Chriſt for that end, not only to have the arm of the dominion of Sin broken, but to have the Soul more and more delivered from the indwelling power of it, and this will the deſign that he will ſincerely drive, to get the Heart purified within as well as the outward Man; inward Heart-abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be grievous and burdenſome to him as well as ſcandalous out-breakings.</p>
            <p>A ſecond place is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20, 21. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, nevertheleſs I live, yet not I but Chriſt liveth in me, and the life,</hi> &amp;c If ye would know a Companion of true Faith here is one, it hath a life of Faith with it; There is one life killed, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life is quickened, the life that is killed is that whereby the Man ſometime lived to the Law, <hi>I am dead to the Law</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle,) a Man's good conceit of himſelf, that once he had is killed and taken away, he wonders how it came that he thought himſelf Holy, or a Believer, or how he could promiſe to himſelf Heaven in the condition he was in; There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life comes in the place of that, and it's a life that is quickened and maintained by, and from nothing in the Man himſelf, but it's wholly from and by Chriſt; The Believer hath his holineſs and ſtrength for doing all called for Duties, and his comfort alſo from Chriſt. and he holds withall his very Natural Life, his preſent Being in the World from Chriſt. his all is in Chriſt; his ſtock of life, ſtrength and furniture is not in himſelf, but he lives by a continual Traffick, as it were on Bills of Exchange betwixt Chriſt and him; when he wants, he ſends a Bill to Chriſt, and it's anſwered in every thing that he ſtands in need of, and that is good for him; He is a dead Man, and he is a living Man, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever true Faith is, there the Man is dead and there the Man is living; Do not I pray miſtake it, by thinking that true Faith is but vented, puts forth it ſelf only in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this or that particular, or at this or that particular time only, for F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ith muſt be exerciſed not only at ſtarts, as when when we are under Challenges for Sin, or at Prayer, but we muſt deſign and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to exerciſe Faith thorow all our Life; that is, we muſt by Faith look for every thing that is uſeful and needful for us from Chriſt, and be always endeavouring to drive on a common Trade of living this way; we muſt be habituating our ſelves to ſeek after Peace, Strength and Conſolation, and what elſe we need, out of the fulneſs that is in Him; This Life of Faith is to ſee the want of all things in our ſelves, and yet to have all things by making uſe of Chriſt in all things; contenting and comforting our
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152256:62"/> ſelves that there is Strength in Him though we be weak in our ſelves, and that He hath gotten the victory over all His and our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and that we ſhall at laſt through Him, be victorious in our own Perſons, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſatisfying our ſelves that He hath compleat Righteouſneſs, though we be Bankrupt and have none of our own, and betaking our ſelves allenarly to that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for our Juſtification before God; Thus making a Life to our ſelves in Him, He living in us by His Spirit, and we living in Him by Faith? O ſweet and deſirable but myſteriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Life!</p>
            <p>The third place is <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus, neither circumſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith that worketh by love;</hi> He doth not ſimply ſay Faith, <hi>but faith that works by love;</hi> for Faith is an operative Grace, and this is the main vent of it, the thing by which it works, it works by Love; Faith is the hand of the new Creature, whereby every thing is wrought, it having Life from Chriſt, and we may ſay that Love is in a manner the hand of Faith, or rather like the fingers upon the hand of Faith, whereby it handleth every thing tenderly, even out of love to God in Chriſt, and to others for His ſake; Faith works, and it works by Love; that's a ſound and good Faith that warms the Heart with love to Chriſt, and the nearer that Faith brings the Believer to Him, it warms the Heart with more love to others; And therefore love to the People of God is given as an evidence of one that is born of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1. becauſe, wherever true Faith is, there cannot but be love to the Children of God flowing from love to Him that begets them; That Faith that's not affected with God's diſhonour out of love to Him, and that can endure to look upon the Difficulties, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Afflictions of the Children of God, without ſympathizing and being kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected therewith, is not to be taken for a ſound Faith, but to be ſuſpected for a Counterfeit.</p>
            <p>The fourth place is <hi>James</hi> 2 14. <hi>Shew me thy ſaith by thy works,</hi> &amp;c. True Faith hath always ſound Holineſs with it, in all manner of Converſation in the deſign and endeavour of the Believer, which is withall through Grace in ſome meaſure attained; What avails it for a Man to ſay that he loves another, when being naked or deſtitute, he bid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> him depart in Peace, be warmed, be filled, and yet in the mean time gives him nothing that he ſtands in need of, would not ſuch a poor Man think himſelf but mocked? Even ſo, will not God reckon you to be but Mock-believers, or Mockers of Faith when ye profeſs your ſelves to be Believers in Chriſt, while in the mean time ye have neither indeed Heart-purity, nor Holineſs in your outſide Converſation? that is but ſuch a Faith as Devils may have that will never do you good: Ye would believe this for a truth, that there will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Faith paſs for Faith in God's account, and ſo there ſhould never a Faith paſs for Faith in your account, but that Faith that ſets the Man a work to the ſtudy of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that Faith that works by Love, that Faith that purifies the Heart, and that Faith that puts the Perſon in whom it is, to ſtudy to have Chriſt living in him, and himſelf living in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I promiſed to name a few Scriptures that ſpeak out ſome more condeſcending Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Faith. And 1. I would think it a good token of Faith, to have Folk feared for miſſing and falling ſhort of the Promiſes, which may be gathered from <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. that ſtout confidence that thinks it's impoſſible to miſs the Promiſes, is a ſuſpect and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Faith, not to be loved; it's a much better Faith that fears, then that Faith that's more ſtout, except there be a ſweet mixture of holy ſtoutneſs and fear toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; It's ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. that <hi>by Faith</hi> Noah <hi>being moved with fear, prepared an Ark,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Noah</hi> had the Faith of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he ſhould be keeped free from being drowned by the Deluge with the reſt of the World, and yet he was mourning and trembling in preparing the Ark; If there were much Faith among you, it would make many of you more holily feared then ye are; Love not that Faith the worſe that ye never hear a threatning but ye tremble at it, and are touched by it in the quick. 2. It's a good token of Saving Faith, when
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:152256:62"/> it hath a diſcovery and holy ſuſpition of Unbelief wairing on it, ſo that the Perſon dare not ſo lippen and truſt his own Faith, as not to dread Unbelief, and to tell Chriſt of it; There is a poor Man that comes to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.23, 24. to whom the Lord faith, <hi>If thou canst believe,</hi> or canſt thou believe? yes Lord (ſays he) <hi>I believe, help thou mine unbelief;</hi> there was ſome Faith in him, but there was alſo Unbelief mixed with it; his Unbelief was ſo great that it was almoſt like to drown his Faith, but he puts it in Chriſt's hand, and will neither deny his Faith nor his Unbelief, but puts the matter ſincerely over upon Chriſt, to ſtrengthen his Faith, and to amend and help his Unbelief; It's a ſuſpect Faith that's at the top of Perfection at the very firſt, and ere ever ye wot; There are ſome ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls, that think becauſe they have ſome Unbelief, that therefore they have no Faith at all, but true Faith is ſuch a Faith that is by and beſide ſuſpected and feared or ſeen Unbelief; That Faith is ſureſt where Folk fear and ſuſpect Unbelief, and ſee it, and when they are weighted with their Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and cry out under it, and make their Unbelief an errand to Chriſt, it's a token there is Faith there. 3. The third Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is, That it will have with it a ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, and a fear to preſume in ſticking to Him; There will be two things ſtriving together, an eagerneſs to be at Him, and a fear that they be found pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous in medling with Him, and an holy trembling to think on it; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it muſt and will be adventured upon; the Woman ſpoken of <hi>Mark</hi> 5.28. lays this reckoning with her ſelf, <hi>If I can but touch his cloathes I ſhall be whole;</hi> and ſhe not only believeth this to be truth, but crouds and thrimbles in to be at him, yet <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. when ſhe comes before Chriſt, ſhe trembles as if ſhe had been taken in a fault, not having dared to come openly to Him, <hi>but behind him,</hi> ſhe behoved to have a touch of him, but ſhe durſt not in a manner own and avouch her doing of it till ſhe be unavoidably put to it; It's a ſuſpect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Faith that never trembled at minting to Believe; there is reaſon to be jealous that Faith not to be of the right ſtamp, that never walked under the impreſſion of the great diſtance between Chriſt and the Perſon, the ſenſe whereof is the thing that makes the trembling, I ſay not deſperation, nor any utter diſtruſt of Chriſt's kindneſs, but trembling ariſing from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great diſtance and diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that's between Him and the Perſon; Faith holds the Sinner a going to Chriſt, and the ſenſe of its own ſinfulneſs and worthleſneſs keeps him under holy fear and in the exerciſe of Humility; <hi>Paul</hi> once thought himſelf a jolly man, (as we may ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9.) but when he was brought to believe in Chriſt, he ſees that he was a dead and undone man before: I give you theſe three marks of a true Faith from that Chapter. 1. It diſcovers to a Man his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sinfulneſs, and particularly his former Self-conceit, Pride and Preſumption, I was, ſaith <hi>Paul, alive without the Law once,</hi> &amp;c. a man living upon the thoughts of his own Holineſs, <hi>but when the Law came I died;</hi> he fell quite from theſe high thoughts. A ſecond Mark is, A greater reſtleſneſs of the Body of Death, it becoming in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect worſe Company, more fretful, and ſtrugling more then ever it did before; <hi>Sin revived</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> though he had no more Corruption in him then he had before, but it wakened and beſtirred it ſelf more; I dare ſay that though there be not ſo much Corruption in a Believer as there is in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Man, yet it ſtrugleth much more, and is more painful and diſquieting to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and breeds him a greate dale more trouble, for ſays the Apoſtle on the matter, when God graciouſly poured Light and Life into me, Sin took that occaſion to grow angry, and to be enraged that ſuch a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was brought in beſide it, it could not endure that; as an unruly and curriſh Dog barks moſt bitterly when an honeſt Gueſt comes to the Houſe, ſo doth Corruption bark and make more noiſe then it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Grace takes place in the Soul: There are ſome that trow they have the more Faith becauſe they feel no Corruption ſtir in them, and there are others that think they have no Faith at all, becauſe they feel
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152256:63"/> Corruption ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gling more, and growing more troubleſome to them; but the ſtirring and ſtrugling of Corruption, if Folk be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed burdened, and affected, and afflicted with it, will rather prove their having of Faith then their wanting of it; Love that Faith well that puts and keeps Folk bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (to ſay ſo) in the Fight with the Body of Death; for though this be not good in it ſelf that Corruption ſtirreth, yet Sin is of that ſinful nature, that it flies always more in their face that look God and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, then of others that are ſleeping ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely under its Dominion. A third Mark is, When the Soul hath never Peace in any of its Conflicts or Combats with Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but when it reſolves in Faith exerciſed on Jeſus Chriſt, as it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> in that Chapter after his Converſion; That is a ſound Faith that only makes Peace at firſt by Chriſt, but that cannot (to ſay ſo) fight one fair ſtroke in the Spiritual Warfare, nor look Corruption in the face, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to it ſelf an outgate from any aſſault of the Enemy, but by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, as it was with the Apoſtle, who toward the end of that Chapter, lamentably crys, <hi>O! wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> yet imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly ſubjoyns Faiths triumphing in Chriſt, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord;</hi> he, belike, before his Converſion thought he could do well enough all alone, but it is not ſo now, when he can do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, eſpecially in this ſore War with his Corruption; That is a ſound Faith that makes the Sinner to make uſe of Chriſt in every thing he is called to, that yoaks him (I mean Chriſt) to work on every occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and particularly when it comes as it were to grapling and hand blows with this formidable Enemy the Body of Death this Monſter, whereof when one H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſed, and amongſt the reſt there is one, that generally the Hearers of the Goſpel think it ſo eaſie to Believe, that there is no difficulty in that by any thing; they think it hard to Pray, to keep the Sab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152256:63"/> purpoſe, <hi>and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> which in ſum is, there is much Preaching and many Hearers of the Goſpel, but little believing of it, few in whoſe Heart the work of Faith is wrought; It's but here one and there one that this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel hath efficacy upon, for uniting of them to Jeſus Chriſt, and for working a work of Saving Grace in them; the effectual working of God's Grace reaches the Hearts but of a few.</p>
            <p>For opening the words, we ſhall ſpeak a little to theſe three. 1. To what is meant by the <hi>Arm of the Lord.</hi> 2. To what is meant by the <hi>revealing</hi> of the Arm of the Lord. 3. To the ſcope and dependance of theſe words on the former.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> In general know, the <hi>Arm</hi> of the Lord is no to be underſtood <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly;</hi> the Lord being a Spirit. hath no Arms, Hands, nor Feet as Men have; But it's to be underſtood <hi>figuratively,</hi> as hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out ſome Property or Attribute of God; By the <hi>Arm</hi> of the Lord then we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in general the Power of God, the Arm of Man being that whereby He exerc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth His Power, performeth Exploits, or doth any Work: So the <hi>Arm</hi> of the Lord is His Power whereby He produceth His Mighty Acts; as it's ſaid in the <hi>Pſalms, The right hand of the Lord hath done valiantly, His hand and his arm hath got him the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> and becauſe the Power of God is taken either more generally for that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erced in the Works of common Providence, or more particul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rly for that which is put forth in the Work of Saving Grace; We t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke it here in ſhort to be the Grace of God exercing its Power in and by the Goſpel, for the converting of Souls, and cauſing them ſavingly to Believe, ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that believes;</hi> not ſimply as it conſiſts in ſpeaking of good, ſweet, and ſeaſonable words, but as it cometh backed by the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable Power of the Grace of God, as the word is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23, 24. <hi>We preach Chriſt to the</hi> Jews <hi>a ſtumbling block, and to the</hi> Greeks <hi>fooliſhneſs but unto them who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Greeks, <hi>the power of God and the wiſdom of God;</hi> and that it is ſo to be taken here, the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ion of theſe words with the former will make it clear, for ſure he is not ſpeaking of the Power of God in the works of common Providence, but of His Power in the converſion of Souls to Chriſt, even of that Power which works Saving Faith in the Elect.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>ſecond,</hi> The <hi>revealing</hi> of the Arm of the Lord, By this we do not underſtand the revealing of it <hi>objectively</hi> as it's brought to light by the preaching of the Goſpel, for thus it's revealed to all the Hearers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, it's in this reſpect not keeped hid, but brought forth clearly to them in the Word: And therefore ſecondly, The revealing of this Arm or Power of the Lord, is to be underſtood of the <hi>ſubjective</hi> inward mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſting of it, with efficacy and life to the Heart, by the effectual operation of the Spirit of the Lord; as it's ſaid of the great things prepared for them that love God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. <hi>But God hath revealed them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by his Spirit;</hi> it's that which is called 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>the demonſtration of the ſpirit and of power,</hi> which makes plain and powerful to the ſpirit of the Hearer inwardly that which the Word preacheth outwardly to the Ear, which without this would ſtrick only on the Ear, and yet remain ſtill an hidden Myſtery; This is the <hi>revealing</hi> of the Lord's Arm that is here ſpoken of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is that on which Believing depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and of the want whereof the Prophet ſadly complaineth, even where there was much Preaching.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>third,</hi> to wit, the Scope, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, and connexion of theſe words with the former, We conceive they come in, both for Confirmation and for Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former words. 1. For Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, There are (as hath been ſaid) but few that Believe, for there are but few that have this ſaving and effectual work of God's Grace re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ching their Heart; though they have the Word preached to them, yet they have not the Arm of the Power of God's Grace manifeſted to them, and ſo He confirms His former Doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the paucity of Believers under the preaching of the Goſpel. Firſt, By aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fewneſs of them that are brought to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:152256:64"/> Believe, to be converted, and effectually called by the Goſpel; which comes to paſs through their own Unbelief: And Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, By aſſerting their fewneſs in reſpect of God's ſoveraign applying of His Grace in the Goſpel, which is but to few; it's but few that Believe, for it's but few that He makes effectual application of His Grace to. 2. We ſay it comes in to clear and explicate the former words, whether we take it by way of a Reaſon, or of an anſwer to an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; For if it be ſaid, how can it be that <hi>Iſaiah, Paul,</hi> yea, and our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, ſhould preach ſo powerfully, and yet that ſo few ſhould Believe? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, it's not to be marvelled at, in reſpect of God as if he were fruſtrate of his deſign, no ſuch matter; It's becauſe the Power of Jeſus Chriſt is revealed but to few; and we take this the rather to be the meaning of theſe words, becauſe when Chriſt is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and many take offence and ſtumble, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.43, 44. he ſays, <hi>Murmure not among your ſelves, no man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me, draw him;</hi> there muſt be an effectual work of the Grace of God put forth on the Heart, elſe none will believe on me: So its ſaid <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.37, 38. that <hi>they believed not on Him, that the ſaying of</hi> Iſaias <hi>might be fulfilled which he ſpoke, Lord who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? therefore they could not believe, becauſe that</hi> Iſaias <hi>ſaid again, He hath blinded their eyes,</hi> &amp;c. he ſpeaketh not ſo, to appologize for, or to excuſe their Unbelief, but to ſhew the connexion that is betwixt theſe two, the not revealing of the Arm of the Lord, and their not Believing; even ſo here, the Lord ſhews the connexion that is betwixt the efficacy of the work of Grace, and believing or turning to God, that where the powerful and effectual work of His Grace goeth not forth with the preached Goſpel, there will be then no believing nor converſion, no ſaving change of the Perſon from Nature to Grace.</p>
            <p>That which we would ſay from theſe words, may be drawn to three Doctrines, which I ſhall firſt propoſe, and then clear and apply them for uſe. The firſt is, That in the work of Converſion and begetting of Saving Faith, there is requiſite and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, beſide the preaching of the Word, a diſtinct, inward, peculiar, real, immediate, efficacious, and powerful work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord on the Hearts of as many Hearers as are converted by this Goſpel. 2. That it is but few of many Hearers in whom the Lord thus efficaciouſly and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually works by His Spirit and the Power of His Grace, it's but here one and there one, a very few who are thus wrought upon and converted. 3. That there is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and inſeparable connexion betwixt this inward and efficacious work of the Spirit, and Faith or Converſion; Where this work of Grace is not, there cannot be Faith, and where it is, Faith neceſſarily muſt be, otherways theſe two could not be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable of equal extent and reciprocal, <hi>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> He is not, neither can be a Believer to whom it is not reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he is, and cannot but be a Believer to whom it is revealed.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> We ſay there is in the work of Converſion, and begetting of Faith, beſide the preaching of the Goſpel, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, inward, peculiar, real, immediate, efficacious, and powerful work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord requiſite and neceſſary for Converſion and begetting of Faith, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Sin, and to humble for it, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the Mind in the Knowledge of Chriſt, to renew the Will and Affections, and to perſwade and enable the Soul of the Sinner to embrace and receive Jeſus Chriſt as He is offered in the Goſpel. We ſhall <hi>firſt</hi> take notice of, and clear ſome words in the Doctrine, and then confirm it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For clearing of ſome words in the Doctrine, we ſay, 1. It is a <hi>diſtinct</hi> work of the Spirit, diſtinguiſhed and ſeparable from the Word; though it goes along as He pleaſeth with the Word, yet it is not as if there were ſome Power infuſed into the Word, and went always and neceſſarily along with the Word, which is the fooliſh and groundleſs conceit of ſome, for albeit it accompany the Word, yet it's from a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Agent, working, and a diſtinct work,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:152256:64"/> and is ſeparable (as I ſaid) from the Word, though it be wrought on the Heart of the ſame Sinner to whoſe Ear the Word is preached. 2. It's an <hi>inward</hi> work of the Spirit, for beſide the outward and external preaching and calling by the Word, there is an inward, powerful, effectual work and calling of the Spirit in the converſion of a Sinner, which ſpeaks to the Heart, as well as the Word ſpeaks to the Ear; ſo that this work of the Spirit that goes along in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, is much more then any external perſwaſion of the preached Word can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. 3. We ſay it's a <hi>peculiar</hi> work, to difference it from what is common to the Hearers of the Goſpel, for it's a work that is peculiar to them whom the Lord converts, and is applied to none other, but to thoſe in whom He works Faith, and whom He ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually calleth by His Grace; It's a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar work then and not common, for if it were common to all the Hearers of the Goſpel, and not peculiar to ſome, theſe two could not go together and be commenſurable (as we ſaid) <hi>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> 4. We ſay it's a <hi>real</hi> work as well as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; A real work of the Spirit, that is not only able and powerful to produce the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and to convert the Sinner, but real and powerful in producing and bringing of it about, and to paſs by a real influence of the Spirit, actually renewing the Will, infuſing and creating the habits of Grace, &amp; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the very habit of Faith amongſt others in the Soul; which is quite an other thing then the ſuppoſing and ſaying that a Man hath power to Believe and be Converted, that there is no more requiſite to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, but to perſwade him to put forth that Power or Strength which he hath into Exerciſe or Practice; It's a real work of the Spirit, and a powerful bringing about of the converſion of the Sinner in a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way, as they ſay in the School. 5. We ſay it is an <hi>immediate</hi> work of the Spirit on the Heart, to difference it from a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate perſwaſion, or moral ſwaſion (as it's called) as if there were no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in Converſion but God's enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Mind, and by that perſwading the Will to cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any immediate work of the Spirit on the Will it ſelf; In this Doctrine, we take in all theſe according to the Scripture, in oppoſition to the ſeveral Errors vented by Men of corrupt Minds, anent the work of Converſion and of Saving Faith; God's Arm and Hand muſt be revealed, the work and power of His efficacious Grace muſt be put forth, for moving and enclining the Heart and Affections, and for determining the Will it ſelf.</p>
            <p>We might farther clear and confirm all theſe from that famous inſtance of <hi>Lydia, Act.</hi> 16.14. where <hi>Paul</hi> preaching to ſome Women, it's ſaid of her, <hi>Whoſe heart the Lord opened, that ſhe attended to the things which were ſpoken of</hi> Paul, where we find theſe things differenced. 1. The Lord's powerful work on her heart from <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching to her Ear, the Lord <hi>opened</hi> her Heart. 2. It's an inward work, for it's on the <hi>Heart.</hi> 3. It's a peculiar work, it's not all who hear <hi>Paul</hi> preach whoſe Hearts are opened, but it's the Heart <hi>of one Lydia.</hi> 4. It's in the nature of it a real work, that makes a real inward change on her. 5. It's an immediate work, for the Lord not only enlightens her Judgment, but goes down to the Heart and opens it, and works a change in it immediatly; <hi>Paul</hi> indeed by his preaching opens the way of Salvation to all that heard him, from which, though many go away with their Hearts unopened, yet the Lord hath a ſecret, myſterious, real, inward work on her Heart, which is evidenced by the effect, for He not only enlightens her Mind, but makes her wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly yield to the call of the Goſpel, by opening of her Heart.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, To ſpeak a little for confirmation of the Doctrine, we would conſider theſe four or five Grounds or Reaſons, to ſhew that there is ſuch a work of the Spirit wherever Faith is begotten, and that moſt intelligibly in them that are at Age. 1. It's clear from theſe places of Scripture, where there is an expreſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction and difference put betwixt the outward Miniſtry of the Word, and this inward, powerful, efficacious work of Grace

It's clear, and may be confirmed from the Power of God which He puts forth and applys in the begetting of Faith and in working Converſion; It's not a mediate work whereby He only perſwades congruouſly, as ſome love to ſpeak, but an immediate and efficacious work, whereby with mighty Power He works Converſion, <hi>It is God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2 13.) <hi>that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure;</hi> and as he not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth but effectually worketh, ſo he not only works on the Judgment to the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, but on the Will, to encline and determine it, by curing it of its crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perverſneſs, backwardneſs, obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, and rebellion; and the Power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by He worketh this great work is ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. <hi>To be that ſame mighty power which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead, that ye may know</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>what is the exceeding greatneſs of his pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It may alſo be cleared from ſome in whom this Power is exerced, as ſome Children, ſome deaf Perſons, and others, whom we cannot deny to be reached by the Grace of God, and yet there can be no other way how th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We ſhall only add two Reaſons further, to confirm and ſome-way to clear why it is that the Lord works, and muſt work thus diſtinctly, inwardly, really, powerfully, and immediatly in working Faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of Sinners: The firſt is drawen from the exceeding great deadneſs, indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, averneſs, perverſneſs, impotency, inability, and impoſſibility that is in us na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally for the exerciſing of Faith in Chriſt; If Men naturally be dead in Sins and Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, if the Mind be blind, if the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be quite diſordered, and if the Will be utterly corrupted and perverted; then that which converts, and changes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues them, muſt be a real inward, peculiar, immediate, powerful work of the Spirit of God; there being no inward ſeed of the Grace of God in them to be quickened, that ſeed muſt be communicate to them, and ſowen in them ere they can believe, which can be done by no leſs nor lower Power then this Power of God's Grace; It's not Oratory as I ſaid, nor excellency of Speech that will do it; it's ſuch a work as begers the Man again, and actually renews him. The ſecond is drawen from God's end in the way of giving Grace, comuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it to ſome and not to others; If God's end in being gracious to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. The firſt Uſe is for the refutation of ſeveral Errors, and for the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a great Truth of the Goſpel which we profeſs.</p>
            <p>It ſerves I ſay, Firſt, For the refutation of Errors, which in ſuch an Auditory we love not to inſiſt on; yet we cannot here, the Ground being ſo clear, and the Call ſo cogent, forbear to ſay ſomewhat bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ion of God's Grace among Men, and to exalt proud Nature, and that there is here a collection and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation of theſe deſigns and ways againſt the Truth which this Doctrine holds forth, vented by corrupt Men. As 1. They will have nothing to be neceſſarily applyed for the working of Converſion, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed, that all Men have univerſal or common
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:152256:66"/> Grace, which God by His Soveraignty, ſay they was obliged to give, elſe he could not not reaſonably require Faith of them; and upon this comes in the pleaded for Power of Free-will, and Mans ability to turn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God; others by pleading for this notion of a Light within Men, become to be Patrons of proud and petulant corrupt Nature, as if there were need of nothing to beget Saving Faith but that common Grace within, and Oratory or Swaſion of Mouth from without; And hence they came to maintain the fouleſt Errors, which have not only been condemned by the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch of God in all Ages, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t have even by ſome Papiſts been abominated; and many of theſe ſame Errors are creeping in even in theſe times wherein we live, the deſign whereof is to tempt Folk to turn looſe, vain, and proud, and to turn the Grace of God into wantonneſs, as if they needed not at all to depend on God and His Grace, having a ſufficient ſtock within themſelves on which they can live well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: And it's not only the Errors of <hi>Papiſts, Pelagians, Socinians, Arminians,</hi> or Errors in the Judgment that we have to do with; but of ſuch as overturn the very foundation of the work of Man's Salvation, and who though pretending to higher no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, do yet go beyond all theſe. But if it be true, that in the work of Converſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the preaching of the Word, there is a diſtinct, real, inward, peculiar, immediate, efficacious work of the Spirit, neceſſary for bringing about ſuch an effect; Then there is no common and univerſal Grace that all the Hearers of the Goſpel have, nor is there any Power or Ability in Man to believe of himſelf; otherwiſe there were no neceſſity of ſuch a work as this for the converting of a Sinner, the Prophet needed not to cry, <hi>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> And Chriſt needed not ſay, <hi>No man can come to me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Father draw him;</hi> for Men might come without drawing, and believe without the revelation of God's Arm: But in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to that, we ſay and have made it clear, that the work of Converſion is brought about by a diſtinct, peculiar, powerful, real, and immediate work of the Spirit on the Heart, whereby he not only enlightens the Mind, but renews the Will and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Affections. 2. There is another Error that this refutes, which ſeems to be more ſubtile, for ſome will grant a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry connexion betwixt the effect, and the Grace of God, who yet ſay that it is ſwaſion or perſwaſion (for here we take theſe for the ſame,) ſo and ſo tryſted to prevail with ſome, that brings about the effect or work of Converſion in them, and not in others where that perſwaſion is not ſo tryſted; but this opinion lays not the weight of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the Arm of the Lord, but on ſome circumſtances accompanying the work, and leaves ſtill ſome ground of boaſting in the Creature. 3. A third Error which this Doctrine refutes, is that of ſome others, who will have Grace neceſſarily to go alongs with the Word in the working of Faith, but ſo as it reacheth not the Will, but that the Will neceſſarily determines it ſelf; as if the Will were not corrupt, or as if that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is in the Will were indeed no Corruption, as if that Corruption that is in the Will could be any more removed from the Will without the immediate work of the Spirit upon it, then Darkneſs can be removed from the Judgment without the Spirits immediate work on it: But ſeing the Will is the prime ſeat of Man's perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs while in Nature, and the principal part to be renewed; It's a ſtrange thing to ſay, that in the work of Converſion, other faculties and powers of the Soul muſt be renewed, and yet that this which comes neareſt to the life of the Soul ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld be neglected, or not ſtand in need of renovation: But from this Text it is clear, that in Converſion the Arm of the Lord muſt be revealed, and that there is a powerful work of Grace that not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents reaſons from the Word to move the Will, but really regenerates and renews the Will: Now what is for the refutation of it theſe Errors ſerves alſo to confirm us in the Truth of the Doctrine oppoſite to theſe Errors.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It ſerves to refute ſomething in Folks Practice, and that is, their little ſenſe of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:152256:66"/> the need of Grace; Moſt part come and hear Preaching as if they had the habit of Faith, and as if it were natural to them, and pretend to the exerciſe of Faith, never once ſuſpecting their want of Faith, nor think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they ſtand in need of ſuch a work of Grace to work it in them, as if it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them not to Believe; Hence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think that they have Grace enough, and if they Pray, it's that they may do well, never minding the corruption of Nature that is in them, and indeed it is no wonder that ſuch Perſons fall readily into Error, when their Practice ſays plainly they think they have Grace enough already.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Doctrine</hi> is, That this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, real, inward, efficacious, powerful work of the Grace of God in Converſion, is not common to all the Hearers of the Goſpel, but is a rare thing applied but to few, it's even as rare as Faith is; And what we touched on to evidence the rarity of Faith, will ſerve alſo to evidence the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this work of Grace in Converſion; It's on as many as are Believers, and are ſaved, that the work of Grace is revealed, and no moe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.14. <hi>I will take one of a city, and two of a family, and bring you to</hi> Zion, <hi>ſaith the Lord;</hi> It's two or three in the corner of a Paroch, or in the end of a Town, to ſpeak ſo, who are converted, and the reſt are ſuffered to ly in black Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If the reaſon hereof be erquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this might be ſufficient to ſtop all Mouths, which the Lord gives, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemeth good in thy ſight;</hi> It is of the Lord, who is Debitor to none, and <hi>who</hi> as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15. <hi>ſhews mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardens;</hi> and here we muſt be ſilent and lay our hand on our Mouth and anſwer no more, all being found guilty, He is juſt in what He doeth, in calling or not calling, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, as He ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſeth; And yet ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Lord hath thought good to call few of many, for holy and wiſe ends, As 1. To hold forth His own Soveraignty, and that He is free, and will walk freely in the diſpencing of His own Grace; Hence, He not only takes few, but ordinarily theſe that are the moſt mean, contemptible, ſilly, and in a manner fooliſh, of the multitude of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; <hi>It is not many noble, not many wiſe, according to the fleſh, not many rich, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned,</hi> that He chooſeth and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, very ordinarily He hides His Grace from theſe; It's but ſeldom that He calls and takes the ſtout and valiant Man, and the learned Scholler, but it's this and that poor mean Man, the Weaver, the Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, the ſimple Plough-man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whom moſt ordinarily He calls, when He ſuffers others to continue in their Sin. 2. That He may make all the Hearers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel walk in holy fear and awe of Him, He reveals His Grace in few; It's not the multitude that believes, but here one and there one, that all that have the Offer of Grace may fear leſt they miſs it and receive it in vain, and may be careful to entertain and make right uſe of the Means of Grace, and may withall cheriſh the Spirit in His motions, and not grieve Him. O! if ye knew and believed what a rare thing the work of the Spirit of Grace is, ye would be feared to quench, extinguiſh, or put out any of His motions. 3. As to the Godly, He does thus, To make them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, adore, and praiſe His Grace, and the Power of it ſo much the more.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> are three. 1. It ſerves to move all to reverence, adore, and admire the Grace of God, and His ſoveraign way in it; Preſume not to debate or diſpute with Him, becauſe there are few that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and few that He hath determined His Grace for, it's an evidence of His dread, a proof of His ſoveraignty, in which he ſhould be ſilently ſtooped unto, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently adored, and not diſputed with; we ought to bound all our reaſoning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in His good pleaſure, who might have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken many and left few, or taken none as pleaſed Him; And we ſhould not think ſtrange, nor fret that the Goſpel is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful but on few, here is the reaſon of it that may qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t us, the Lord hath determined effectually to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll but few, and yet he will not want one of His own; <hi>All that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given to Chriſt, ſhall come to Him,</hi> though none come but as they are <hi>drawen</hi> in. A thing that we ſhould be ſenſible of,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:152256:67"/> but yet calm and quiet our Spirits, rather wondering that He hath choſen and calleth one, then fret becauſe he hath paſt by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. The ſecond Uſe is to exhort you that are Hearers of the Goſpel, and have not had this diſtinct and powerful work of Grace begetting Faith in you, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of this Truth, that Faith and the work of Grace is no common thing; The moſt part alace! think that they have Grace, and that it is not one of many that want it, they will readily ſay, it's true I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve of my ſelf, but God hath given me the Grace; But I would aſk you this queſtion, Do you think that Grace is ſo common a thing that it comes to you and ye never know how, or ſo common that never a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wants it? If not, how cometh it then to paſs that ye think and ſpeak of Grace as ye do? we would think it a great length, if many of you could be perſwaded of your Graceleſneſs; It's not our part to point particularly at the Man and Woman, though the deeds of many of you ſay within our Heart that there is no fear of God before your eyes, and that many of you think ye have Grace who never had it; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d ſay theſe three or four words to you. 1. Begin and ſuſpect your ſelves that matters are not right betwixt God and you, we bid none of you deſpair, but we bid the moſt part of you be ſuſpicious of your condition; ſuſpect, nay be aſſured, that Hypocriſie is not Grace, and that your Preſumption is not Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, for if but few get Grace, then many ſhould ſuſpect them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elves, and ſeing Grace is ſo rare a thing, do not ye think it common. 2. Neglect no means that may bring you through Grace to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieve, but be diligent in the uſe of them all, of the Word, Prayer, Sacraments, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's by theſe that the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets Grace, and by neglecting of them ye may make your ſelves guilty of deſtroying your own Souls. 3. Beaware of quenching the Spirit in any of His Operations or Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of ſmothering or putting out any Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges or Convictions; If the Conſcience be at any time touched, or the Affections tickled, go not away as the temporary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever doeth, ſitting down there without going any further; Fear to ſtrangle the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of the life of Grace, for Grace may begin at little; and if ye quench any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Conviction, or Challenge, ye know not if ever ye ſhall meet with the like again, becauſe when He knocked hard at your Heart ye held Him out and keeped Him at the door; and ye may be in hazard of that terrible charge, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.31. <hi>Ye uncircumciſed in heart and ears, ye have always reſisted the Holy Ghoſt, as your Fathers did ſo do ye.</hi> 4. Seing this work is not common to all the Hearers of the Goſpel, but peculiar to ſome, labour to have it made ſure to your ſelves, by putting it to proof and tryal in good earneſt.</p>

Learn from this to be humble, <hi>What haſt thou man but what thou haſt received? and if thou haſt received it, why doest thou boaſt as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> O! but it's unſuitable to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers who are Free-Graces-Debtors and Beggers (whereof yet none need to think ſhame,) to be proud and forget themſelves; Thou haſt nothing Believer to boaſt of, but that He hath ſhamed thee with His Grace, and ſhouldeſt thou be proud of that as if thou had made thy ſelf thus? therefore guard watchfully againſt all puffing up, ſelf-conceit, and high-mindedneſs, and ſtudy to be humble, and to carry a low S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Folks pride is like to break their Necks; for when once Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit creeps in, they begin to think they are ſo far advanced in Holineſs, that they muſt not keep Company with others, nor joyn in Worſhip with them, and from that they go to another thing, and from that to a third, that it is hard to tell where they wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> halt or end; they grow ſo giddy that they are ſcarcely like to leave ſo much Ground as themſelves may ſtand upon: O! think ſhame of Pride, it's a moſt intollerable
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:152256:67"/> thing to be proud of that which God hath given, wherein ye have no more hand, and whereof ye can no more boaſt, then they who never had it. 2. Be thankful and give God the praiſe of that ye have gotten; <hi>It becomes the upright to be thankful;</hi> It's no little matter to have God's Power manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the working of Faith and conferring Grace; The temporal Throne and Kingdom, and great things in the World, are nothing to this, it's peculiar to the Lord's own, and not common; Many get their fill of the World, who never get nor will get this; The World is of ſo little value with the Lord, that to ſpeak ſo, He doeth not much regard who get it, though it be ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Be compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and tender towards others, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is only Grace that hath made the difference betwixt you and them, and not any good nature in you which was not in them as ſome fooliſhly fancy; Be not puft up at the faults and falls of any, but rather mourn for them as well as for your own, and be the more humble when ye think of the difference that Grace hath made, leſt ye fall; and ſince your ſtanding is by Grace, be not high-minded, but fear; of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons it worſe becomes you to look lightly on. let be to mock at the falls of others, conſidering who, and what hath made the diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE way of the Grace of God is a very difficult Subject to be thought on or ſpoken of ſuitably and as it becomes, Grace hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſoveraign and unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Channel of its own wherein it runs; yet no doubt it is very uſeful now and then to conſider it, if we knew how to make uſe of it aright; yea even theſe ſteps of Grace that are moſt croſs and contrary to carnal Reaſon, may not a little profite when duely pondered; Thus when the Prophet hath been looking on the ſcarcity of Faith, and on the paucity of true Believers, he looks a little further then on the external preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, even in upon the way of God's Grace, not out of any curi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſity, nor from a fretting humour, becauſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfulneſſe of his Miniſtry, but that he may thereby get himſelf ſtayed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and that he may bring both himſelf and others, to reverence and adore the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſoveraign way of God therein; <hi>To whom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the arm of the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed?</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:152256:68"/> It's a word like that which Chriſt had on the like occaſion, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure not among your ſelves, no man can come to me, except the Father who hath ſent me, draw him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We opened up the meaning of the words the laſt day; In ſhort they come to this, as if he had ſaid, how few are they that believe the Goſpel, and who take the Word off the hand of His ſent Miniſters? and how few are they on whom the Grace of God that only can make men believe, does effectually work; the Prophet pointing at a higher hand then that of the Miniſters in the ſucceſs and fruitleſsneſs of the Goſpel, and coupling theſe two together, the Preaching of the Word and the Power of God's Grace in the working of Faith and Converſion in Sinners.</p>
            <p>We propoſed theſe three Doctrines to be ſpoken to from the words. 1. That in the work of Converſion and begetting of Faith, beſide the preaching of the Word, there is a powerful, internal, immediat work of the Grace of God, exerciſed within Mens Hearts, as well as the Word is preached outwardly to the Ear, wherever Faith is begotten, theſe two go together, the Word without, and the power of Grace within the one of which is diſtinct from the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this powerful, internal, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate work of Grace within, is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the Hearers of the Goſpel, but a rare, and peculiar thing to ſome, <hi>to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> it's but one or few of many to whom it's revealed; To theſe we have ſpoken already.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third is (which indeed holds out the ſcope of all,) that there is an inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable connexion betwixt theſe two, the begetting of Faith in the Hearers of the Goſpel, and the application of this power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful work of the Grace of God for working of it, ſo that where this powerful work of Grace is not, there is never Faith nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion wrought, and where this powerful work of Grace is, there is Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; The Prophet makes them recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and commenſurable; who is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever? he to whom the Arm of the Lord is revealed; and who is the Unbeliever? he to whom the Arm of the Lord is not revealed; Theſe two are ſo conjoyned and knit together, as they are never ſeparated, and ſo they muſt ſtand or fall together.</p>
            <p>That we may be the more clear, we ſhall take up the Doctrine in two diſtinct Branches, The firſt whereof is, That except the powerful work of God's Grace concur, the moſt powerful preaching of the Goſpel will never beget Faith in the Hearts of the Hearers of it. The ſecond is, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this powerful work of Grace goes along with the preaching of the Goſpel, or wherever the Lord applyes His Grace with the Word preached, there Faith is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Heart, and that Soul is effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united to Chriſt, and ſavingly changed; The one of theſe Branches ſerves to ſhew the neceſſity of God's Grace from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our ſinfulneſs and impotency or inability, and of the emptineſs and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectualneſs of all outward Means in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo to ſtop all Mens Mouthes as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing utterly unable to contribute any thing to their own ſpiritual Good or Converſion, that being the product of the Grace of God; The other Branch ſerves mightily to commend the Grace of God, as being the powerful Arm of the Lord, that brings to Believe, that calls and converts ſuch and ſuch Perſons, according to a prior engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and tranſaction betwixt the Father and the Son.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt of theſe, It will eaſily be believed among Men and Women that have any true ſenſe and feeling of the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Nature, and find dayly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Law of the Members warring againſt the Law of the Mind; and we are perſwaded, if all that ever received Faith were brought to depone in this matter, they would bear witneſs, that there is no Mean that without the effectual Power of the Grace of God, can bring a ſtranger Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to cloſe with Chriſt and believe on Him; and if all that are now before the Throne of God in Heaven, were called to ſpeak to this great Truth, they would put their ſeal to it, and ſay, <hi>Not unto us, but to thy Name be the glory of our believing, we had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved if it had been left to the power of our
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:152256:68"/> own Free-will, and if the power of thy Grace had not wrought in us the very Will as well as the Deed or Act of believing.</hi> Yet becauſe this Doctrine (as we ſaid) ſerves to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſinfulneſs and impotency of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and how little we are obliged to our ſelves in this great work; and to hold forth the abſolute neceſſity of the Grace of God, and how much we are obliged to it in the work of Faith and Converſion; and to hold forth withall the emptineſs and ineffectualneſs of all outward Means with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Grace, and becauſe it wants not its own conſiderable oppoſition from the enemies of the Truth, we ſhall give you ſome Grounds for confirmation of it, The firſt whereof is drawen from theſe expreſs inſtances of Scripture wherein it is clear, That there hath been much powerful Preaching, and by the moſt eminent Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and yet the generality of People have been fruitleſs under it, and their fruitleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath been brought to this very Ground, to wit, that the work of God's Grace and His out-ſtretched Arm went not along with it. The firſt inſtance is <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.4. That <hi>Moſes</hi> was a ſkilled Preacher, who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? he being faithful in all the Houſe of God, yet ſays he, after much and long Preaching, and after many Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders wrought, <hi>the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, nor eyes to ſee, nor ears to hear unto this day;</hi> where he not only puts a difference betwixt the preaching of the Word without, and the work of Grace within, but ſhows the neceſſity of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rrence of the work of Grace, and lays the great weight of the Peoples profiting or not profiting, on the wanting or having of that: A ſecond inſtance, is in this Prophet <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> were there any among all the Preachers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or ſince, that preached in a more Evangelick ſtrain then he did? and yet when he hath complained of the paucity of Believers, ſaying, <hi>who hath believed our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?</hi> he fixes and ſtays on this as the cauſe, <hi>to whom is the arm of the Lord reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.9, 10. he gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſad Commiſſion he had from the Lord, who ſaid to him, <hi>Go and tell the people, Hear ye indeed but underſtand not, and ſee ye indeed but perceive not, make the heart of this people ſat,</hi> &amp;c. where there is alſo a clear diſtinction made betwixt the inward working of Grace, and the outward Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. A third inſtance, and one that is beyond all exception, is in our bleſs'd Lord Jeſus, <hi>who ſpake as never man ſpoke,</hi> and preached with ſuch power and life, that even carnal Hearers <hi>wondered at the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words which proceeded out of his mouth, for he preached with Authority and not as the</hi> Scribes, and yet <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to murmure at Him, what ſays He? <hi>Murmure not at theſe things, none can come to me, except the Father draw him;</hi> none can Believe, except the powerful Grace of God work Faith in him, there muſt be a higher hand then ought ye ſee or hear, a more powerful work then any external Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mine as Prophet of my Church, ere a Soul can believe on me; and though his Hearers were not free of the guilt of this their Unbelief, but had their own ſinful acceſſion unto their continuing in it, yet our Lord looks in on the ſoveraign way and work of Grace, and holds there, telling them that his external Miniſtry will not do the turn, but there muſt be an inward, powerful, immediate work of Grace for the working of Faith. We add a fourth inſtance, and it is of that choſen Veſſel <hi>Paul,</hi> who laboured more abundantly then all the reſt of the Apoſtles, and yet when he is Preaching, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.25. <hi>and ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and others believed not,</hi> before he diſmiſſes the multitude, he adds this one word, <hi>Well ſpake the Holy Ghost by</hi> Iſaiah <hi>the Prophet unto our fathers, ſaying, Go unto this People, and ſay, Hearing ye ſhall hear and ſhall not understand, and ſeeing ye ſhall ſee and not perceive,</hi> &amp;c. where he expreſsly differenceth his external Preaching from God's inward working, and tells, that ſo long as there was a judicial ſtroke on the Hearts of the People untaken away, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Preaching could do the turn as to their Converſion and bringing of them to Believe; which he alſo does to guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any offence that might be taken at the unſuccesfulneſs of his Miniſtry by any who would be ready to ſay, what aileth
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:152256:69"/> theſe Folk that they will not receive the Goſpel? to whom he anſwers, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> long before told the reaſon of it, to wit, that there is a Plague on their Hearts and Minds which God muſt remove ere they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To theſe plain and clear inſtances we may add two or three Grounds or Reaſons, As 1. The exceeding greatneſs of the work of Converſion, O how great and difficult is it! Therefore it's ſet out by the ſimilitudes and expreſſions of <hi>raiſing the dead, creating a new heart, of removing the ſtony heart,</hi> and the like, all tending to ſet out the neceſſity of an omnipotent Power or a powerful work of Grace, in the begetting of Souls to Chriſt; and if it be ſo great a work, what can the outward Miniſtry do, if the Power of God be not added? or what can the Man himſelf do here? can a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n quicken, raiſe, creat, or beget himſelf? it's true, theſe compariſons are not to be extended and and applied in every reſpect, yet they hold out that Man being naturally dead, can no more contribute to his own quickening and raiſing, and to the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>getting of ſpiritual life in himſelf, then a dead M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n can contribute to his own quickening and raiſing to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life; for which cauſe, the Holy Ghoſt hath made choice of theſe expreſſions, even to hold out the exceeding greatneſs of the work. 2. Conſider the condition that M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n are in when this work is wrought, and we will ſee they can contribute nothing to it, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t they have no aptitude for it, except that they are ſubjects capable to be wrought upon, being as it is <hi>Eph</hi> 2.1. <hi>dead in ſins and treſpaſſes;</hi> being as to their Souls eſtate, and as to their Spiritual condition, like <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body before the Lord breathed in it the Breath of Life, and made him a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul; as his Body could not move, ſtir, nor act till then, no more can the Natural Man ſtir or act in the ways of God till a new principle of Spiritual Life be put in him. To clear it further, we would conſider, that the Scripture ſpeaks of theſe three in the Natural Man. 1. Of an utter inability and deadneſs as to that which is Good, <hi>Dead in Sins, Eph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>We are not ſufficient</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.) <hi>of our ſelves as of our ſelves to think any thing,</hi> not ſo much as a good thought. 2. The Scripture holds him out not only as unable for good, but perverſe and bent to every thing that is Evil, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Alienated and enemies in our minds by wicked works; the carnal mind being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God,</hi> Rom. 8.7. it's plainly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to any thing that is Good, and ſo to the way of Faith. 3. Man's Mind is not only naturally perverſe and ſtuffed with Enmity, but in an incapacity to be healed while it remaineth ſuch, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>It is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be;</hi> and therefore in the work of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, there is not only an amending, but alſo a renewing of our Nature called for; there is more requiſite then the rectifying of ſomething in the Man, even the creating of new Habits, and the infuſing of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Spiritual Life and Motion into the Soul: It is true, in ſome Senſe the whole Image of God is not abſolutely removed, the faculties of the rational Soul ſtill remain, for Man hath an Underſtanding and a Will, and ſome ſort of Reaſon, but without any tendency to Spiritual Life, or to any action for God; he hath an Underſtanding, but it's wholly darkened; he hath a Will, but wholly perverſe, and not in the leaſt enclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Good; he hath Affections, but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſordered and corrupted, and ſet whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon wrong Objects; ſo that it's with Man's Soul as to Good, as it is with ſpoiled Wine; Wine when wholeſome, ſerves to cheer and refreſh, but when it's ſpoiled, it's quite another thing, not only not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to Health, but it's noiſome and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: It's juſt ſo we ſay with Man's Soul, it's by the Fall quite ſpoiled and corrupted; it is not indeed annihilated or made to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for it retains the ſame faculties ſtill; it hath (to ſpeak ſo) the ſame <hi>quantity</hi> ſtill, but as to it's <hi>qualities,</hi> it's utterly corrupted and carried cloſs contrary to God; <hi>it's not ſubject to the law of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed can be;</hi> and renovation by Grace, is the taking away of the corrupt qualities in part in this Life, and wholly in the other Life, and the bringing in of new qualities for recovering the beauty of that Image of God which Man hath loſt. 4. Conſider
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:152256:69"/> the end that God hath in the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of His Grace, and the Glory that He will needs have it getting in every gracious work, and more eſpecially in the work of Converſion, and the ſilence, as to any boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that He will have all put unto that ſhall partake of it; His end in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of His Grace, is to bring down Pride, to ſtop all Mouths, and to remove all grounds of boaſting from the Creature, that He only may have the glory of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; that when ever that queſtion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, <hi>What haſt thou O man, but what thou haſt received? and if thou haſt received it, why doeſt thou boaſt? who made thee to differ from another?</hi> the Soul may anſwer, it was not external Preaching, nor my own Free-will, nor any thing in me, but the power of God's Grace, I have nothing but what I have received: It is on this ground that the Apoſtle <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. preſſeth and encourageth Chriſtians to their great work, <hi>Work out</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your own ſalvation in fear and trembling, for it's God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure;</hi> the Lord leaveth not to Man the working of the Will in himſelf, <hi>and of him,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 30.31. <hi>are ye in Christ Jeſus, who is made of God unto us, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, that he that glorieth ſhould glory in the Lord,</hi> as he ſaid before, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. <hi>that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence;</hi> there is one ground of boaſting that the Lord wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It writes to us in great and legible Letters, the great emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs and ſinfulneſs of all Fleſh, who not only do not good, but have ſinned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of a capacity to do good; all Men and Women have brought themſelves thus lamentably low by Sin, that now if Heaven were to be had by a wiſh, ſincerely and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought forth, yet it is not in their power to perform that condition; and though it now ſtands upon the ſtreatching forth of the hand of Faith to receive Jeſus Chriſt, yet of themſelves they cannot even do this; how ought then Sinners to be deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, who have brought themſelves to this woful paſs? I am afraid that many of you do not believe that ye are ſuch as cannot Believe, nor do any Good till His Grace work effectually in you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It teacheth you not to idolize any inſtrument or mean of Grace, how preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and promiſing ſoever; No Preaching, if it were of a Prophet, or an Apoſtle, yea of an Angel, will do the turn, without Grace come with it; there is a neceſſity of the revelation of God's Arm, and of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of His Grace, not only to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, but to every duty ye go about; Ye ſhould therefore fear and tremble when ye go about any Ordinance, leſt the Arm of the Lord be not put forth in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It ſhould make you more ſerious in dealing with God for His effectual bleſſing to every Mean and Ordinance, ſeing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that no Ordinance can profite you.</p>

            <p n="5">5. The main <hi>Uſe</hi> of it is for confirming and eſtabliſhing you in the Faith of the Truth proponed in the Doctrine, and for confuting and overturning the contrary Error, that, as it were, in contempt of the Grace of God, exalts proud Nature, and gives Man's Free-will ſo great a hand in the work of Converſion; That the main thing that makes the difference ſhall not be attributed to the Grace of God, but to the Free-will of the Creature, which of it ſelf choiſed the Grace of God offered when another rejected it: It may indeed ſeem ſtrange that the Devil ſhould ſo far have prevailed with Chriſtians that profeſs the Faith of Original Sin, and of the neceſſity of a Saviour, as to make them look at Grace as uſeleſs in this prime ſtep of Converſion and renewing of a Sinner, that when the Grace of God and Man's Free-will come to be compared, Man's Will ſhould have the preference and preheminence, the higheſt place and commendation in the work, and that the great weight of it ſhould ly there, and that proud Nature ſhould be thus bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered up that it ſhall ſtand in need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the Man's Converſion, but the right uſe-making of what it hath in it ſelf: And yet it's no wonder that the Devil drive this deſign vigorouſly, for what ſhorter cut can there be taken by him to ruine Souls, then to make them drink in this Error, that Nature and Free-will will do their turn? and ſo take them off from all dependance on Free-Grace, and on Jeſus Chriſt, and give them ground of boaſting in themſelves; for when it is thus, of neceſſity they muſt ruine and periſh; this ſhould ſure, make you loath this Error the more: And we are perſwaded, that the day is coming, wherein the Truth oppoſite to this Error, ſhall be confirmed on the Souls and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of all the Oppoſers of it, and wherein, the maintaining of this Error ſhall be found a confirmation of Mans Enmity at Gods Grace, which is not ſubject to His Law, nor indeed can be.</p>
            <p>But there are three Queſtions that may be moved here, to which we would ſpeak a word. 1. If the Preaching of the Goſpel cannot beget Faith, without the powerful work of Gods Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, what is the uſe of the Goſpel, or wherefore ſerves it? 2. If Men cannot Believe without the work of Grace, which the Lord ſoveraignly diſpenſeth, why doth He yet find fault and expoſtulate with Men for their not Believing? 3. If Grace perform all, and Men can make no mean effectual, nor do any good without it, what then ſhould Men do to come by Believing, and this work of His Grace?</p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> We ſhall not ſay much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; only, ſeing the Lord hath made choice of the Goſpel to be the ordinary external Mean of Grace, and of the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Faith, there is no reaſon to ſay that it's uſeleſs; for though it be not the main and only thing that turns the Sinner, but the Lord hath reſerved it to Himſelf as His own Prerogative, to convert and change the Heart of a Rebel-ſinner, yet he hath appointed it to be made uſe of, as He hath appointed Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, for many good and notable ends, uſes, and advantages that are reached and come by the preaching of it. As, 1. By it the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God is manifeſted that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay hid; Ye may by the preaching of the Goſpel come to the knowledge of the Covenant of Redemption, and of the great deſign that the Lord hath laid down for bringing about the Salvation of loſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Therein is the righteouſneſs of God revealed from Faith to Faith.</hi> 2. By it the Lord revealeth the Duty He calleth for from Men, as well as His Will concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Juſtification and Salvation; He lets them know what is wrong, what is right, what diſpleaſeth Him, and what pleaſeth Him. Yea, 3. By the preaching of the Goſpel, He holdeth out what Mens ability is, or rather what is their inability, and by His external Calling gives them in it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to know this their inability in not giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience to His call; and this is no ſmall advantage, when by it they have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to know the neceſſity of a Mediator, and to ſeek after another way of Juſtication then by their own works; for ſo it proves a notable mean to humble Men, to ſtop
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:152256:70"/> their Mouths, and to make them plead guilty before God. 4. It's profitable as the Lord is pleaſed to make uſe of it, to call and gather in ſo many as He hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to Eternal Life; for though in it ſelf it be not able to convert, yet having the Power of God going along with it, it is the inſtrument of Converſion, and the Lord ordinarily makes uſe of it to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of Faith in them that Believe, as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,</hi> preached; and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. it's called <hi>the power of God to ſalvation;</hi> and, <hi>it hath pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;</hi> for though God can work without it, yet He hath thought good to make uſe of it, to inform the Judgment, and to ſtir up the Affections of Hearers, and ſo it proves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to the begetting of Faith in them. 5. If it do not promove the Salvation of all the Hearers of it, yet it promoves it in all the Elect, and ſerves to make others the more inexcuſable, and in this reſpect it <hi>triumphs always,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15, 16. In ſome it is <hi>the ſavour of life unto life,</hi> in others <hi>the ſavour of death unto death,</hi> leaving them the more inexcuſable, and the more obnoxious to Wrath by their rejecting of the Counſel of God againſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>I know this will be excepted againſt; We come therefore to conſider the ſecond Queſtion, which is this, How can the Call of the Goſpel make Men inexcuſable, ſeing they cannot without the effectual Power of the Grace of God Believe? as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me,</hi> that is, no Man can believe in me, <hi>except the Father who hath ſent me draw him;</hi> yea, why doth God find fault with Men for their Unbelief? for anſwer, it hath been no new thing for Men to ſtart Queſtions and Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Grace of God, and to be always ſtriving to rub affronts and diſgrace upon it, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13, 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where this ſame Objection is ſtarted, and anſwered again and again; for when the Apoſtle hath ſaid <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. Jacob <hi>have I loved, and</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated,</hi> the Objection is moved, <hi>Is there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs with God then?</hi> Folks readily think that there is a ſort of unrighteouſneſs in God when He takes one and leaves ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially conſidering, that the leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the other infers (though it be not any culpable cauſe of) the ruine of the Mans Soul; he anſwers <hi>firſt</hi> with a <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid,</hi> as if it were an abſurd thing ſo to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert; and then endeavours to anſwer it from Gods Soveraignty, as being Debtor to none, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,</hi> and, <hi>it's not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſhews mercy:</hi> In Gods adminiſtration of Grace, He is Debtor to no Man, nor hath He any rule by which He proceedeth, but His own Soveraign Will; and if it ſhall yet be ſaid, if God doth walk by His own Soveraign Will in giving Grace, <hi>Why doth he yet find fault</hi> or condemn, <hi>for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> Why is God angry that Men will not Believe, ſince none can come to Chriſt againſt the Will of God? His Indignation riſeth at this proud and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant Objection, and He anſwers, <hi>But who art thou O man that replieſt againſt God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? hath not the potter power over the clay, to make of the ſame lump, one veſſel to honour, and another to diſhonour?</hi> By the Apoſtle's doubling of this anſwer, and his not ſetting of himſelf to ſatisfie carnal Reaſon and Curioſity, there is ground given to ſilence us here; It's the Lord, He is our Potter, and we the Clay; it's He in whoſe Hand we are, who can do us no wrong, and this may ſufficiently ſerve to put a ſtop to all reaſoning and diſputing againſt Him; Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> we may add a word fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeing the Apoſtle proceeds to another Reaſon; Therefore, 2. Conſider whence it is that this inability to believe or turn to God doth come; not from God ſure; for if He had not made Man perfect, there might be ſome ground for the Objection; but ſeing <hi>He did make man upright, and he hath ſought out many inventions,</hi> who is to be blamed? hath the Lord loſt His right to exact His Debt, becauſe Man hath played the Bankrupt and debauched, and turned Dyvour, and unable to pay? doth not this very objecting prove us guilty, and evidence that we have loſt that which God gave to us, and made us with at the Beginning? When
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:152256:71"/> God made <hi>Adam,</hi> he had power to believe and give God credit as to every word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed or to be revealed, and that now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fall, he and his Poſterity want that power, they have not this privation from Gods creating of them, but from their Fall, they by their Fall utterly incapacitating themſelves for theſe Duties that they owe to God, and for this among the reſt. 3. If there were no more but ſimple inability among them that hear this Goſpel, they might have ſome pretext or ground of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, though it were not any real nor juſt excuſe, as hath been ſhewed, but it never comes to this as the only or main cauſe of their not Believing; There is always ſome maliciouſneſs, perverſneſs, and pravity in the Will; it's not, <hi>I cannot,</hi> but <hi>I will not,</hi> it's a wiful and ſome way deliberate reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, that is the ground of Folks not Beli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ving; and what excuſe, I pray, can ye have, who do not believe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, when it ſhall be found that ye malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and deliberatly chooſed to reject it? To make this out, conſider but theſe few things, 1. Mens neglecting of the very out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, that through Gods bleſſing prove inſtrumental in the begetting of Faith, as of Hearing, Reading, Prayer, Meditation, Self-ſearching, ſtirring up themſelves to Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby the Lord ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily brings about and furthers the work of Faith. 2. Conſider the carnal, careleſs, and lazy manner of Mens going about theſe Means and Duties, which to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction are within the reach of that power which they have; ye might hear oftener and more attentively, ye might pray more frequently and more ſeriouſly then often ye do, ye want even much of that moral ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs in Hearing, Prayer, Reading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ye have in other things of leſs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ye will hear a Proclamation at the Croſs with more attention, then a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, ye will hear a Threatning from Man with more fear then ye will hear a Threatning from God's Word, ye will be more ſerious in ſeeking ſomewhat from Man, then in aſking Grace from God; the reaſon is, becauſe your Heart is more to the one nor to the other; can ye then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally think that ye are excuſable, when Believing is not a thing that is in your Heart, and that takes you up, but ye go about the Means that lead to it unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, careleſly, and negligently? 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how often ye do willingly chooſe ſome other thing then Chriſt, to ſpend your Time, and ſet your Affections upon, laying obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and bars in the way of Gods Grace, ſetting up idols in the Heart, and filling Chriſts room before hand with ſuch things as are inconſiſtent with His Company, and all this is done willingly and deliberately; ye have ſaid in your Hearts as theſe did, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.25. <hi>We have loved ſtrangers, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them we will go;</hi> and will ye, or dare ye make that an excuſe why ye could not come to Chriſt, becauſe your Hearts were taken up with your Luſts and Idols? So then the matter will not hold here. that ye were unable and had not power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but it will come to this, that your Conſcience will have it to ſay, that ye wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and deliberately chooſed to ly ſtill in your Unbelief, and that ye preſerred your Idols to Chriſt Jeſus. 4. Conſider, That ſometimes ye have met with ſome more then an ordinary touch, motion, and work of the Spirit that hath been born in upon you, which ye have ſlighted and neglected, if not quenched and put out, which is your great guilt before the Lord: Is there any of you, but now and then at Preaching, or when in ſome great hazard, or under ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſome other ſad croſs, ye have been under Convictions of Sin, and have had ſome little glances of the hazard ye were in of the Wrath of God, more then ordinarly ye had at other times? and I would aſk you, have theſe been entertained and cheriſhed, or rather have they not been ſlighted and worn out by you? and may ye not in this reſpect be charged with the guilt of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit of God, and marring the work of your own Converſion and Salvation? Theſe things, and many moe, which will cry loud in the Conſciences of Men and Women one day, will quite remove and take away this objection, <hi>that ye could not do better;</hi> Ye might have done better then ye did, ye might have abſtained from many
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:152256:71"/> Evils that ye committed, and done many Duties that ye ommitted, and done them with more moral ſeriouſneſs then ye did; but ye were perverſe, and did willingly and deliberately chooſe to continue in your Natural condition, rejecting Chriſt, and the Offer of Salvation through Him: This alſo ſerves to refute and remove that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Principle or Tenet that many have in their Minds and Mouths, <hi>That they have no more Grace then God hath given them;</hi> will ye dare to come before God in the great Day with any ſuch Objection? no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, or if ye dare, God will aggrege your guilt by it, and beat it back again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Throat; then, O! then all ſuch Subterfuges will be no ſhelter to you before Him, nor in the leaſt able to inſconce your Souls againſt the ſtrong Batteries of the Wrath of God, that will be as a Storm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wall.</p>

            <p>MIniſters have not done with their work when they have preached, and People have not done with their work when they have heard: That which is of greateſt concernment follows, which either hath, in the want of it influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the ſadning of both Miniſters and People, or in the obtaining of it, on their Conſolation: This is the thing that we find <hi>Iſaiah</hi> upon here, who having preached the Goſpel, looks what Fruit it hath, and when he beholds the general unfruitfulneſs it had in his own time, and ſhould have in our time, it weights him exceedingly, and indeed it's very ſad that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſhould be ſo much weighted in foreſeeing the unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Goſpel in our days, and that we our ſelves ſhould be ſo little weighted with it, and ſo ſenſleſs under it.</p>
            <p>He caſts in this word, <hi>To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> partly to confirm the former word, <hi>Who hath believed our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?</hi> and partly to help to make the right uſe of it, by drawing Men to the diſcovery of the Soveraign Hand of God in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of the neceſſity of His Grace for making the Goſpel effectual in the Hearers of it wherever it comes, <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath believed our report?</hi> To whom is this preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Goſpel made effectual for Faith and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? It's but to very few, even to as many as have the Arm of the Lord, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Power of His ſpecial Grace revealed to them, and no moe.</p>
            <p>The laſt <hi>Doctrine</hi> we propoſed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpeak of as the Scope, was, That believing and receiving of the Goſpel, and the Lord's exercing a powerful work of His Grace with it, are ever ſtill knit together; they are of equal extent; as many Believe as He ſtretcheth out His Hand of Power with the Word to work Faith in them, and as many ly ſtill in Unbelief as His Hand of Power is not revealed unto, This is his Scope.</p>
            <p>We took up this <hi>Doctrine</hi> in two Branches, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the moſt powerful Means cannot work nor beget Faith in the Hearers of the Goſpel, except there be an inward power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful work of Grace on their Hearts accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying them; and this we cleared, and

            <p>The ſecond Branch then of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> is, That wherever the Lord applieth the powerful work of His Grace, there neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Faith and Converſion follow; or the ſtretching forth of God's Arm in the work of His Grace, hath always the work of Faith and Converſion, and the engaging of the Soul unto Jeſus Chriſt following on it; and indeed if it be true that we cleared b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fore, to wit, That there are as many Unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as there are Perſons on whom Grace doth not thus powerfully work, or that they are all ſuch that this work of Grace is not manifeſted on, then the work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Believing is as broad as this work of Grace is, for the Prophet maketh them of equal extent, who is he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth? even he to whom the Arm of the Lord is revealed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on the contrary, who is he that believeth not? even he to whom the Arm of the Lord is not revealed, and on whom this work of Grace is not manifeſted. By which we may ſee it to be very clear, that the Prophet hangs the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of the Goſpel on the Lord's mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting His Arm; ſo that where it is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, this work of Faith is not brought forth, and where it is manifeſted, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily it is brought forth.</p>
            <p>This being a <hi>Doctrine</hi> concerning the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of God's Grace, which ought not to ly hid from the Lords People, we ſhall a little, firſt, clear it, and then ſecondly, confirm it to you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For clearing of it's Meaning. 1. Ye would not take up our meaning in it ſo, as if we made every common work that lively means may have on the Hearers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to be Converſion; The preaching of the Word will ſometimes make Folks trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as we ſee in <hi>Felix,</hi> and will waken Convictions and Terrors in them, and put them into an amazement, and yet leave them there; for all theſe Convictions may be, and often are reſiſted, as to any Saving Fruit at leaſt, which we conceive to be that which <hi>Stephen</hi> points at, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. while he ſaith, <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked and uncircumciſed in heart and ears, ye do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, as your fathers did, ſo do ye;</hi> and what he means by this is explained in the words following, <hi>Which of the Prophets have not your fathers perſecuted,</hi> &amp;c. even their contending with the Word of the Lord in the mouths of His Servants: Yea, in that ſame place, where it's ſaid, that <hi>they gnaſhed upon him with their teeth,</hi> it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated that they came over the belly of the cutting Conviction which his Preaching had upon them: Nor do we 2. mean, That every common operation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whether illumination of the Mind, or a touch on the Affections (ſuch as may be in Temporaries and Apoſtates, as is clear <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. and downward) is Converſion; There is a great difference betwixt a common work or gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (which in a large Senſe ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When we ſpeak of an effectual bringing forth of Faith by this Grace of God, we would not have you thinking, that we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe no reluctancy to be in the Man in ſo far as he is unrenewed, for though where Grace effectually worketh, Faith follows neceſſarily, yet Corruption being in the Man, it's diſpoſed and apt to thwart with, and to oppoſe Grace; and the Will hath its averſneſs to yield: But the meaning of the Doctrine is this, That though there be ſuch a ſtrong power of Corruption in the Man to whom Grace comes, and on whom it is put forth, yet the power of Grace is ſuch, that it powerfully maſters and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Corruption, and wins the Heart to believe in, and to engage with Chriſt; though (to ſpeak ſo) there be ſomething within that ſtrives to keep the door ſhut on
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152256:72"/> Chriſt; yet when it comes to that, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.3. <hi>He puts in his fingers by the holl of the lock, and makes the myrrhe to drop;</hi> the Heart is prevailed with ſo, as it is effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened, as the Heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Word that <hi>Paul</hi> preached: Thus, notwithſtanding of Corruptions oppoſition, Grace gains its point, and the Lord never applys His Grace of purpoſe to gain a Soul, but he prevails. 4. When we ſpeak of the power and effectualneſs of Grace in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering and gaining the Heart and Will of the Sinner to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, we do not mean that there is any force or violence done to the Will, or any exerting of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active power, violenting the Will contrary to its eſſential property of freedom, to cloſe with Chriſt; But this we mean, that though Corruption be in the Heart, yet Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infuſed and acted by the Spirit, the pravity in the Will is ſweetly cured, and the Will is moved and made to Will willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and upon choice, by the power of the Spirit of Grace taking in that ſtrong hold; This great work is wrought by an omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſwavity, and by a ſweet omnipotency; and it needs not at all ſeem ſtrange, for if Man in Nature, be, by the power of habitual Corruption, made neceſſarily to will Evil, ſo that notwithſtanding he doth freely and willingly chooſe Evil; why ſhould it be thought ſtrange o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> abſurd to ſay, that when a principle of the Grace of God is infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul, and acted by the Spirit of God, If hath, that much influence, power, and efficacy as to prevail with the Will, it keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill its own freedom, to make it willing to embrace Jeſus Chriſt, and yet not at all thereby wrong that eſſential property of the Will? ſure, Grace is as powerful as Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Lord is as dextrous a worker, and can work as aggreeably to the nature of the Creature in this gracious work, as the Creature can in its own ſinful actings. So then we ſay, when the Lord is pleaſed to apply the work of His Grace to convert a Sinner, that work is never fruſtrated, but it always hath neceſſarily the work of Faith, Renovation, and Converſion following on the back of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ſhall a little confirm the Doctrine, and the grounds of Confirmation are theſe, The 1. whereof is, The expreſs Scriptures wherein this Truth is aſſerted, as <hi>John</hi> 6.44, 45. It is ſaid in the 44. Verſe, <hi>No man can come to me except the Father draw him,</hi> and on the contrary, it is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly ſet down <hi>verſ.</hi> 45. <hi>It is written in the Prophets, they ſhall be all taught of God, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me,</hi> and this being contradiſtinguiſhed to external Preaching, and being that which is called <hi>drawing, v.</hi> 44. he knits Believing to it, and makes Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, called <hi>coming,</hi> a neceſſary effect of it, that to whomſoever God gives that inward Leſſon, they ſhall come; which confirms the Doctrine, that whomſoever the Lord teaches and ſchools by His Grace, and calls effectually, they do neceſſarily Believe. Another paſſage we have <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Work out the work of your ſalvation in fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure;</hi> where the Apoſtle makes the work of Grace not only to work ability to will and to do, but to work alſo to will and to do actually; and Grace never worketh <hi>to will,</hi> and leaves the Man unwilling, but neceſſarily ſuppoſeth the Man's cloſing willingly with Chriſt, with whom He worketh thus. A 2. Ground of confirmation is drawen from theſe Expreſſions whereby this work is ſet forth, and the Promiſes comprehending it in God's Covenant, wherein it's called the <hi>giving of a new heart, a heart of fleſh, the writing of the law in the heart, the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his Spirit within his people, and cauſing them to walk in his ſtatutes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. and it is impoſſible to conceive aright of the fulfilling of theſe Promiſes without the including of the effect; the giving of the new Heart, is not only a perſwading to Believe, but the actual giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the new Heart, whereof Faith is a ſpecial part, which Promiſe is peculiar to the Elect, though the offer of it be more large, and be further extended; and what can that Promiſe of Gods writing the Law in the Heart be, but an effectual inclining
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:152256:73"/> of the Heart to the Will of God? or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward renovation contradiſtinguiſhed to the external Miniſtry, that can only hold out His Will in a Book, and ſpeak it to the Ear. 3. This may be cleared and confirmed from the nature of the work of Grace, which is ſuch a mighty work and ſo powerful, as it is impoſſible it can be fruſtrated or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; unleſs we could ſay that Grace in God, or the Grace of God is not ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as Corruption in us, which were Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy; to this purpoſe the Apoſtle pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in behalf of the Chriſtian <hi>Epheſians, chap.</hi> 1.19, 20. that they may know <hi>what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead;</hi> he ſpeaketh ſo in this high ſtrain, to ſet out both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſtubbornneſs of our Nature that needs ſuch a work, and the exceeding great power of the Grace of God that worketh irreſiſtably, not only in the Converſion of the Elect at firſt, but in all the after-acts of Believing, ſo <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.7. the ſame Apoſtle hath it, —<hi>according to the gift of the Grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power;</hi> and <hi>Col.</hi> 1.29. <hi>according to his working which worketh in me mightily;</hi> The Power that worketh in Believers is Gods omnipotent Power, which worketh effectually and mightily; and if this Power be exerciſed in the continuing and promov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith, as is ſaid before, it muſt be much more exerciſed in the begetting of Faith; yea, and what need is there that He ſhould exerciſe it, if not for this end, that where He exerciſeth it, it may alſo prevail? A 4th. ground of Confirmation may be drawen from the Lords great end which He hath before Him in this work, and that is the gaining of glory to His Grace, and to have the whole work of Converſion attributed to it; and if this be His end, He muſt and will prevail by His Grace in throughing the work in order to this end; if it were left indifferent to Man to yield o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not to yield to God as he pleaſeth, the whole weight of the work of Converſion ſhould not ly upon Grace, Mans Mouth ſhould not be ſtopped, but when that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſhould be aſked, <hi>who hath made thee to differ, and what haſt thou O man, but what thou haſt received?</hi> he ſhould ſtill have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to boaſt of, and the work of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, ſhould at beſt be halfed betwixt Grace and his own Free-will; this would neceſſarily follow if Grace did not through the work, and ſo God ſhould miſs of His end. A 5th. ground of Confirmation is taken from the conſideration of Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, of the Covenant of Redemption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Jehovah and the Mediator, and of the Power and Wiſdom of God in carrying on this work, which we put together for brevities cauſe; From all which it will be clear, that there is, and muſt be a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry connexion betwixt the work of Grace on Believers and the Effect, and that it is not in the power of Mans Free-will to reſiſt it, which indeed is not freedom but bondage. 1. Then, We ſay, That if we conſider the Decree of Election, we will find that where Grace is applied, Faith and Converſion muſt follow; otherwiſe, if the work of Grace were not effectual to convert, Gods Decree ſhould be ſuſpended on the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Free-will, and be effectual or not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual according as it pleaſed, and is that any little matter to make His Decree de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon, and be effectual or not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Man's pleaſure? that which ſicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth His Decree and makes it infruſtrably to take effect, is, that He hath effectual Means to bring about His Decree. 2: If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Covenant of Redemption, betwixt Jehovah and the Mediator, we will find that upon the one ſide the Mediator particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertaketh for them that are given to Him, that He ſhall loſs none of them; and upon the other ſide, we have (to ſpeak with reverence of the Majeſty of God after the manner of Men) the Father's Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make ſuch Perſons in due time Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that Chriſt the Mediator may ſee of the travel of His Soul and be ſatisfied, according to that Promiſe made to Him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>In the day of thy power thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhal be willing;</hi> and that other, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul and be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant juſtifie many,</hi> &amp;c. and accordingly Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:152256:73"/> ſaith, <hi>John.</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father hath given to me ſhall come unto me,</hi> where it is clear, that theſe who are given muſt neceſſarily come: and He alſo ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 10.16. <hi>Other ſheep have I, which are not of this ſold, them alſo I muſt bring;</hi> and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppoſed without horrour and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, that this determinate, ſolid, and ſure tranſaction, having all its midſes includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, and being as to its end ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, ſhall as to theſe midſes and that end, and as to their throughing, not be in Gods hand, but in the hand of Mans Free-will? if it were there, O! how unſicker and looſe would the bargain and God's deſign in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting Faith, and in bringing Souls through Grace to Glory be! 3. If we conſider the Lords Power in beginning and promoving, and His Wiſdom in carrying on of this work, His Power whereby he raiſeth the Dead, and His Wiſdom whereby He leads from Death to Life; is it poſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or imagine theſe to be applied by the Lord in the Converſion of a Sinner, but this Doctrine muſt needs hold, that the work of His Grace powerfully applied, hath always Faith and Converſion following on it, and that the Lord leaveth it not to the option of Elect Souls, to believe, or not to believe as they pleaſe? He muſt not, He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fruſtrate of His end and deſign, but He muſt bring them to a cordial cloſure with Chriſt by Faith in order to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. The firſt Uſe ſerves to fix you in the Faith of this great Truth, and though we uſe not, neither is it needful to trouble you with long Queſtions and Debates; yet when the like of this Doctrine comes in our way, eſpecially in ſuch a time, wherein the pure Truths of God, and this among the reſt, are troubled and called in queſtion, it is requiſite that a word be ſpoken for your confirmation and eſtabliſhment; and we would hence have you fixed in the Faith of theſe two. 1. Of the impotency of Nature in the beginning or promoving ought of the work of Grace, which belongs to the firſt branch of the Doctrine. 2. Of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectualneſs and irreſiſtableneſs of Grace, that wherever God begets and brings in a Soul, He does it by His own powerful Grace, and wherever He applies that work, Faith and Converſion neceſſarily follow, which belongs to the ſecond branch of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and we would the rather ſpeak a little to this, becauſe it is queſtioned by the Enemies of the Grace of God, then which, there is nothing they ſet themſelves more to dethrone and debaſe, and to exalt and cry up Nature and Free-will, as if it did ſit on the Throne, and Grace behoved to come and ſupplicate it, and as if it might accept or reject its Bill at pleaſure as to the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Sinner; In oppoſition to which, this Doctrine holds good, that wherever the Lord applies His Grace, He effectually throughs the work of Faith and Converſion, and there is no Soul that can utterly reſiſt it; and wherever the Lord applies this Grace, the Grace that converts one cannot be fruſtrated by another; Theſe things we hold in oppoſition to the direct aſſertion of the Enemies of Grace, whereby they make the work of Converſion, not ultimatly to terminate on Grace, but on Man's Free-will, and how dangerous and damnable this Error is, may eaſily appear, For 1. It over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns and runs croſs to the whole ſtrain of the Goſpel, for if we looſe but this one Pin, in making Faith and Converſion not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Grace, but on Free-will, then the whole Fabrick of Grace falls down flat; then God ſhould elect us, becauſe we were to elect Him, contrary to the Scripture, which tells us, that He elects us, not we Him; and that our cloſing with Him by Faith, depends on His electing of us: It overturns our free Juſtification by Grace, for ſuppoſing Faith comes in in Juſtification, as it doth, none being juſtified but by Faith, and that Believing is of our ſelves, and that it is in the power of Man's Free-will to cloſe the Bargain, all is not here of Grace, our Juſtification is not free, but ſome-way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on Free-will: It overturns the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance of the Saints; for if Believing depend on Free-will, then our Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance depends on it alſo, for if the Mans Free-will change, he may fall back and break his neck in a manner, at the very threſhold of Heaven; whereas if it be the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:152256:74"/> work of Grace (as indeed it is) that brings forth Faith, and carries it on, and if this work of Grace cannot be fruſtrated or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the malice and hardneſs of any Heart to which it is applied, becauſe it cures the hardneſs and removes that malice; then certainly this Error cannot ſtand; and we are perſwaded when we plead thus for Grace, we have the beſt end of the Debate, and the ſureſt Ground to go upon, moſt for God's Honour, and moſt for the comfort of Believers. 2. This Error thwarts with the Glory of the Grace of God; for it is an Error that ſtrikes at the richeſt and moſt radiant Diamond of the Crown of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt, it hangs Election and the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualneſs of God's Decree as to effectual Calling, Faith, Juſtification, and Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance on the Perſon himſelf, and makes God and Chriſt to be in the Man's common debt, and reverence, to make His Decree effectual, whereas it is the glory of Grace to have all Fleſh allanarly in its debt and common, as having loved freely, elected, called, juſtified, ſanctified, and carried on the work of Grace til it end and be perfected in Glory, freely; which is the Song of the redeemed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Unto him who hath loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and prieſts unto God and his Father, to him be glory and dominion;</hi> If eternal love be free, then the expreſſion or manifeſtation of it in making us Kings and Prieſts unto God, is alſo free, 3. This Error is exceeding deſtructive to the conſolation of God's People; Is it not a comfortleſs Doctrine that founds their Believing and Perſeverance on their own Free-will? if ye were to make the bargain of Grace, whether would ye think it more comfortable and ſure, that the effectualneſs of Believing and Perſeverance ſhould hang on the Grace of God, or on your own Free-will? eſpecially conſidering the pravity of your Will; doleful would your condition be, if Free-will were the Baſe or Foundation, and God uſed no more but external per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion: how ſpecious ſoever this opinion ſeem to be, becauſe it puts it in Mans option to believe and convert himſelf, or not, as he pleaſeth; yet it overturns the whole ſtrain of the Goſpel, and quite eclipſeth the glory of Grace, and cuts the very throat of your Conſolation, and is the great ground of <hi>Popery, Pelagianiſm,</hi> and <hi>Arminianiſm;</hi> to which ye would therefore ſo much the more advert, and we do the rather ſpeak to it, that ye may be guarded againſt it, and that ye may be ſetled in the Truth, eſpecially ſince the ſame Errors are a-reviving in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhape in theſe days, as is manifeſt in that foolry of <hi>Quakers,</hi> who talk of a Light within them, and talk ſo of that Light as if it were of power ſufficient to convert and guide them, if it be not reſiſted. As alſo that other conceit of being above Ordinances, implys ſomething of this ſame Error; which ye would ſet your ſelves to abhor, as that which the Devil is again labouring to ſow the Seed of amongſt us, and labour to be confirmed in the Truth: For if there be any truth at all in Chriſtianity, theſe are two main Truths, the utter inability that is in Mens Hearts by Nature to exerciſe Faith in Chriſt, and the efficacious and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible power of the Grace of God, in the begetting of Faith where it is begotten; which when we ſhall all appear before the Tribunal of God, will be found to be ſo, and none will have a Mouth opened to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them. And what abſurdity, I pray, is there here, notwithſtanding all the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of corrupt Men? that God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this work of converting Sinners by His Grace to Himſelf, and hath not put it in the hand of their own Free-will; which ſuppoſeth Men to have a ſtock within themſelves, and hath many fearful effects following it, tending to the depreciating of the Grace of God, and to the drawing Men off from dependance on Chriſt, and to the giving of them ground of boaſting in themſelves, and of vanity and ſecurity, all which this Doctrine of Gods Grace over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws, and ſtops the Mouth of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from all vain boaſting, to the high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of Gods free, ſoveraign, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious Grace, and to the great comfort of His People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. The ſecond Uſe ſerves to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Grace of God to the Hearers of the Goſpel, and eſpecially to Believers;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:152256:74"/> There cannot be a greater commendation given to it, than this, that it works effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, and indeed it could not be called Grace, I mean, Saving Grace, if it ſhould want this effect, even to ſave ſuch as it is applied to; but this highly commends Grace, that if, there be mighty Corruption in us, there is a ſtrong arm of Grace put forth by Him for perfiting of that which concerns us, notwithſtanding of this great ſtrength of Corruption. And if ye think your ſelves not to be Believers, and think this Doctrine to be hard, that ye cannot Believe without this Grace, and yet would fain Believe, conſider that as none can believe, neither can Believers ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace; ſo Grace can help you to do that which ye cannot do, which is the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Grace, and ſhould make it more lovely to you; this gives encouragement to any poor Soul that is as it were in the place of the breaking forth of Children, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth greater ground of confidence that they ſhall come ſpeed, than if they had it in their own hand; and ſerves to obviat that grand objection of Souls that would fain be at cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Chriſt, and cannot come to Him, here is a powerful Arm reached forth to draw them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. The third Uſe ſerves to humble Believers who have any thing of the work of Grace, and ſo, to work them up to thankfulneſs to Him that hath communicate ought of it to them: Is there any of you that have Grace, who hath made you to differ from others? it was not your ſelves but free Grace, and therefore ye have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to acknowledge it with thankfulneſs, and to ſay, if this ſame Doctrine had not been true, I would have been a ſtranger to God all my days, and remained under the dominion of Satan and Sin with theſe that are in Nature; and with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 16.7. to ſay, <hi>I bleſs the Lord who hath given me counſel, my reins alſo instruct me in the night ſeaſons;</hi> This counſel was not the common advice that all got from the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the inward counſel of the Spirit that made his reins Inſtruct him, and made him inwardly to follow the advice that the Word gave him outwardly; and it is this inward work of the Spirit that keeps in the life of Grace, as well as begets it, as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.23, 24. <hi>Nevertheleſs I am continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with thee, thou haſt holden me by my right hand, thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſel, and afterward receive me to glory; whom have I in heaven but thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>my fleſh and my heart faileth, but God is the ſtrength of my heart and my portion for ever:</hi> the Pſalmiſt glorieth in this, that the work of his throw-bearing, did not depend on his own fleſh and heart, but on God, who was the ſtrength of his heart and his portion for ever: If Believers would conſider what they were in their natural condition, and how much they are obliged to the Grace of God, that with power was applied in their Converſion, it would ſtop their Mouth as to boaſting, make them admire Grace, and ſound forth its praiſe: And they would think Graces ſweet way of prevailing, to be no co-active forcing of their Will, but the greateſt part of their freedom; and ſo far would it be from being look'd on as a violenting or wronging of their Will, that it would be eſteemed their trueſt and greateſt liberty: We are perſwaded that the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven count it no bondage that God hath ſo fully fred them from all Corruption, that they ſerve Him with delight, and do ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily; and ſhall any ſojourning-Saints here below, count it a wronging of their Will, that God takes ſuch pains on them, to ſubdue Corruption, and to bring them to ſome meaſure of conformity to them who are above? God forbid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. The fourth Uſe of it is, To let us ſee, what great ground of encouragement there is here for the Hearers of the Goſpel, to ſet about the work of Believing, and what ground there is to make them all ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inexcuſable who ſhall continue in their Unbelief; which may be thought ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrange, when we ſay that no means can be effectual for working of Faith, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the effectual Grace of God be applied; But let theſe two be put together, 1. That though we be inſufficient of our ſelves, and though all outward means be of themſelves ineffectual, that yet there is a ſufficiency in the Grace of God: And 2. That this Grace
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:152256:75"/> ſhall be powerful to work Faith in the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel, if they make not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of fruſtrating this Grace in the offer of it (as they may do); Theſe then who will not believe, will be found moſt inexcuſable. But to return to the main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this <hi>Uſe,</hi> We ſay, that the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement lies here, that though we be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, we have an able Mediator, and Grace is powerful; and therefore we ſhould with the greater encouragement ſet about the work of Believing, as the Apoſtle reaſons, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling, for it's God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure:</hi> Ye might poſſibly think it had been more encouraging to have ſaid, ye are able of your ſelves to will and to do; but certainly, Grace is a more encouraging motive then any thing in the Creature; ſay not then, ye cannot will nor do, for that excuſe is taken away by God's offering to work both in you by His Grace; But let me exhort all, both theſe that are begun to be Believers, and theſe that are to begin to believe, to be ſo far from diſputing themſelves from it, as that they rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage themſelves to work out the work of their own Salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, becauſe God's Grace which ye have in your offer, is ſo powerful to work the work, and will admit of no utter oppoſition from Corruption in you, if ye receive not the Grace of God in vain that is offered to you in the Goſpel: If Grace were ſo weak as we might caſt it back at our pleaſure, and if it were but a helper in the work of Faith and Converſion, as <hi>Arminians</hi> make it, what encouragement could we have from it? and as to Practice, is not this Doctrine as encouraging? what advantage or comfort is it to undertake any thing in our own ſtrength, which is none at all? is not this much more encouraging, to undertake in the ſtrength of Gods Grace? knowing that the ſame work of Grace that begets Faith, is as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to carry it on, and to make us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in it, and to enable us to every good word and work; let Grace work then, and take a proof of it, and ye ſhall find it power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: The Lord Himſelf give you wiſdom ſo to do for your Salvation and Conſolation.</p>

            <p>IT's much to walk evenly and ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the pure Doctrine of Grace, and neither there-from to take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to give way to looſneſs and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal liberty, nor to become faint and diſcouraged, and fearful at the way of God; corrupt Nature is ready to abuſe the beſt things: That word which we have 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. that there are many <hi>that wreſt and pervert the Scriptures to their own deſtruction,</hi> holds true, not only of doctrinal Hereſies, but it holds alſo true in reſpect of Mens Practice, or practical Errours; for ſome hearing of the impotency of Nature, and of the power and perfection of Grace in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about its deſigned effect, are ready to think that they need to do nothing, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if Grace undertake the work it will be wrought, and if not, it will not be wrought; and thus Atheiſm and Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſteal in ſecretly upon the Heart, and the ſweet Doctrine of Grace is abuſed and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:152256:75"/> perverted by ſuch, to their own deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: There are others again, who it may be will not dare ſo to top with God, who yet have their own fainting and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when they hear of this Doctrine, and think it hard that they themſelves can do nothing, and fear that they will never win to believe, becauſe they cannot do it of themſelves, theſe alſo fail, and make not the right uſe of Grace.</p>
            <p>Ye remember, the <hi>Queſtion</hi> which we propoſed to ſpeak a little to on the laſt Doctrine, to wit, That ſeing both theſe branches of it are true, That except Grace concur, the moſt powerful preaching of the Goſpel will not beget Faith; and that wherever the work of Grace goes along with the Goſpel, there Faith is begotten; what is called for from the Hearers of the Goſpel as the <hi>Uſe</hi> of this Doctrine?</p>

               </gap>fore we come to anſwer this Queſtion more particularly, we would 1. Premit this word in general, That none would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Preaching or Hearing of the Word of God to be uſeleſs or fruitleſs, albeit that without the work of Grace, Men cannot yield the Fruit which it call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th for from them; for our bleſſed <hi>Lord Jeſus, Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> preached this Doctrine of Grace, and the neceſſity of the Lords Arm to be revealed in the Converſion of Souls, and yet they taught the Word in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, and were gathering in ſome, and to ſome this Doctrine was made the ſavour of life unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ife, though to others (through their enmity and corruption) it became the ſavour of death unto death: To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, the inconſiſtency, or to deny the conſiſtency of theſe two, to wit, Of the neceſſity of Preaching the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Grace, and of the preſſing in Preaching the practice of holy Duties, and the uſe of ordinary appointed M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ans, would reach this dreadful length, even to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Prophets of old, yea, and our bleſſed Lord Jeſus Himſelf who ſays, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. after He h d preached long, <hi>No man can come to me ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But ſecondly, We ſhall a little more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in anſwer to the Queſtion, ſpeak <hi>Firſt,</hi> To what <hi>Uſes</hi> Folk would not make of this Doctrine, or what things they would abſtain from, as tending to a wrong uſe of it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To ſome Conſiderations for preſſing this Doctrine, and removing from it the conſtruction of hardneſs that we are ready to put upon it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To what is the native <hi>Uſe</hi> it calls for; And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> to ſome Conſiderations to preſs this.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> When we ſay to all that hears this Goſpel that there is a neceſſity of a powerful work of Grace ere this Word can be profitable, ye would 1. Abſtain from, and lay aſide curioſity in ſeeking ſatisfying Anſwers to all theſe Objections that are moved againſt it, and abſurdities that it's loaded with by the Devil and Mans proud Nature, and learn to ſtoop to, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the ſoveraign Dominion of God, and His deep and unſearchable Wiſdom and Knowledge, in this ſoveraign way of His Grace, as the Apoſtle doth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God, how unſearchable are his judgments and his ways paſt finding out?</hi> ye would alſo conſider that other word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20. <hi>Who art thou that replieſt against God?</hi> or expoſtulateth with Him, <hi>Shall the thing formed, ſay to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus?</hi> It's good to enquire and to ſeek to know the uſe the Lord calls for of this Doctrine with ſobriety; but there is an enquiring to ſatisfie curioſity which the Lord abhorreth, as we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Exod.</hi> 19 21. where the Lord being to deliver His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:152256:76"/> the Lord to gaze, and many of them periſh:</hi> The Lord is not diſpleaſed that His People ſhould endeavour to behold, and take Him up aright, but when their end is not good, but to ſatisfie an itch of Curioſity, it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth Him: This may be uſeful in many caſes, and particularly in this we have in hand, to teach us ſobriety in ſeeking to know the way of God's Grace, as the Lord would have His People, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. waiting for as much of His Mind as He thought fit to acquaint them with, and to write on the two Tables of Stone, but He would not have them breaking in over the Boundary or March which He did ſet to them, leſt He ſhould break thorow on them, and they ſhould be made to periſh; So would He have Men in their ſtudying the knowledge of His Ways, and particularly of the way of His Grace, to keep His Meaſures, and to contain themſelves within the limits that He pleaſeth to ſet to them. 2. Abſtain from carnal freting at, and expoſtulating with the way of God, whether in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of upbraiding Grace and ſnarling at it, that ye ſhould not have the Stock in your own hand; or in an inferior degree, having a Heart inwardly diſcontent, that ye are not more able of your ſelves then ye are, to believe, which is the thing that the Apoſtle oppoſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20, 21. <hi>Should the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay.</hi> &amp;c. eſpecially ſince none can anſwer that queſtion with any juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon God; who is to be blamed for that defect or inability? or whence did that inability or defect in Mans Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed? God was gracious, free and liberal in making Man perfect, and whoſe Fault is it that it is otherways? 3. Abſtain from, and beware of drawing deſperate concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as to the giving over the uſe of the Means, or of becoming more lazy and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in the duties of Holineſs, and in the practice of Piety, becauſe of the neceſſity of this Grace; but on the contrary, be the more diligent and ſerious, that ye have ſo much need of Grace, and that of your ſelves ye can do ſo little, or rather nothing that is truly good without it.</p>
            <p>I know that prophane Hearts are very fertile and broody of Arguments to plead this point of neglect of Means, and will readily ſay, what is the fruit of diligence, and the prejudice of lazineſs? the one will do us no good, and the other can do us no ill, ſeing it's Grace that doth all the work: But 1. By your lazineſs ye mar your own fruitfulneſs, and that through your own fault, and make this addition to your guilt, that ye not only continue graceleſs, but do ſo through your ſin wilfully. 2. Ye may draw on to your natural impotency, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and judicial hardneſs of Heart, and blindneſs of Mind; it's on this very ground that many Ears are made heavy, many Eyes made blind, and many Hearts made fat, and is that a little or light matter? 3. Though ye may think this little, yet that which will bear the weight of your ſentence at the Day of Judgment, will not be your natural impotency, or that G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ace was not made ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious to y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ur Converſion, but this will be it, that when God ſent out His Word to win you, and offered His Grace for inabling you to yield, ye did maliciouſly and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratly reject it. So that it will never be ſuffered to come to this, I was unable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Word was wilfully rejected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came to this.</p>
            <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> Becauſe there are ſome others poſſibly that have more ſeriouſneſs in the uſe of Means, who, though they dare not quarrel with Grace, yet it weights and diſcour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ges them becauſe they can do ſo little, and they are made heartleſs to eſſay, and hopeleſs to come ſpeed, and it may be, that this is in ſome whom the Lord allows not to draw any ſuch concluſion, but would rather have encouraged; we would ſay to ſuch, that they would beware of fainting or being diſcouraged, as if that were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to God and His Grace which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to them; they would by all means beware of ſitting up, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ackning their hand in Duty, becauſe they can do ſo little: We know there are ſome that need not much to be ſpoken to for ſatisfying of them in this point, but there are others who are weighted with this Doctrine, to whom the Lord allows more tender uſage, and would
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:152256:76"/> not have them to faint nor be diſcouraged; you that are ſuch (if any be) may know that there is ground for us to preſs this, and that we may remove the conſtruction of hardneſs from this ſoveraign way of Gods Grace, wherein He hath thought fit to draw Men unto an abſolute dependance on Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: In the diſpenſing of it, we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe few Conſiderations, 1. That (which was hinted at before) never a Man that hath heard this Goſpel when he comes to count with God, ſhall have it to ſay, that the reaſon why he did not receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, was his impotency and inability, but the real reaſon ſhall be found to be his wilful rejecting of it; and upon the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it ſhall be found, that there was never one that would in earneſt have had ſtrength to run the way of Gods Commandments, and Faith to grip to, and embrace Jeſus Chriſt offered in this Goſpel, that for want of ability came ſhort; and if ſo, what reaſon is there to complain? if none want Faith but ſuch as would not have Him, and if none that would have Him can complain of their want of Him, upon theſe two we have great ground of encouragement to them that have a ſincere affection to be at Him, and there is no ground for Folk to ſit up or fall lazy in purſuing after union and communion with Him in the uſe of Means: None ſhall have cauſe to complain of their want of Him, but ſuch as with their own conſent gave Him over; and any that would fain have had Him, ſhall not miſs Him; for this real willingneſs to cloſe with Chriſt, being a work of the Grace of God, and it being no leſs power that works this Will, than the power which doth effectuate the work of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and bring it to perfection; He that begins the work will perfect it according to His Promiſe, ſeing there is nothing that He does begin but He does perfect it; and therefore in this caſe, Folk had more need to reflect upon their willingneſs to have Chriſt, and to cloſe with Him on His own terms, than to diſpute their impotency and inability. 2. Conſider what they have been whom the Lord hath brought thorow, were they not ſuch as had as much need of Grace as ye have? had they not the ſame corrupt Nature that ye have? were they not as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent and unable to do for themſelves? could any of themſelves do more than ye can? conſider them all that are before the Throne, was it not this ſame Grace of God and not their good Nature nor their Free-will that did the work? and they were not expreſsly or by name included in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes more than ye are; and ye are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly excluded more than they were; the Lord brought forward the work of Grace in them that ſame way that He dealeth with you; by the preaching of His Word He brought them firſt to know their ſinfulneſs, impotency, and weakneſs, to know that there was need of a Saviour, that their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was not of themſelves, neither was it in them to make right uſe of the Saviour and Salvation offered, but in the power of His Grace, and what if He be doing ſo to thee? and if that condition be hard and hopeleſs now, it had been a hopeleſs and hard condition to theſe many that are now before the Throne. 3. Conſider, That there is no queſtion but Grace is effectual to carry on the work, and to make it go thorow; all the difficulty and diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, becauſe God keeps the application in His own Hand, which the Man's Heart would have in its Hand, and which of them do ye think is moſt ſure and encouraging? all your fainting and diſcouragement reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this, becauſe ye can do ſo little; If ye be in good earneſt deſirous to have Grace throughing the work of Faith and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, would ye poſſibly make choiſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or better Hand than God's to put it in? is it not as ſuitable and ſure, that His Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould contrive and lay down the way, as it is to His Power to ſet it forward, and to the freedom of His Grace to make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, and all more ſuitable and ſure than if it were in your own Hand? may ye not think ſhame to be diſcouraged on this ground, becauſe any thing ye do ye muſt needs get it from God, and that that ſhould be an obſtruction in the way of Godlineſs, which is a main encouragement to it? is the Lord an upbraider? is there any that can quarrel Him as nigardly in diſpenſing of His Grace? <hi>doth he not give to all men libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:152256:77"/> and upbraideth no man?</hi> and doth it not become Him well to have the conduct and guiding of His own Grace? 4. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how many the Lord hath given Grace to already, and how He hath given it free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſurprizingly, and unexpectedly; if ye could bring forth any proof that never one got good of God, ye might have a pretext for your diſcouragement and ſcarring, but when as many as are before the Throne are pooofs of His being gracious to Sinners, when ſo many have gotten good of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; and when there are ſeveral who to your own certain knowledge, are dayly get<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eve as ye are, and as much fainted and diſcouraged as ye are; and when He ſays that <hi>He is found of them that ſought him not;</hi> is it not as likly that a poor Body that is longing for His Grace ſhall be ſatisfied as well now as ever? according to that word <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt for righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled;</hi> the Soul that would fain have Holineſs ſhall get it: I know there will be a buſineſs made here, and an new Objection ſtarted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this longing or hunger be real or not? but if your longing and hunger be not real, it will not trouble you much to want; and it is not to encourage or comfort ſuch that have no real longing, that all this is ſpoken; we know there is more need to make ſome vomit up the conceit of their ability, than to encourage them againſt any ſeen and felt inability; There are many alace! that think little of the Grace of God, with whom the error anent Univerſal Grace would aggree well, they having a preſumptuous conceit of Faith, and that it is not ſo difficult a thing to believe as is alledged; we muſt profeſs that we have not much to ſay to ſuch for their encouragement, only we would let them know, that there is a time coming when God will refute and ſilence them: But as for ſuch as ſee their inability, and are put to any meaſure of ſuitable ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and longing in earneſt after Believing, the Lord allows that they be ſtrengthened and encouraged, and to ſuch we would ſay this, If their miſſing of Jeſus Chriſt weight them, if it be their burden that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Believe, and if their longing, hunger, and thirſt be ſome pain and piece of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe to them, ſo as other things reliſh not with them, they are ſo taken up with that; and if they had their Souls choice, it would be this, even a ſatisfying fight of union and communion with Him; their longing and hunger is real, and we may turn over that juſt now cited word to them, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirst after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled;</hi> this hunger and thirſt was never begotten without ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Phyſick from Chriſt the great Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, who hath proviſion for ſatisfying it, and as we uſe to ſay, of the natural Life, He ſent never the Mouth but He ſent the Meat with it, ſo we may ſay of this hunger, He that gives this ſpiritual Mouth, gives always the Meat with it; would to God there were many enlarged Apetites to receive, our Lord would no doubt be found ready to ſatisfie them all; if the Mouth were wide opened, the Affections enlarged, and the Soul ſick under hunger and chirſt for Chriſt and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that Sickneſs ſhould not be found to be unto Death, but to the glory of the Grace of Him who is the great Healer.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>third</hi> thing that we propoſed, to wit, That ſeing there are many ways how Folk may go wrong, and yet none ſhould give over hope, what is the native uſe and exerciſe that this Doctrine calls for? I ſhall ſpeak to this, firſt in general, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in ſome few ſteps or particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. 1. Then in general, ye would conſider that place, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Work out the work of your own ſalvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure;</hi> where it is clear, that the exhortation given to them to work out their Salvation is drawen from this ſame Doctrine of the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious work of Gods Grace, working in them to will and to do as the great Motive; God ſaith. He worketh in you to will and to do, therefore work ye out the work of your own Salvation: There are in this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral exhortation four things implyed, the firſt is the very entry or beginning of the work of Salvation, that is, the exerciſing of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:152256:77"/> Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, it is of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>work</hi> at that work, as if He ſaid, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to the ſaving of your Souls, as the word is <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. ult. <hi>For it's God that works the will in you.</hi> The ſecond is the work of Repentance, this is alſo taken in here, for his bidding them <hi>work in fear and trembling,</hi> reſpects their ſinfulneſs, and neceſſarly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth Repentance. The third is their aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at perfection in Holineſs, the putting forth themſelves in improving of all Means, and in the exerciſing of all Duties for that end, work <hi>out</hi> ſays He. And fourthly, It looks to the manner, that it be not carnally or in carnal confidence, <hi>but with fear and trembling;</hi> and if it ſhould be aſked, how doth that concluſion flow from this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it's Gods work, or He works in you to will and to do, therefore work ye out your Salvation? Folk would rather think that the concluſion ſhould be, ſince God doth all this, do ye nothing: No, but the juſt contrary concluſion is drawen and it hangs on theſe two. 1. On the efficacy of Grace. it's God that works to will and to do, it's His Grace that ſtrengtheneth you, and where. He works the will, He works the deed, where He begins a work, He will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo through and effectuate it, therefore take ye encouragement to work; as if He had ſaid, fight well, for ye have a brave ſecond, though it be not proper to call Grace a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; ſet your ſelves to the exerciſe of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in earneſt, and God wil make it go with you. 2. On the conſideration of ſinfulneſs and weakneſs in them, which ſhould make them work in fear and trembling, as if He had ſ id, ſeing it is God, and the efficacy of His Grace that doth the work be not ye vain and preſumptuous; the firſt part ſays, it's God that works and not ye, therefore be ye the more holily confident; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part ſays, it's not ye but God, and therefore do the work with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; and both tend to this, that Folk would be ſerious in minding and proſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of their Salvation from the firſt ſtep to the laſt, in fear and trembling, on this ground, that though they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in themſelves, yet there is enough in God and in His Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce to do their turn: How is it then, or what can be the reaſon, that we in our Hearts do draw the juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary concluſion to that which the Spirit of God draws here from this ground? when we have the offer of Grace, and hear of the power and efficacy of it, it ſhould as to our part provoke us to be more buſie, reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus with our ſelves, that though our Corruption will ſoon overcome us, yet it wi l not, it cannot overcome Grace; and though the exerciſe of Faith be above our reach, yet it is not above the reach of Grace, though we be weak, yet Grace is ſtrong, and therefore we will work it out: And upon the other ſide, we ought to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inue humble, and in fear and trembling work it out, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cauſe it's not we but Grace that doth the work: If Grace were well conſidered, there is nothing that would more ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngthen Folks hands to work; and upon the other hand, there is nothing that would make Folks more watchful, and to walk in holy fear, conſidering that we are poor Beggers, and thorow our unwatchfulneſs, or conceit and preſumption, may mar the outlettings of His Grace, eſpecially if we grow ſecure, and ungrately forget what we receive from Him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I come now to ſome ſteps or particular directions implied in this <hi>Uſe,</hi> becauſe it will be aſked, What then ſhould Folk do? And before I touch on particulars, take theſe two Cave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ither can ye do any thing of your ſelves that is a gracious act or deed. 2. That we underſtand not that any thing can be done by Men in their Natural ſtate, that doth infer or procure, and far leſs deſerve the giving of Grace to any; but ſeing God hath given direction to us how to walk in order to the working out of our Salvation, we ſay 1. That it's ſafe to us to walk in the way He hath directed us to walk in, and in the uſe of the Means He hath preſcribed, and much more ſafe then to lay them aſide. 2. That there is greater ſuitableneſs betwixt the uſe of the Means, and the finding of Grace, then there is betwixt the neglect of Means and the finding of it. 3. That it aggrees well with Gods way in bringing about the Converſion of Sinners, to bring them piece and piece forward; ſometimes
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:152256:78"/> bringing them to the uſe of external Means, and to the performance of outward Duties, ſometimes convincing them of Sin, and letting them ſee their need of Chriſt; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſcovering the worth that is in Chriſt, and bringing them to fall in love with Him, ere they actually cloſe with Him; and making them in their practice to follow any peep or glimmering of light that is let out to them, and to go the length that light diſcovereth the way and makes it plain as to their duty.</p>
            <p>Now for particular Directions, we would 1. Bid you ſtudy to be fixed and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Faith of theſe general Truths that relate to Mans Sinfulneſs and Miſery, and Inſufficiency in Himſelf, <hi>that in us, that is, in ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Content not your ſelves with a general Faith of the tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h of this Doctrine, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be ſuitably affected with theſe things that ye believe; and though every affectedneſs be not ſpecial Grace, yet I ſpeak to them that are ready to lay the blame and fault on the Grace of God, and yet were never affected with their own graceleſneſs: Ye would ſtudy to be affected with the graceleſneſs of your Nature, and let it put you to ſome ſanctified diſquiet and trouble, till with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> ye be made <hi>to ſmite upon your thigh,</hi> and till ye be put to a holy deliberation and conſultation about your own condition; a Man that is under the hazard of a civil penalty, will think on it again and again, it will affect him, and he will not be at reſt till he be without the reach of it; much more ſhould ye be with the hazard that your Souls are in through Sin; ye are not excuſable, ſo long as ye come not this length. 3. Add to this, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in the uſe of all outward Means and Duties, whereby, and wherein the Lord uſeth to communicate His Grace, <hi>abounding always in the work of the Lord,</hi> as the Apoſtle exhorteth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. Be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in ſecret Prayer, Reading, Meditation, Conference, Self-examination, Hearing, keeping good Company, and the like, which indeed Hypocrites may do, yet they ceaſe not for that to be Duties. 4. Be ſincere and ſerious in the uſe and performance of theſe Means and Duties, that which I mean, is a moral ſincerity and ſeriouſneſs, ſuch as a Man will readily have in a civil Cauſe that he hath depending before a civil Judge, or in hearing of News, or the like, which is a thing that may be, and is often found in Men that are void of a principle of Grace, and yet Folk are very often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in this, and make themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding guilty before God, becauſe they come not this length. 5. Take heed and beware of entertaining any thing that holds and bars out Grace, or of doing any thing that may mar or quench the working or moving of Grace; If ye cannot get Chriſt entertained in your Heart as ye ſhould, be ſure to give it to no other; if ye cannot get Corruption thruſt out, nor mortified, watch againſt the riſing or harbouring of that which ye know to be Corruption; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the incoming or riſing of ſuch evils, as ye know will keep or put away the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; guard alſo againſt the neglecting of ſuch Means, as by the neglect whereof ye may grieve His Spirit. 6. Study and ſeek after a compoſed frame of Spirit in your ordinary walk, and eſpecially in Duties of Worſhip: Carnal Mirth and Jollity, looſe Company, and ſuffering the Heart to go a whoring after the things of the World, do not only provoke Chriſt as they are ſins, but indiſpoſe us for Duty, and mar the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Grace where it is, and keep it back where it is not, therefore the wiſe man ſaith <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.3. that <hi>ſorrow is better then laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for by the ſadneſs of the countenance the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:152256:78"/> heart is made better;</hi> carnal Sorrow is not to be commended, but ſober ſadneſs, or a grave and compoſed frame of Spirit, is better then a light and unſettled frame, it being very hard, if not impoſſible to keep the Heart right even where there is Grace, but where there is ſome counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe or wither-weight; and it muſt be far more impoſſible to keep it right where the work of Grace is not, or but in the very firſt beginnings of it; and though I do not call this compoſedneſs of frame, <hi>Grace,</hi> yet it keeps Folk in ſome capacity, as it were, to receive Grace: It's ſaid <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.27, 28. <hi>That it's good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth, he ſitteth alone and keepeth ſilence, becauſe he hath born it upon him, he puts his mouth in the duſt, if ſo be there may be hope;</hi> for though Croſſes are not always bleſſed to Converſion, yet we may ſee now and then that ſad times are the beginnings of better times, and even in Hypocrites their ſad times ordin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>xiety; and to love as well to ſpeak and hear ſuch things ſpoken of, as may provoke to ſighing and ſadneſs, as theſe that may provoke to laughter; <hi>I ſaid of laughter</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon. Eccleſ.</hi> 2.2.) <hi>it is mad, and of mirth what doth it?</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Even in laughter the heart is ſorrowful, and the end of that mirth is heavineſs:</hi> though oft times our Laughter may not be ſo ſinful, yet it readily more indiſpoſeth us for any ſpiritual Duty, then Sorrow doth; the Heart is like a Clock, whereof, when the inner wheels are ſet a reeling, it is not ſoon righted and ſetled. 7. I would propoſe <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s example to you, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19. and deſire that ye would in the fight and ſenſe ye have of your ſinfulneſs, weakneſs, &amp; feckleſneſs, be bemoaning your ſelves and your ſad condition to God, putting up that Prayer to Him, <hi>Turn thou me and I ſhall be turned;</hi> Theſe words flowing from ſuitable ſenſe are good; and then follows, <hi>after that I was turned, I repented;</hi> It's obſervable, that in the very entry he is graciouſly taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by the Lord, <hi>Surely I have beard</hi> Ephraim <hi>bemoaning himſelf thus;</hi> ſo it is with God's People when they conſider how great Strangers they have been to God, how ſinful and ſtubborn, and how impoſſible it is for them to mend themſelves of themſelves, they retire themſelves into ſome corner, and there bemoane their caſe, and cry out, O! what a ſinful nature is this, and when will it be got amended? <hi>I am as a bullock un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed to the yoke,</hi> ſays <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and the Lord tells, He heard and obſerved it; when poſſibly he thought he was ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if at all Praying, but rather ſighing out as it were a ſhort ej<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>culation to God, O! that I were amended; the laſt word of his Prayer is, <hi>Turn thou me and I ſhall be turned,</hi> or convert me, and I ſhall be converted; he ſees that when all is done, he muſt cleanſe his hands and leave the matter to God, I cannot, but thou canſt work the work, and it ends ſweetly in words of Faith, <hi>for thou art the Lord my God,</hi> and where words of Faith are after ſerious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, that exerciſe hath oft times Faith going alongs with it, hence are theſe words <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.20. <hi>If ſo be there may be hope:</hi> Pſal. 119 <hi>Incline mine heart, open mine eyes,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.13. <hi>How much more will your heavenly Father give his Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> it's good to pray for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of Grace, and to offer our ſelves Subjects to be wrought upon, and Objects to receive what Grace offers to us.</p>
            <p>As we began theſe Directions with a word of Caution, ſo we would cloſe them; Do not think that theſe things in a Natural Man, following this ſinful courſe, will bring forth Grace; neither conclude, that where theſe things only are diſcerned and no more in ſome Perſons, that there Grace is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it being to help ſuch forward that we mainly ſpeak to them: Only in ſum, 1. Keep clean and clear the Light ye have. 2. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ſtrength beſtowed. And 3. What ye have not, put it over on God, and ſeek from Him, who hath Grace to give for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:152256:79"/> working that in you; and it would ſeem that in reaſon ye ſhould refuſe none of theſe three. 1. We ſay, Keep clean and clear your Light, for if ye detain the Truth of God in unrighteouſneſs, and make as it were a Priſoner of it, by ſetting a guard of corrupt Affections about it, ye may bring on blindeſs. 2. Improve what ſtrength ye have, for if ye improve not your ſtrength, were it but in Natural parts and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that makes you inexcuſable when Spiritual and gracious qualifications are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to you, for ye have procured this to your ſelves; are there not many things that ye thought your ſelves able for, that ye never ſeriouſly once eſſayed, much more might have been done as to Repentance, Love to God, Charity to others, and the like; and when ye have not ſtretched your ſelves to the yondmoſt in theſe, there are ſure many things left undone that ye might have done. 3. What ye dow not do, or find your ſelves unable to do, put it on God to do for you, ſeriouſly, humbly, ſingly, and ſelf-deniedly; for if ye come not to God with that which ye are unequal and unable for, ye are ſtill on this ſide your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and without excuſe. Take theſe then together, Improve any ſtrength ye have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any meaſure of Light God hath given you, and coming to God through Jeſus Chriſt, ſeek that ye want from him, and leave the acceptation of your Perſons and of your Performances on Him: This is the reſult of all that we have ſpoken of this Doctrine of Grace, that ye may not take occaſion from the way of Gods diſpencing Grace, to continue graceleſs, which if ye do, it will be ground of a moſt grievous challenge againſt you; but that ye may ſee an excellent conſiſtency betwixt the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of Grace, and your going about the means appointed of God in order to Faith and Converſion, and the ſtudy of Holineſs; and that ye may go on in the uſe of theſe Means, with an Eye to Grace, in the ſenſe of your own inſufficiency to think as of your ſelves, ſo much as a good thought, leaving all your Duties at Chriſt's feet, walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with a ſtopped Mouth; when any thing is wanting, ſtanding at his Door and begging it from him, and when any thing is received, cleanſing, to ſay ſo, your own Hands of it, and giving him all the Thanks, Praiſe, and Glory of it. To him be Praiſe for ever.</p>

            <p>IN the former <hi>Verſe</hi> the Prophet hath aſſerted the rarity and ſcarcity of Believing the Goſpel, and receiving of Jeſus Chriſt offered therein, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> ſaith he, who hath made Chriſt welcome? <hi>And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> to whom hath this Goſpel been made effectual by the Power of God for the engaging of their Hearts to him?</p>
            <p>In theſe two <hi>Verſes</hi> he gives a reaſon as it were of this, which runs upon theſe two. 1. The low appearance of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in reſpect of his outward condition, it hath no outward beauty, ſplendor nor greatneſs to commend it, but is attended with much meanneſs, and with many affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. 2. The itching humour of Men who are taken up with worldly grandour, or greatneſs and glory, and make little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any thing that wants that; as if he ſaid, it is no wonder that Chriſt get few to believe on him, and that few receive this Goſpel, for he will not come with much worldly pomp and grandour, which the Men of the World greatly affect and are much taken up with.</p>
            <p>To open the words a little, we ſhall firſt conſider the matter of this reaſon, and then the conſequence of it; or what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it hath on Mens offending at Chriſt, and continuing in their Unbelief; only we ſhall premit two or three words to both.</p>
            <p>That which we premit <hi>firſt</hi> is this, That the <hi>He</hi> that is here ſpoken of, is our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who in the New Teſtament hath this Text applied to him, for albeit there be no <hi>He</hi> ſo expreſsly mentioned in this Chapter before, yet in the 13. <hi>Verſe</hi> of the former Chapter, to which this relates, the <hi>He</hi> that is ſpoken of here, is called <hi>the Lords Servant;</hi> and it's ſaid of him that <hi>He ſhall be exalted and extolled, and made very high;</hi> and it is not unuſual to ſpeak of Chriſt ſingularly by a relative without an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth;</hi> becauſe Chriſt to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers is ſo ſingular an one, that when ever he is ſpoken of by way of eminency and excellency, as here, they cannot miſtake him, or take an other for him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This want of <hi>form and comelineſs,</hi> is not to be underſtood of any perſonal defect in our Lords Humane Nature, but in reſpect of, and with reference to the tract of his Life, and what accompanied his Humiliation, to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:152256:80"/> wit, That it was low and mean, without that external grandour, pomp and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of outward things, which the world eſteem to be comlineſs and beauty. 3. Where it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall grow up before him,</hi> &amp;c. It relates to the hearers of the report of the Goſpel concerning him, or to the man that believes not the report ſpoken of before; And ſo relates to the words of the firſt <hi>verſ. Who hath believed our report?</hi> Which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly meant of the man that hears of him, and to whom he ſeems nothing worth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his mean and low outward conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for if we ſhould apply it to God, we cannot ſee how it will ſo well infer the ſcope, and be the reaſon of the unbelief aſſerted formerly, for which end it is brought in here.</p>
            <p>We come now to open the words a little, and here we would know that Chriſts low condition is two wayes ſet down in theſe two verſes. 1. In the 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> In reſpect of his want of the abundance of the things of this world. 2. In the 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> In reſpect of the acceſſion of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward croſſes and afflictions; for not only doth he want credit, reſpect, and eſteem, but he hath contempt, deſpight, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; Not only wants he great riches, but he hath poverty, and is in a poor and low condition: The firſt <hi>verſ.</hi> expreſſeth him negatively, to be no worldly great man; The ſecond <hi>verſ.</hi> expreſſeth him poſitively, to be a mean and deſpiſed man. 1. Then theſe words, <hi>He ſhall grow up as a plant out of a dry ground,</hi> are expounded by the words following, <hi>He hath no form nor comlineſs;</hi> For as Shrubs or Scrogs growing up out of dry ground cryn and wither, when trees planted in a fat ſoil, are freſh, fair, and beautiful. So ſhall it be with Chriſt when he cometh forth (ſaith the Prophet) to the eyes of the world, he ſhall, as it were, be like a Scrab in a Moor edge: Our Lord had perſonal and much divine comlineſs in him, as we may ſee, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. Where he ſaith that <hi>the Word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of</hi> grace and truth: But the comlineſs here ſpoken of, is that outward ſtate, pomp, and ſplendour which great men in the world uſe to have, which Chriſt wanted: This is confirmed by the following words, <hi>And when we ſhall ſee him there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him;</hi> There is in men naturally a delight and complacency in that which is beautiful to the natural eye; But (ſaith he) there ſhall be no ſuch thing ſeen in Jeſus Chriſt when he cometh, and therefore no great wonder that few believe on him: And that he ſaith <hi>We,</hi> it is either according to the phraſe uſed in Scripture, to make ſome hard thing digeſt and go down the better with the hearers, whereof the ſpeaker is not guilty; or it is his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what is the humour generally in all men naturally; as if he had ſaid, had even we who are elect and godly no more but carnal eyes, we would think no more of Chriſt then other folk do, for we ſhould get no ſatisfaction to carnal reaſon.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing whereby his low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is ſet out, is in theſe words, <hi>He is deſpiſed and rejected of men,</hi> &amp;c. Not only ſhall he want that which carnal hearts and eyes ſeek and look after, but he ſhall be ſo very low, that men ſhall ſet him at nought, mock, and reject him: And what wonder then that he be not believed on? <hi>A man of ſorrows;</hi> As for the tract of his life, it ſhall be ſpent in ſorrows; <hi>And acquainted with grief;</hi> He ſhall not be a man that ſhall be a ſtranger to croſſes, griefs, and heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but he ſhall be familiarly acquainted with them, and they with him; <hi>And we hid as it were our faces from him;</hi> A conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of the former; As men will not give their countenance to them whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe; So, ſaith he, we ſhall think ſhame to ſee or look at him; He ſhall be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of mens contempt and ſcorn, and we ſhall not ſo much as countenance him; He ſhall be deſpiſed and ſet at nought by <hi>Herod</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers; <hi>And we eſteemed him not;</hi> That is, we the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who owe him more reſpect, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not; And hence he concludes, that it is no wonder that but few believe on him: And ſo in the words following he goes on to deſcribe his Humiliation, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the offence that might be taken at it,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:152256:80"/> 
               <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, there is no ſuch cauſe to skar and ſtumble at Chriſt for his lowneſs and baſe outward condition; for it was not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but for us that he became ſo low, and therefore it did not become us to think ſo little of him; His griefs and ſorrows are humane infirmities that he ſubjected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to for our ſake; For the wrath of God which he ſuffered for us is ſpoken of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And becauſe there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt Chriſts bearing of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and our bearing of infirmities, He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like to us in all things, except ſin: I ſhall for clearing of this, name three diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions given by <hi>Divines</hi> when they diſcourſe of this purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They diſtinguiſh and put difference betwixt the <hi>taking on</hi> of infirmities, and the <hi>contracting</hi> of infirmities; The taking on of infirmities, is the aſſuming of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect without the cauſe; of the infirmity without the ſinful defect: Contracting of infirmity is the drawing on of the defect, with, and by the cauſe; Now, we draw on the cauſe with the effect, Chriſt took on the effect, but he had no ſinful defect in him to draw on ſuch infirmities: He might have taken on the nature of man without the infirmities, if he had ſo pleaſed, but he took on the nature and infirmities without the cauſe. 2. They diſtinguiſh betwixt theſe infirmities which are ſimply natural, ſuch as man might have had though he had never ſinned, and theſe infirmities which flow from mans nature, as fallen and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; The firſt ſort may be called <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,</hi> and look to ſuffering, as to be hungry, thirſty, weary, ſenſible of that which hurts the body; The ſecond ſort may be called <hi>Active,</hi> and are ſinful, as flowing from ſin, and tending to ſin, as inclination to ill, and indiſpoſition to good, dulneſs as to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of Gods mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our Lord took on the firſt ſort of infirmities that are ſimply natural, and may be without ſin; But he was free of the other that implyes corruption in the nature; <hi>He was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. 3. They diſtinguiſh infirmities, in theſe that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>common</hi> to all men, as men, and theſe that are <hi>perſonal</hi> and <hi>acquired,</hi> as flowing from ſome defect in generation, or are drawn on by ſome intemperance, groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the life and converſation; As ſome Families are ſubject to Diſeaſes that come by Generation; Others draw on Diſeaſes by Whoredome, Drunkenneſs, and the like; Now our Lord was free of theſe laſt, becauſe being conceived by the Holy Ghoſt in the womb of the Virgin, there was no defect in His Generation; And being blameleſs in his life and converſation, he could acquire none of theſe infirmities; and therefore the infirmities which he bare are of the firſt ſort; that is, ſuch as are common to all men, and to men as men: And hence we think it probable which ſome ſay, That as our Lord was not ſick, ſo he was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſickneſs, being ſo perfect in his conſtitution or complexion; which makes for the glory of Grace, and ſaith, That our Lord behoved to die a violent death, there being no principle in him tending to a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death, though notwithſtanding he did moſt willingly to ſatisfie Juſtice for ſinners. And this may ſerve to explain theſe words, <hi>That he was a man of ſorrows, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with griefs.</hi>

            <p>We come now to <hi>obſerve</hi> ſome things from the words, And 1. From the condition our Lord is deſcribed to come to the world in; <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> the Lords Servant that was to redeem his people, was to become man, This is here ſuppoſed and Propheſied of, as the firſt ſtep of his Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, He is called <hi>a Man;</hi> And it is an aggravation of it that he was to be <hi>a man of ſorrows;</hi> Or taking our Lord <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to be already come, we may take the <hi>Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> thus; That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the eternal Son of the eternal Father is alſo a true and real Man, A common truth, yet a truth fundamental to the Goſpel, whereof we are not to think the leſs or the worſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a common truth; <hi>When the fulneſs of time came</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 4.) <hi>God ſent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law;</hi> Who, as it is, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. <hi>Thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet took upon him the ſhape of a Servant, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:152256:81"/> was made in likeneſs of men, and being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. It's ſaid of him, That <hi>foraſmuch as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>Both he that ſanctifieth, and they that are ſanctified are all of one, for which cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them brethren;</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>He took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>wherefore in all thinge it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren;</hi> He was made even like unto us in all things except ſin: And if we look to the way of grace, there was good reaſon for this, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of ſinners behoved to be Man. 1. If we conſider the interpoſed or adjoyned threatning to the Covenant of Works, <hi>The day thou eats thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> There muſt be a ſatisfaction to Juſtice, and the curſe threatned muſt be born. 2. The curſe muſt be born by man, the Nature that ſinned muſt die, the Party offending muſt ſatisfie in his own Perſon, or in a Cautioner. And 3. By our Lord's becoming Man, 1. He came to have a right as being near of Kin to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to redeem them. And 2. By this the Law hath right to purſue and exact the Debt of him: And 3. By this, Grace hath acceſs to commend the Redeemer of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to ſinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18. And 4.15, 16. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to he made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High Prieſt,</hi> &amp;c. And that we have ſuch a Redeemer, it makes God, to ſay ſo, tryſtable, and Grace to have acceſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jeſus,</hi> and this gives man acceſs to ſtep in to God. 4. This makes the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Godlineſs to ſhine the more radiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the wiſdome and love of God to ſhine the more conſpicuouſly thorow it, 1 Tim. 3.16. <hi>Without controverſie great is the myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſted in the fleſh:</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. It ſerves to be a prop and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Faith; We may ſay of this truth, as the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.15. ſayes, <hi>If Chriſt he not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, then our Preaching is vain, and your faith is vain;</hi> If Chriſt were not Man, our Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and your Hearing were in vain: 1. By this we have an evidence that our Lord is the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> who was to become Man. 2. By this we ſee a clear way how he was lyable to our debt, and how his ſatisfaction is communicable to us. And 3. In this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we ſee a main and moſt attractive Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to draw ſinners into Chriſt for the actual application of his purchaſe: Our Lord Jeſus is Man, our Brother, and made of a Woman, made under the Law; O! this puts a ſweetneſs and lovelineſs on the Mediator, to commend him to ſinners, for the ingaging of their hearts to him.</p>
            <p>And therefore as a ſecond <hi>Uſe</hi> of it, ſeing there is a Man-Mediator, 1. We pray you, Men and Women, neglect not ſuch a Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as is to be had by his becoming Man, but let this Argument prevail with you to make uſe of him, that he is a true Man: And we may ſay, when this Son of Man comes in the Clouds to Judge the World, it will be one of the greateſt aggravations of the ſin of unbelievers, that he came thus low as to be a Man for the good of men, and yet was not made uſe of by them. 2. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that would be at him, may on this ground be confident and chearful; The Steward of Grace is a Friend, he is a Man, their Brother, and claims Kindred to them that honeſtly aim to do the will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whoſoever ſhall do the will of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaith he, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. <hi>The ſame is my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſiſter, and mother:</hi> Sinners wrong Chriſt and themſelves oft-times when they ſcar at this Cordial Conſolation that by Chriſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Man is allowed on them; Indeed if we were immediatly to go to God, <hi>who is a conſuming fire,</hi> it were no wonder that we ſtood at a diſtance; but when God is in the Mediator Chriſt, God Man to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the World to himſelf, as the word is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>Let us,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>ult. come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</hi> O! make this uſe of it, becauſe he is a friend that ſits on the Throne. —</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:152256:81"/>2dly. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That our Lord Jeſus did not only become Man, but a Man in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding low and afflicted condition; It had been much to the Son of God to have come in the ſhape of man, though he had been Emperour of the whole World, but he thought not that meet; for ſince it was his errand in his firſt coming, not to judge, but to ſave the World, He came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.12. He waſheth the fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of his Diſciples: We may take both the branches of the Doctrine together, our Lord Jeſus not only became Man, but He was a Man without all worldly grandour and pomp, in a low and mean condition; And not only did he want that grandour, but he had much affliction ſhame and ſorrow in the place of it. Need we to prove this? Any who are acquainted with the Hiſtory of the Goſpel know it; He was for the whole tract of his life, not only in a low condition, but a man of ſorrows, griefs, and afflictions; under much perſecution, contempt and reproach; We might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance this, 1. In His Birth. 2. In His Life. And 3. In His Death, The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and lowneſs of his condition, and the afflictions he met with appear clearly in all theſe, wherein ye may behold the glory of grace and of truth; For the more low he became, the more doth the glory of grace ſhine, and the more alſo doth the glory of truth, in that he fulfilled all righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then for his low condition, And that 1. In his birth, he was not born of any of the greateſt Queens; However the birth of <hi>Mary</hi> was Noble, yet ſhe was in a mean condition, for the time eſpouſed to a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter; He was not born in a great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, but in a common Innes, which too being taken up with Gueſts, His Mother was thruſt out, or conſtrained to betake her ſelf to a Stable, where our bleſſed Lord is brought forth, and laid in a Manger, Crib, or Stall, out of which the Beaſts eat their meat for his Cradle; There the Lord and Heir of all things is laid, and hath no other Cradle, neither was the Room hung with rich Hangings and Tapeſtry, as the Rooms of great ones uſe to be. 2. In his life he was low, for no ſooner is he born but his Mother is forced to flee away with him to <hi>Egypt;</hi> He dare not be ſeen; And when he returns, he co-habits with, and ſerves his ſuppoſed Father and his Mother, was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to them, ran their errands, and wrought their work; Therefore he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. the <hi>Carpenter:</hi> There is no outward nor worldly pomp and grandour here; And thus he was for the ſpace of 30. years; And then when he came to his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Miniſtry, he hath no great folks for his followers and Diſciples, but a few poor Fiſher-men; over and above whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts not himſelf loftily, but humbles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to waſh their feet, and to ſerve them: And to hold forth this a little further, ye may take notice of ſome Scripture-expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to that purpoſe, as namely that of <hi>Luk. Chap.</hi> 9.58 <hi>Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head;</hi> That of <hi>John Chap.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not; He came unto his own, and his own received him not;</hi> Though he could have made a thouſand Worlds at a word, yet ſo low was he, that he had not a foot of ground to lay claim to, or to lean his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed head on; And if we look to <hi>Luke</hi> 8. we will find that he was provided for in his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity by ſome few Women, ſuch as <hi>Mary Magdalen; Joanna, Suſanna</hi> and others, <hi>who miniſtred to him of their ſubſtance;</hi> He lived upon the charity of others; And yet 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>By his poverty he made many rich:</hi> And when he went from place to place, his diet was often a-ſeeking, neither do we read of any great cheer he had, but of ſome Barley Cakes and Fiſhes; And often the Diſciples were ſent to ſeek for meat to him. And 3. when it comes to his death, O! How very low is he brought there? When he is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, they hang him up betwixt two thieves, as the moſt notorious Malefactor of the three; And he could hardly come under greater reproach then was caſt upon him at his death; And as a dead man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing really dead, he is laid in the grave and buried, as if death had gotten the victory over him; And ſo he dies a moſt ſhameful
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:152256:82"/> death, after he had lived a moſt mean and abject life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For his afflicted condition, it is clear if we conſider, what troubles did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him in his life, and at his death; No ſooner was he born, but (as I ſaid) he is perſecuted by <hi>Herod,</hi> ſo that himſelf and his parents muſt needs flee down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and they being but poor folks, behoved in ſo long a journey to meet with many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; That they were but poor, may be ſeen by <hi>Maries</hi> offering after her Purification: And when he came forth in his Publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, at his very entry to it he was moſt terribly tempted of the Devil, taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his hunger after long faſting; And all along the exerciſe of it, what contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction did he meet with from the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees?</hi> How did he travel on his feet from place to place? Often ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ject to wearineſs and fainting; ſometimes men will not ſo much as give him lodging, which he ſuffers patiently, and rebukes his Diſciples for their impatience and prepoſterous zeal, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. Many calumnies and reproaches were caſt upon him, He was called <hi>Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub, a Deceiver, a friend of Publicans and Sinners;</hi> How did ſome of his fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ends accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh ſnarl at him, and offer to bind him as a mad man? What plots and conſpiracies were laid and made to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life? And when it came to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of all, <hi>Peter</hi> ſhamefully denied him, and all the other Diſciples forſook him, and fled; Many other things befell him, as may be ſeen in the Hiſtory of his Sufferings, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Evangeliſts: We read that he wept thrice, to let us know that it was his frequent and familiar exerciſe, And a little before his death, we read that he was in a great agony, and did therein ſweat blood, and offered prayers with ſtrong cryes and tears; but we read not that he did laugh, or that ever any worldly mirth was found in him, which clearly makes out this truth, <hi>That he was a man of ſorrows, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Uſe,</hi> It would take the tongues of Men and Angels to ſpeak of it, it being the moſt remarkable and ſoul-refreſhing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that ever the world heard of, even that of which the Angels ſing, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>Good tidings of great joy which ſhall be to all people, that unto you is born in the City of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord: And this ſhall be a ſign to you, ye ſhall find the babe wraped in ſwadling-cloaths, lying in a manger;</hi> Sure we ſhould not ſing leſs, but more then Angels, Men being more concerned then Angels in theſe things; And therefore, 1. Behold, believe and wonder, that he <hi>that was rich became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich;</hi> that he <hi>that was Lord of all, became ſervant to all;</hi> that he <hi>that was the infinite God, the expreſs image of his Fathers perſon, and thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and became of no reputation, and took on him the form of a ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. Behold (we ſay) believe, and wonder at this, 1. In reſpect of the cauſe it came from, to wit, everlaſting love, He did and ſuffered all this moſt willingly, there was no conſtraint on him; But as it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>He delighted to do his Fathers will; He had power to lay down his life, and to take it up again.</hi> 2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the end, it was not to add to his own glory; for as God, his Glory being infinit, it was not, neither was capable of diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or addition, but he became poor that we might be made rich, He was a man of ſorrows, that we might be made to rejoice, he wept that we might laugh, he wanted that we might have: Is not this love ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to be wondered at? Was there ever the like heard of? That God the great Party offended ſhould come ſo low to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the deſpicable Parties offending; and that even while they were rank enemies to him? <hi>God commendeth his love to us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us;</hi> And ſaith him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>John</hi> 15. <hi>Greater love hath no man then this, that a man lay down his life for his friends;</hi> But <hi>when we were enemies Christ died for us;</hi> Were it then an unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able uſe of this Doctrine, to be beholding, believing, and wondering at his love, and to be often thinking and ſaying, <hi>What is man that God ſhould be ſo mindful of him,</hi> as to ſend the Heir of all things his own Son into the world, as his great Ambaſſadour and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:152256:82"/> to negotiat a peace betwixt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and rebel-ſinners, which he was to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe by becoming ſo very low, and by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſo very much?</p>
            <p n="2">2. See in this the great evil and hurt of ſin, and the difficulty of making peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and a ſinner who hath provoked God; Is it a little matter that made our Lord condeſcend and ſtoop ſo low? O! if folk knew the evil of ſin; And that ere Juſtice could be ſatisfied, the Son of God behoved to become Man, and a deeply humbled Man; The Sword of his avenging Juſtice behoved to awake againſt him, and ſmite the man that was his fellow, rather then that ſin ſhould go unpuniſhed, and Juſtice ſhould want ſatisfaction: Beware lightly to boaſt and brag of mercy, or to think it eaſie to make your peace with God; And remember that <hi>it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. See in this, much condeſcending in our bleſſed Lord Jeſus, and a motive as well as a copy of patience in him, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be made of a woman, made under the Law, who ſubmits himſelf unto the Law, and takes on a mean and afflicted ſtate of life in the world; It's a wonder that Chriſts members ſhould take ſo ill with a mean, ſuffering, and hard lot, ſeing their lot is far, very far from the contempt, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ſorrows, weights and griefs that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied their Head and Lord; And it's a ſhame that believers minds and hearts ſhould be ſet ſo much on theſe things, that he who was and is their Lord and Maſter, and the Heir of all things, poſſeſſed ſo little of; or that they ſhould place their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in whole or in part in the injoyment of theſe things, or their miſery in the want of them; More patience under the Croſs, under watchings, wearineſs, reproaches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would become us much better, our bleſſed Lord Jeſus had a great many moe.</p>

            <p n="5">5. See here a moſt real Saviour, ſince he is a ſuffering Saviour; Why did our Lord become thus low?

            <p>IF our hearts were ſuitably tender, the reading of theſe words, knowing of whom they are ſpoken, would ſome way prick and wound them; It's hard to determine, (though it may be we ſhould not make the compariſon) whether there is more grace in our Lords condeſcendence, or more wickedneſs and perverſneſs in the unkind and evil meeting that he gets from ſinners; But ſurely there is much grace on the one ſide in his coming ſo low, and much wickedneſs and perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the other ſide; For what meets he with, even bleſſed Jeſus, <hi>who is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and praiſe of all his Saints,</hi> yea, <hi>the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Fathers glory?

His condeſcending to be a man, and a mean man, and which is yet more, <hi>a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief;</hi> Which if we believed, and knew really what he were, that it was even he <hi>by whom all things were created, who is the beginning of the Creation of God, the firſt-born of every creature,</hi> yea, he <hi>for whom all things were created,</hi> for whoſe glory the world and all things in it were made and continue, He for whom all things are as their laſt end, and through whom they are preſerved in their beeing, and governed in their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſhall be ſeen to tend to his glory in the cloſe; we wold certainly wonder more at this his condeſcendence: And yet alace, it is he that is <hi>deſpiſed and rejected,</hi> and that <hi>we hid as it were our faces from,</hi> and would not give him our countenance; It is he by whom the world was made that is deſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not: And this is the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing in the words which we are now to ſpeak to, even the abominably unſuitable meeting that men give to our Lord Jeſus, who hath ſo far condeſcended, as to leave ſome way his Fathers Glory, not to receive a Kingdom of this World, but to be trode upon in it as a Worm: He is deſpiſed and rejected, and we will not intertain him, nor make him welcome when he cometh; <hi>We eſteem him not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only take this advertiſement for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words, and for grounding of the Doctrine, that this that is ſpoken of Chriſts
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:152256:83"/> Humiliation, and mans ſtumbling at it, is not preciſely to be reſtricted to his Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in his own perſon only, and mens ſtumbling at that, for it is given as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of men their ſtumbling and offending at Chriſt in all times; But it is to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt in his Goſpel and Ordinances throughout all ages, &amp; ſo it comes in as the reaſon why ſo few believe on him; If ye ask the reaſon why men do not now believe and receive Chriſt in the offer of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? Here it is, for <hi>we eſteemed him not,</hi> for <hi>he ſhall grow up before him as a tender plant;</hi> He ſhall be mean and contemptible-like to the men of the world, and in an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted condition, therefore he is not eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore he is not believed on.</p>
            <p>Theſe two are the main <hi>Doctrines</hi> to be ſpoken to here, 1. That Jeſus Chriſt who thus condeſcends and humbles himſelf for the ſalvation of loſt ſinners is not eſteemed of, but deſpiſed and undervalued, which is implied in the words, <hi>When we ſhall ſee him there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him,</hi> and is more clearly holden out in the following words, <hi>He was deſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not.</hi> 2. That this undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and little eſteeming of Jeſus Chriſt, is the great ground of folks unbelief, or the reaſon why men do not believe on him, even becauſe they think him not worthy the receiving; two very clear truths in the words and in experience, though as ſad in their conſequents.</p>
            <p>As to the 1. which is this, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is uſually and ordinarly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly undervalued, and little eſteemed of by the men of the world to whom he is offered in the Goſpel; There are two things implied and ſuppoſed here in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Doctrine, that will clear it, and be as two reaſons of it, 1. That he hath no form nor comelineſs, and no beauty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould be deſired; which holdeth out this that men are ordinarily taken up with, and ſeek after worldly grandour or greatneſs, ſplendour and beauty, that's it that filleth mens eyes, and is that which Chriſt wanted, This we ſay is one reaſon why Chriſt is ſo little thought of, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cometh not with external pomp, obſervation and grandour, nor with great temporal gifts to his followers; That which mainly is deſirable to natural men is that which hath earthly beauty in it, a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful conſideration and ground, though ſuch an one as men are often carried away with, and therefore they deſpiſe and reject the Saviour. 2. Which is another reaſon of the Doctrine, and alſo clearly implyed, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſts Humiliation and coming ſo low for mans ſake, his very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending and ſtooping for their good, is the great ground of their ſtumbling at him, and becauſe of that he is the leſs thought of; Even the very hight of his grace, and that great ſtreach thereof, that the Son of God became thus low as to become Man, a mean Man, and a Man of ſorrows, is a greater ground of ſtumbling to men then if he had never become thus low; Now theſe two being ſuppoſed, and thus explained, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> is clear, to wit, that Jeſus Chriſt that became Man, and performed the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction due to the Juſtice of God for our ſins, is uſually and ordinarily diſeſteemed and undervalued by them to whom he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Goſpel; 1. It was ſo under the Old Teſtament, and is ſo likewiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New; What is almoſt all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſpent on? But to hold out Chriſt upon the one ſide to be a man of ſorrows, and upon the other ſide to ſhew that men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed him not: How was he undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his birth when his Mother was thruſt out to a Stable, and he laid in a Manger? And no ſooner doth he appear in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his publick Miniſtry, but his friends offend at him, and look on him as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted man, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. His Countrey-men contemn him, and were offended at him, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. <hi>Is not this</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Son of Mary, the brother of James and Joſes?</hi> And how was he eſteemed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſeſteemed and undervalued at his death; So that it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.14. <hi>They denyed the holy and juſt one, and deſired that a murtherer ſhould be granted unto them;</hi> They rejected the Prince of Life, and chooſed <hi>Barabbas;</hi> And judging him not worthy to live, they cry <hi>away with him;</hi> Hence our Lord ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>Bleſſed is he that is
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:152256:84"/> not offended in me,</hi> which inſinuats that there were but very few to whom his Humiliation proved not a Stumbling-block. 2. If we conſult experience we will find this to be true, how little is he thought of among <hi>Turks?</hi> amongſt whom his precious Name is blaſphemed, though they pretend more reſpect to him then meer Heathens do: How little is he thought of among the <hi>Jews?</hi> who call him a Deceiver: And if we come nearer, even to the Chriſtian Church, and to ſuch as profeſs their Faith of his being the Eternal Son of God, equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he is Judge of quick and dead, and that they look for Salvation through him, yet if it be put to a tryal, how few are they that will be found to eſteem of him aright? ſince there are but few that believe the report that is made of him, but few that receive him as he is offered in the Goſpel, few that have but ſuch reſpect to him as to prefer him to their Idols, and that give him the firſt and chief ſeat in their hearts: And if we conſider how little eager purſuing there is after him that he may be enjoyed, and how indifferent folks are whether they have or want him; How many things men dote upon and prefer to Jeſus Chriſt, as the Lord complains, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13. <hi>My people have committed two evils, they have forſaken me the fountain of living waters, and have digged to themſelves ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns, even broken ciſterns that can hold no water,</hi> the thing will be clear beyond all debate. We may take in another <hi>Branch</hi> of the Doctrine here, when he ſaith, <hi>We e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed him not;</hi> and it is this, that even Believers are in ſo far as unrenewed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined and not without culpable acceſſion to this ſame ſin of undervaluing of Jeſus Chriſt; It's indeed true that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in his 1 <hi>Epiſt. Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>To you that believe he is precious;</hi> Which place, though it confirm the firſt part of the Doctrine, that to them that believe not he is not precious, but a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence; albeit that Believers being compared with Unbelievers, have ſome precious eſteem of Jeſus Chriſt, yet if we conſider the corrupt nature that in part cleaves to them, and the degree of their eſtimation of him, that it's but very little and low in reſpect of what it ſhould be, and the many peeviſh fits, too's and fro's, up's and down's that they are ſubject to, with the many ſuſpicions and jealouſies they have of him; ſo that though they were juſt now freſh and lively in the exerciſe of their Faith, and of their eſtimation of Chriſt, yet within a little, even by and by, they give way again to their jealouſies, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine will alſo hold true of them, <hi>we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed him not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall give the <hi>ſecond Doctrine</hi> (and then ſpeak to the uſe of both jointly) which is this, That there is nothing more culpably acceſſory to the abounding of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, then the poor thoughts and little eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that Men have of Jeſus Chriſt; the undervaluing of him is the great ground and reaſon why they believe not on him; and on the contrary, if the Hearers of the Goſpel had higher thoughts, and a more precious eſteem of Chriſt, and valued him according to his unvaluable worth, there would be more believing in him then there is: When the Goſpel comes to invite Men to the Wedding, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. when Chriſt is rooſed and commended as to what he is, what he hath purchaſed, and what he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offereth to Sinners, it's ſaid, <hi>that thoſe who were bidden made light of it, and went away, one to his farm, another to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandice,</hi> &amp;c. when Chriſt was ſpoken of, and the offer of Life through him, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued and deſpiſed it, and made light of the offer, and therefore turned their backs, for they thought more of the Houſe, of the Oxen, of the Farm, and of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Wife, then they thought of him: And <hi>Acts</hi> 17. when <hi>Paul</hi> is preaching Chriſt at <hi>Athens,</hi> the Philoſophers and Orators, theſe learned Heads, deſpiſe and diſdain him as a ſetter forth of ſome ſtrange and uncouth god: If we compare this with its contrary, it will be further clear, to wit, wherever there is eſtimation of Chriſt, it proves a help to Faith and a ground of it; ſo where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſt is lightlied, diſeſteemed and undervalued, it breeds in Folk, and is a ground to them of theſe three. 1. It cools, or rather keeps cool their love and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:152256:84"/> to him; where he is diſeſteemed and undervalued, he cannot be loved, and People in that caſe become like theſe that are brought in <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17. ſaying, <hi>It was better with as when we did bake cakes to the queen of heaven;</hi> the Lord is counted by them to be as <hi>a wilderneſs and land of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and they ſay, as it is <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.31. <hi>We are lords, and will come no more unto thee;</hi> and when Men eſteem not Chriſt, they ſeek not after him, they care not for an intereſt in him, they truſt not to him; when a Man valueth a Pearl, he will readily ſell all that he hath that he may buy it, but that which is not eſteemed, there will be no care to come by it. 2. It hath influence to obſtruct Folks giving him credit, which is of the very eſſence of Faith; ſo then, where he is not eſteemed of, he is not, he cannot be believed on; the former ſays, that we will not marry him, this ſays, we will not trow him, nor truſt the reality of his offer: Where he is not eſteemed of, he is not taken up to be real, in good earneſt, and faithful in what he ſays; His offers are looked upon as having neither ſolidity nor reality in them, therefore <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. theſe two are put together, firſt its ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are they that are called to the marriage ſupper of the Lamb;</hi> and then it is ſubjoined, <hi>theſe are the true and faithful ſayings of God;</hi> ſo that when Chriſt is not eſteemed of, he is not thought worthy the crediting and lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to; And it's on this ground that the Lord founds his contraverſie with his profeſſing People, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5. <hi>What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they have gone far from me, and have walked after va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and are become vain?</hi> they undervalued his word, they thought him not worthy credit, and therefore they turned the back on him; the ſame is inſinuated by the Lord, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.3. <hi>O my people, what have I done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and wherein have I wearied thee? teſtifie againſt me.</hi> 3. This little eſteem of Chriſt weakens hope or expectation of any good that Men may have from him; when we eſteem him not, there is no expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of getting our need ſupplied, and our wants made up by him, nor of attaining in him the Happineſs that we would be at, and therefore there are no ſerious addreſſes made to him for the ſame: Theſe three, Love to him, Truſt in him, hope from and through him, being the prime Graces in a Chriſtian, when they are weakened, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief moſt certainly in ſo far prevaileth; and it being Chriſt's worthineſs, and the eſtimation thereof that gives ground to all theſe; then ſure, when he is not eſteemed but undervalued, theſe muſt alſo fall in their exerciſe, and be in utter non-entry where he is altogether undervalued: Now, laying all theſe together, there can hardly be any thing more culpably acceſſory to the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Unbelief then the undervaluing of precious Jeſus Chriſt; it's impoſſible that he can be cordially welcomed where he is not at all eſteemed of.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Uſes</hi> of theſe Doctrines, they are of large extent, ſerving to make manifeſt a root of bitterneſs, and a great neck-break of multitudes of Souls, and which Men and Women will not eaſily be perſwaded to believe. Let this therefore be the 1. <hi>Uſe</hi> of it, To diſcover a great Sin that is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Hearers of this Goſpel; among many other things that may be charged on them, this is one and not the leaſt, even little eſtimation of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo little, that when he is ſpeaking, they count him ſcarce worthy the hearing; hence is the ſlumbering and ſleeping of ſo many when he is preached of, which holds out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the nature of all Men and Women; this deſpiſing, undervaluing, and thinking little of Chriſt, is a Sin that may for a long time cleave faſt and cloſe to the Hearers of the Goſpel, and doth ſo to many to their very dying day. It may be ye will think this a ſtrange and uncoath ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rge, and that whoever diſeſteem him, ye do certainly eſteem him much, but it were better ye were ſeriouſly and humbly ſaving with the Prophet here, <hi>He was deſpiſed and we eſteemed him not:</hi> There are many who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once ſuſpect themſelves as guilty of, or chargeable with this evil; for whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, let me ſpeak but a few words, Is there not ſuch a bitter root in you? If it be natural to all Men and Women, how comes it to paſs that ye are free of it? Is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:152256:85"/> of the ſeed of the Serpent in you? and if there be, will there not be hatred at the ſeed of the Woman in you? are ye any other ſort of Hearers then they were to whom this is ſpoken? were they not Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel as well as ye? nay he ſpeaks here of Hearers of the Goſpel in all Ages, and yet ye will diſdain to take with this Sin, and will account it to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, if not an unjuſt charge and imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſay of you that ye are undervaluers and deſpiſers of Chriſt; but the reaſon of it is twofold, the <hi>firſt</hi> whereof is, Becauſe ye know not what Chriſt's worth is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye do neither eſteem him, nor know that ye diſeſteem and undervalue him; whereas they who have win to ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his worth, are always, or very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten complaining that they cannot get him ſuitably thought of and eſteemed. The <hi>ſecond</hi> Reaſon is, Becauſe ye know not your ſelves, and therefore ye take ſelf-love and eſtimation of your ſelves to be love to him and eſtimation of him; ye think your ſelves ſo well, that ye cannot endure to think that ye want any Grace or good thing; and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Chriſt being a good thing, and ye thinking that ye could not hold up your face and own the reproaching and deſpiſing of him, ye will not let it light that ye want this Grace and good thing, a precious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of him: But there is no greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that ye are lying under the power of the deceit and deluſion of your own Hearts, that your natural diſtemper and Feaver is not yet cooled and calmed, but that ye are ſtill roving in Nature; and therefore, though ye be living in enmity at God and Chriſt, yet ye cannot be made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it; we really think it ſomewhat ſtrange, that Men and Women ſhould live twenty, thirty, fourty, or fifty years under the Goſpel, and yet never be brought to groan under this enmity, nor to lay to heart this Sin of undervaluing of Chriſt: But if it be a truth that none naturally do love and eſteem him, then certainly many of you are groſsly miſtaken, that think ye eſteem highly of him; Ah! your fancied eſteem of him will be counted an undervaluing of him.</p>
            <p>And if ye aſk, What is that to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value Chriſt, or when is he undervalued? I anſwer, He is undervalued 1. When he is not matched with or married, when ye match with himſelf, whereof he maketh of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, is not cloſed with upon his own terms; for what I pray can hinder the ending of a Bargain, or finiſhing a Marriage contract, eſpecially when it's ſo full, free, and rich on the Propoſer and Suiters part, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Folk think it is not fit for them, or that they think nothing of it at all? and this is it that hinders cloſing with Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>They made light of it and went away,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. <hi>My people would not hearken to my voice, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me.</hi> 2. When any thing is made equal to Chriſt, much more when any thing is preferred to him, he is undervalued and not eſteemed of; when he gets little or none of Folks care and labour, little of their time, little of their love and delight, few or none of their thoughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they are quite carried away after other things, for <hi>where the treaſure is, there the heart will be alſo;</hi> and were Chriſt our Treaſure, and precious in our eſteem, our Hearts would be more ſet on him; but it's ſtrange, ſad, and even aſtoniſhing to think, how little our Spirits are exerciſed with the thoughts of Chriſt; how little they are taken up with longing for him and delighting in him, and yet we will think that we eſteem him. 3. Our Lord is undervalued when he is not made uſe of, and imployed, and lippened to as an able and ſufficient Saviour; If there be a learned and ſkilful Phyſician in a City in all or moſt Diſeaſes, or an able Lawyer to plead all Cauſes; if Folk have Diſeaſes to be cured, and Cauſes to be pleaded, and yet do not imploy ſuch a Phyſician or ſuch a Lawyer, but go to ſome other, though far leſs ſkilful and able, they undervalue him; It is even ſo here, when Folks have many Sins, and they ſeek not to him for Pardon, many, not only Temporal wants, but alſo and mainly, many Spiritual wants, and do not acknowledge him in them, neither ſeek to him for ſupply of them, many predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Evils, and they ſeek not to him to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them, many Snares and Temptations,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:152256:85"/> and they do not make uſe of him to prevent and lead them by them, and many Spiritual Cauſes to be pleaded before God, or at his Bar, and they do not imploy him as Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to plead for them. 4. He is underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued when Folk think not themſelves happy enough in him, nor ſicker enough in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining with him, and when he doth not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie and fully content them, as if he were <hi>yea and nay,</hi> and as if <hi>all the promiſes were not yea and amen in him;</hi> when he is not credited intirely, and reſted upon, he is not eſteemed of, hence he complains <hi>John</hi> 5. <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have life:</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>How often would I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered you and ye would not?</hi> he would, to ſay ſo with reverence, fain do them a good turn, but they will not lippen to him. O! how much undervaluing of Chriſt is there even among believers, when they hold and draw with him, intertain jealouſies and ſuſpitions of him, ſcarcely credit him, and when they do at any time credit him, are in a manner ready to take back their word again; How often are Creature-comforts overvalued by them? And how often are the conſolations of God ſmall with them? Theſe and many other wayes are they, even they, in ſome conſiderable meaſure and degree guilty of undervaluing of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Take with this ſin, acknowledge and ſeek pardon for it,; It were a good token of ſome tenderneſs, to be mourning for enmity againſt Chriſt, and for underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing of him, as well as for Drunkenneſs, Fornication, Theft, or any other groſs ſin; And where that gracious and right mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is ſpoken of, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. comes, it will be in ſpecial for this undervaluing of Chriſt to the hight of piercing of him: We would ask any of you that think ye repent, if this ſin of ſlighting him hath pierced you as it did theſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2? It may be, ſome think themſelves ſo cleanly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that they have not many ſins to mourn for, O! dreadful miſtake; But though ye had no more, is not this enough that ever there ſhould have been enmity in your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome at Chriſt? And ſhould not this prick you at the very heart that ever ye ſhould have ſo undervalued him? But readily they that ſee feweſt ſins in themſelves, will ſee and take with leaſt of this ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. It ſerves to be a warning to all men in nature, to conſider what their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is; Do ye that have this enmity, and are undervaluers of Chriſt, know what is in your hearts? And do ye conſider what poſture ye will be found in, if Grace make not a change, in the day of Chriſt? ye will be found amongſt theſe deſpiſers and haters that would not have him to reign over them; How will you dar to appear, or in what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture will ye appear before him, when he whom ye deſpiſed, ſhall come in the glory of his Father with all the holy Angels with him, and ſhall ſit upon the Throne of his glory? And yet appear ye muſt; How will the conſcience then gnaw, and the heart be affrighted? How will challenges waken, yea, ſting and prick you on this ground, that the Son of God, the Heir of all things, the Lord of lords, and King of kings, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Marriage to you, was undervalued, and Marriage with him made light of, and that a thing of nought was put in his room and place? Will not this be a horrible chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge in that day? And if ye would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what will be their poſture that mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and buffetted him, and plucked off his hair, that nodded with the head, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Aha, and bade him come down from the Croſs, that did ſcourge him, and hang him up upon the Croſs betwixt two Thieves; Such a poſture will all of you be in who have deſpiſed and diſeſteemed him; ye will meet with that ſame ſad ſentence, <hi>Bring out theſe mine enemies that would not that I ſhould reign ever them, and ſlay them before me;</hi> O! what a ſtrange puniſhment ſuppoſe ye will that be, when the Saviour of ſinners ſhall ſtand by and look on till he ſee ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance execute on ſinners that deſpiſed him? Think on it, for there is ſuch a day coming, when ye will all appear before him, and when your reckonings will be caſt up; ſuffer not your ſelves to be cheated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an opinion that it will be accounted a little ſin to be found under this guilt of deſpiſing Chriſt, and let not one of you put it off himſelf, and over upon another; they will be found deſpiſers of him that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:152256:86"/> would never let it light, nay even many that have Preached him, and that would have been angry at prophanity in others, as may be gathered from <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22.</p>
            <p>The 4. <hi>Uſe</hi> ſerves to commend this to you as a piece of your duty, to ſtudy to know Chriſt, and to have the ſuitable impreſſion of Chriſt and of his worth as the great mean contributive to the bringing you to credit him, and believe on him, and to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving a main obſtruction that hinders your Faith, and that is the undervaluing of him; For if undervaluing of him be the great cauſe of unbelief, and that which mainly obſtructs Faith; then the eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him from a due impreſſion of his worth, muſt be a great mean of, and help to Faith, and the more he be eſteemed of, the more will he be believed on: It hath an attractive vertue to draw ſinners to love him, a ſcrewing vertue to ſcrew up the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections towards him; and withal a fixing and eſtabliſhing vertue to ſettle and ſtay the Soul upon him by believing; the ſoul that from the right impreſſion of his worth eſteems of him, knows that it may lippen to him, for he is holy and true; And hence it is, that the great thing that believers take to ground their prayers upon, is ſome excellency in God, ſome one or other of his Titles and Attributes upon which they fix, to bear them up under and againſt any difficulty that preſſeth hard upon them; This fixes alſo their hope and expectation of attaining of any good thing that they want through him: And therefore upon the one ſide we would commend to you the ſtudy of Chriſt's worth, and upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an high eſtimation of him, as that which will fix your Faith, and Love, and Hope on him; This we ſee to be in a high degree in <hi>Paul, Philip.</hi> 3. <hi>I account all things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to be but loſs and dung for the excellency of the knowledge of him,</hi> and his tranſcendent worth, ye would not think it loſt labour, to read and ſtudy theſe places of Scripture, that ſhew what our Lord Jeſus is in his Perſon, Nature, and Offices, that ye may have the Faith of his God-head fixed, and may be clear as to the excelling fulneſs that is in him; as namely that of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.6. <hi>To us a Child is born, to us a Son is given, the government ſhall be upon his ſhoulders, and his Name ſhall be called Wonderful, Counſellour, the Mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace, of whoſe Kingdom and Government there ſhall be no end;</hi> And to ſtudy his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Properties, his Eternity, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, Faithfulneſs, Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> common to him with the Father and Holy Ghoſt; and the excellent qualifications that as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator he is repleniſhed with; being full of grace and truth, and in all things having the preheminency; See <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>John</hi> 1.14. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reaſon why we preſs you to this, is not only that ye may have more clear Theory and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation; But alſo and mainly that your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections may be delighted in him, and that your Faith may without hink or heſitation come to give him credit; Ignorance of Chriſt breeds diſeſtimation, and diſeſtimation makes you not to give him credit, and thus ye are kept at a diſtance from him; There is no ſtudy more pleaſant, more precious, and more profitable. There is here then a task for you that ask what ye ſhall do; even to read and ſtudy the excellency of Jeſus Chriſt, and to labour to have it well fixed in the imagination of the thoughts of your hearts; It will give you notable direction what to do, even that which is well-pleaſing to God, and may be very profitable to you through his bleſſing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 5. See here the great neceſſity and conveniency of ſtudying the diſeſtimation of Chriſt that is in us, as well as of ſtudying the worth that is in him, and what he hath out of love ſuffered for us; Theſe two are put together in the Text; it being need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us to be as well acquainted with the one as with the other: We ſhall give you this uſe in two ſhort <hi>Doctrines,</hi> The 1. whereof is, That it is a neceſſary duty for the hearers of the Goſpel to ſtudy through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to be convinced of, and clear in their diſeſtimation of Chriſt, as well as of his worth and excellency, becauſe it maketh up repentance, and maketh it flow, and thorowly humbleth the ſinner when he findeth this deſperat wickedneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:152256:86"/> to be in himſelf, and maketh him kindly to loath and abhor himſelf; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this deſperat wickedneſs be ſeen and felt, that great and bitter mourning ſpoken of, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. will never flow forth.</p>
            <p>The 2. is, That where folk have any juſt eſtimation of Chriſt and of his worth, and are ſenſible of the evil of unbelief, there will alſo be ſome ſenſe of the ſin of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of him, and the more ſenſe they have of the evil of unbelief, they will be the more ſenſible of their undervaluing of him; And will with the Prophet here cry out, <hi>He was deſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not:</hi> And from both theſe ye may ſee the neceſſity of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying to find out this corruption; the ſearch and diſcovery whereof, will in-ſight you in the evil and perverſneſs of your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo deeply humble you; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſerve highly to commend Chriſt and his Grace to you; and without the diſcovery of this corruption, it's impoſſible ever to be humble thorowly, or to have right thoughts of Chriſt and of his Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 6. It ſerves to let us ſee the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of believing in Chriſt, and of the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him; becauſe there is no other way to be free of the challenges of miſpriſing and not eſteeming of him, but by receiving of him, and believing on him.</p>
            <p>A 7th <hi>Uſe</hi> may be added, and it's this, That the moe there be that deſpiſe Chriſt, and the greater difficulty there be in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him, the more reaſon have they to be thankful that he graciouſly works any ſuitable eſtimation of himſelf in, and brings them to believe on him; Theſe who have gotten any glimpſe of his Glory which hath lifted him high in their eſtimation to the drawing forth of their faith and love after him, would praiſe him for it; It's he, and only he that opened your eyes to ſee him, and gave you that eſtimation of him, and circumciſed your hearts to love him; let him therefore have all the praiſe and glory of it; This is the Word of God, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bleſs it to you through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p>THis is a moſt wonderful Subject that the Prophet is here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of, even that which concerneth the ſufferings of our bleſſed Lord Jeſus, by way of prediction ſeveral hundreds of years before his Incarnation; It was much that he was to be <hi>a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief;</hi> But this was more, that <hi>he was deſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not;</hi> There is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful grace upon the one ſide, that our Lord became ſo very low, and wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:152256:87"/> and enmity on the other ſide, that we deſpiſed him, and eſteemed him not, even becauſe of his lowneſs.</p>
            <p>In the words now read, and forward, the Prophet ſets himſelf to remove the offence that men took at our Lords Humiliation, by ſhewing them, that although he became ſo low, yet he was not to be the leſs eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of for that; And the ground which he layes down to remove the offence, is in the firſt words of the Text, which in ſum is this, that there was nothing in himſelf wherefore he ſhould have been brought ſo low, there was no ſin in him, neither was there any guile found in his mouth, but he was graciouſly pleaſed to take on him that which we ſhould have born; and therefore men ought not to ſtumble and offend at his ſtooping to bear that which would with its weight have cruſhed them eternally, and thereby to make their peace with God: in the 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> he ſhews how it came to paſs that he ſtooped ſo low, <hi>All we</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>like ſheep have gone aſtray, and turned every one of us to our own way, and the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all;</hi> We had loſt our ſelves, and God in the depth of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wiſdom, love, and good-will, found out the way to ſave us; wherein (to ſpeak ſo) a Covenant was tranſacted betwixt God and the Mediator, who becomes Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner for our ſins, which are transferred on him: From the 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> to the 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> he goes on in ſhewing the execution of this tranſaction, and how the Cautioner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all according to his engagement; And from the 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> to the cloſe, we have the promiſes made to him for his ſatisfaction: The ſcope is, as to remove the ſcandal of the Croſs, ſo to hold out our Lords purſuing the work of ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God for elect ſinners, and the good ſucceſs he had in it.</p>
            <p>In the 4, and 5. <hi>verſes</hi> we have three things, 1. This ground aſſerted, <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows.</hi> 2. Mens enmity aggreged from this, <hi>yet we did eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God, and afflicted;</hi> In the very mean time that he condeſcended to ſtoop ſo low for us, and to bear that which we ſhould have born, we eſteemed but little of him, we looked on him as a plagued man. 3. This is more fully explained, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>But he was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities,</hi> He was ſo handled for our ſins, and <hi>the chaſtiſement of our peace was on him,</hi> that which made our peace with God was on him, <hi>By his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> the ſtripes that wounded and killed him cured us.</p>
            <p>We have here then, rather as it were a ſad narration, then a Propheſie of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel holding out a part of our Lords ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, yet a clear foundation of the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people of God; it being the ground of all our Faith of the pardon of ſin, of our peace with God, and of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident appearing before him, that our Lord was content to be thus dealt with, and to <hi>give his back to the ſmiters, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall clear the words in the aſſertion, which will ſerve to clear the words of the whole Chapter, and alſo of the Doctrines to be drawn from it. 1. The thing that Chriſt bare is called <hi>griefs</hi> and <hi>ſorrows,</hi> by which we underſtand the effects that ſin brings on men in the world, for its the ſame that in the 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> is called his being <hi>wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our tranſgreſſion, and bruiſed for our iniquity;</hi> It's a wounding that iniquity cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and meritoriouſly procureth; It's not ſin it ſelf, but the effect of ſin, to wit, the puniſhment the ſorrow and grief that ſin brings with it, called <hi>griefs</hi> and <hi>ſorrows;</hi> Partly becauſe grief and ſorrow is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyned with ſin, partly to ſhew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity and exceeding greatneſs of this grief and ſorrow, and the bitter fruits that ſin hath with it. 2. How is it ſaid that Chriſt hath <hi>born</hi> and <hi>carried</hi> their griefs and ſorrows? By this we underſtand, not only Chriſts removing of them, as he removed ſickneſs and diſeaſes, as it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.16, 17. But alſo and mainly his actual and real enduring of them, as the phraſe is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed in Scripture; <hi>That man ſhall bear his iniquity,</hi> or he ſhall bear his ſin, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. and many other places; It ſees out a real inflicting of the puniſhment that ſin deſerves, on him. 3. That it is ſaid
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152256:87"/> 
               <hi>our</hi> griefs, and <hi>our</hi> ſorrows, it is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly or ſuperfluouſly ſet down, but to meet with the offence that men take at Chriſts humbling himſelf ſo low; As if he had ſaid, What aileth you to ſtumble at Chriſts coming ſo low, and being ſo afflicted? It was not for his own ſins, but for ours, that he was ſo handled; And they are called <hi>our</hi> griefs and ſorrows, 1. Becauſe we by our ſins procured them, they were our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, and due to us, the debt was ours, though he as our Cautioner took it on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. 2. Becauſe though the Elect have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct reckonings, and peculiar ſins, ſome moe, ſome fewer, ſome greater, ſome leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, yet they are all put on Chriſts account; there is a combination of them, a gathering of them all on him, as the word is, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>He hath laid on him,</hi> or made to meet on him <hi>the iniquities of us all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning then of the aſſertion is this; Surely this is the cauſe of Chriſts Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this makes him not only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Man, but to be a mean poor Man, and to have a comfortleſs and afflicted life in the World, that he hath taken on him that Puniſhment, Curſe and Wrath that was due to us for our Sins; and therefore he ought not to be offended and ſtumbled at.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe <hi>Socinians,</hi> the great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſts ſatisfaction, and of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his People, labour to elude this place, and to make Chriſt only an exemplary Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and deny that he really and actually did undergo theſe Griefs and Sorrows for the Sins of his Elect; We ſhall a little clear and confirm the expoſition we have given; the queſtion is not about the taking away of Sin, but about the manner of removing it; They ſay that it is by Gods pardoning of it without a Satisfaction; We ſay it is by Chriſts Satisfaction; So the difficulty in expounding the words, is whether to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them of Chriſts removing our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and Griefs from us, or of his bearing of them for our Sin, and ſo really taking it away: And that this Scripture means not of a ſimple removing of them, as he did remove Sickneſs, <hi>Matth</hi> 8.17. but by a real taking them on himſelf, and bearing of of them in order to the ſatisfaction of the Juſtice of God for our Sins: We ſhall give theſe Reaſons to confirm it. 1. Becauſe theſe words are to be underſtood of ſuch a bearing of Sorrows and Griefs as made Chriſt to be contemptible and deſpiſed before others, This is clear from the ſcope, for they are given as a reaſon why Chriſt was reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſpiſed as a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief, and why Men ſhould not ſtumble at him for all that, becauſe it was for them; now, if he had only remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sorrows from them as he did Sickneſſes, it had not been a cauſe of his Sorrow and Grief, nor of any Mans ſtumbling at him, but had been rather a cauſe of his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Mens eſteem; But its given here as a cauſe of that which went before in the firſt part of the 3. <hi>Verſe,</hi> and alſo as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Men ſhould not ſtumble at him, and withall as an aggravation of their guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> who did ſtumble at him: Now it's clear that the ground of the <hi>Jews</hi> deſpiſing and mocking of him, was nor his removing of Sickneſſes and Diſeaſes, but his ſeeming to be given over unto Deaths power. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which is called here, <hi>bearing of ſorrows and griefs,</hi> is in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, called, a <hi>being wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,</hi> which imports not only that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was wounded, but that our Iniquities were the cauſe of his being wounded, and that the deſert of them was laid on him. 3. This wounding is holden forth, to be the <hi>ſtripes</hi> whereby <hi>we are healed;</hi> and <hi>all we like ſheep have gone aſtray, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all;</hi> we did the wrong but he made the amends; and it was ſuch a wounding as proves a cure to us, and makes way for our peace and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God; and ſuch, as without it, there is no healing for us, for <hi>by his ſtripes we are healed;</hi> it's by his ſwallowing up of the river and torrent of Wrath that was in our way and would have drowned us eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, had not he interpoſed for us, that we eſcape. 4. Conſider the parallel places to this in the New Teſtament, and we will find that this place holds our Chriſts re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l and actual bearing of our Sorrows and and Griefs; I ſhall only name three, The
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152256:88" rendition="simple:additions"/> 1. Is that of the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He hath made him to be ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> which can be no other way exponed but of Chriſts being made an Offering and Sacrifice for our Sins; he not being a Sinner himſelf, but becoming our Cautioner and engaging to pay our Debt, and to tell down the price for the ſatisfaction of Divine Juſtice; he is reckoned to be the Sinner, and our Sins are imputed to him, and he is dealt with as a Sinner. A 2d place is that of <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, by being made a curſe for us, as it is written, curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree;</hi> The Sorrows and Griefs that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſays here he ſhould bear, are there exponed by the Apoſtle, to be, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a Curſe, or his bearing of the Curſe that we ſhould have born; it's not meant ſimply of his removing the Curſe from us, but it alſo ſets out the manner how he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, to wit, by his own bearing of it himſelf, being nailed to the Croſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the threatning given out before. The 3d. place is that of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the tree;</hi> where there is a direct reference to this place of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which is cited for confirmation of what the Apoſtle ſaith, and every word is full and hath a ſpecial ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and emphaſis in it, <hi>He his own ſelf bare,</hi> the ſame word that is here, and <hi>our ſins,</hi> and <hi>in his own body,</hi> and <hi>on the tree;</hi> intimating the loweſt ſtep of his Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>by whoſe ſtripes ye were healed,</hi> for <hi>ye were as ſheep going aſtray,</hi> &amp;c. by his bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Sins the burden of Sin was taken off us, and we are ſet free.</p>
            <p>I know that place of <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.17. hath its own difficulty, and therefore I ſhall ſpeak a word for clearing of it; he hath ſpoken <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. of Chriſt's <hi>healing all that were ſick,</hi> and then ſubjoyns in the 17. <hi>verſ. That it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by</hi> Iſaias <hi>the prophet, ſaying, himſelf took our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and bare our ſickneſſes;</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe enemies of Chriſt would infer, that this place of Scripture hath no other, nor further meaning, but of Chriſt's curing of ſome ſick Folks, and of the deputed or committed power which he hath to pardon ſins; but we ſuppoſe that the reaſons which we have already given, make it clear, that this cannot be the meaning of the place, to which we ſhall add firſt. A Reaſon or two, and ſecondly, Give you the true meaning of it.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons why one cannot be the meaning of the place, are 1. Becauſe <hi>Acts</hi> 8.32. this Scripture is ſpoken of as being dayly a fulfilling by Chriſt, and therefore it could not be fulfilled in theſe few days wherein he was in the Fleſh upon Earth. 2. Becauſe this bearing of our Griefs and Sorrows is ſuch a piece of Chriſts Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as thereby he took on all the Griefs and Sorrows of all the Elect at once, both of theſe who lived in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> his time, and of theſe who lived before, and ſince his time, and therefore cannot be reſtricted to the curing of Temporal Diſeaſes in the days wherein he was on Earth, nay, not to the pardoning of the Sins of the Elect then living, there being many El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct before and ſince comprehended in this his Satisfaction, which was moſt certainly a Satisfaction for the Sins of the Elect that were dead and to be born, as well as for the Sins of them that were then living.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the meaning of the place, 1. We are not to look on Chriſt's curing of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Diſeaſes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8 16. as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fulfilling of this place, <hi>Iſa</hi> 52.4. but as many Scriptures are ſpoken by way of allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to other Scriprures, ſo is this; there is indeed ſome fulfilling of the one in the other, and ſome reſemblance betwixt the one and the other, and the reſemblance is this, even to ſhew Chriſts tenderneſs to the outward condition of Folks bodies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he evidenced his tenderneſs and reſpect to the inward ſad condition of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls whereinto they were brought through their Sin; the great thing aimed at by the Prophet. 2. If we conſider the Griefs and Sorrows that Chriſt bare and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered complexly in their cauſe and eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cts, he in healing of theſe Diſeaſes and Sickneſſes bare our Griefs and carried our Sorrows, becauſe when he took on our Debt, he took it on with all the conſequences of it; and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:152256:88"/> ſo though Chriſt took on no Diſeaſe in his own Perſon, for we read not that he was ever ſick, yet in taking on the Debt in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of the Elect, he virtually took on all Sickneſſes and Diſeaſes, or what they ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all Diſeaſes or ſhould have ſuffered, he took it on together; and hereby he had a right, to ſpeak ſo, to the carrying of all Diſeaſes, and in carrying of them he had reſpect to the cauſe of them, to wit, Sin; therefore to ſuch as he cured, he ſays very often, <hi>Thy ſins be forgiven thee;</hi> he ſtudied to remove that in moſt of them he did deal with; and ſo looking on our Lord as taking on our Sins complexly with the cauſe, and as having a right to remove all the effects of Sin, evidencing it ſelf in the removing of theſe Diſeaſes whereof Sin was the cauſe, theſe words may be thus fulfilled; and ſo they are clear, and the Doctrine alſo; We have here no meer exemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That Sin, in no Fleſh, no, not in the Elect themſelves, is without Sorrow and Grief; Tribulation and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh are knit to it, or it hath theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it; or take the Doctrine thus, Wherever there is Sin, there is the cauſe of much Sorrow and Grief; no more can the native cauſe be without the effect, then Sin can be without Sorrow and Grief, it's the plain aſſertion of Scripture. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>Indignation and wrath, tribulation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil;</hi> which one place, putting the four words together ſays, 1. That there is Sorrow moſt certainly and inſeparably on every Soul that hath ſinned, And 2. That this Sorrow is exceeding great (which may alſo be the reaſon why this Sorrow is ſet out in two words in the Text) therefore four words are uſed by the Apoſtle to expreſs it: It's not our purpoſe here to diſpute, whether God in his Juſtice doth by neceſſity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puniſh the Sinner: Theſe three things conſidered, will make out the Doctrine, which is, That there is a neceſſary connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If we conſider the exceeding unſuitableneſs of Sin to the holy Law of God, and how it is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrariety to that moſt pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Law. 2.

If we conſider the revealed will of God in the Threatning, who hath ſaid, <hi>the day thou eatest thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> we may ſay there is, as they ſpeak in the Schools, a hypothetick neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of grief and ſorrow to follow on Sin, and that there is a neceſſary connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them; and this may very well ſtand with the Mediator his coming in and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to take that Grief and Sorrow from off us, and to lay it on himſelf; but it was once ours becauſe of our Sin.</p>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:152256:89"/> yet as to the intention of the thing, and even of the Sinner, it wrongs him; Sin in theſe reſpects may be called <hi>infinite,</hi> and the wrong done to the Majeſty of God thereby, may be called infinite; as theſe who built <hi>Babel,</hi> their intention in that work breathed forth infinite wrong to God, as having a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tendency to bring them off from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on him; and ſo every Sin if it had its will and intent, would put God in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to it, and ſet it ſelf in his room, and therefore Sin in ſome reſpect as to the wrong againſt God is infinite.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That the real and very great Sorrow that the Sins of the Elect deſerved, our Lord Jeſus did realty and actually bear and ſuffer; as we have exponed the words and confirmed the expoſition given of them, ye have a clear confirmation of the Doctrine from them; 1. <hi>Griefs</hi> and <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows</hi> in the plural Number, ſhew intenſneſs of Sorrow and Grief. 2. That they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>ours,</hi> it ſhews our propriety in them, And 3. That it's ſaid Chriſt <hi>bare</hi> them; Theſe concur to prove the Doctrine; that the ſame Sorrow which the Sins of the Elect deſerved Chriſt bare; It not only ſays that our Lord bare Sorrows, but the ſame Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows that by the Sins of the Elect were due to them, and ſo there was a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionableneſs betwixt the Sorrows that he bare, and the Sorrows they ſhould have endured; he took up the cup of Wrath that was filled for us, and that we would have been put to drink, and drank it out himſelf; ſuppoſe that our Lord had never died (as bleſſed be his Name, there is no ground to make the ſuppoſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rrow that the Elect would have drunken eternally, was the ſame cup that he drank our for them: It is true, we would diſtinguiſh betwixt theſe things that are <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially</hi> due to Sin as the puniſhment of it; and theſe things that are only <hi>accidentally</hi> due to it, the former Chriſt bare but not the latter; To clear both in a word or two, 1. Theſe things eſſentially due to Sin as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarly included in the Threatning. <hi>The day thou eateſt thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> and in the curſe of the Law according to that, <hi>Curſed is every one that abides not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them,</hi> are Death and the Curſe, theſe are eſſentially the deſert of Sin; in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it was not only neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould become Man and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>uld die, and not only ſo, but that he ſhould die the curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death of the Croſs, as the Threatning and Curſe put together hold out; and as to all theſe things that he underwent and met with before, and at his death, they were the accompliſhment of the Threatning due to us, and fulfilled in and by him in our room; ſo that as he himſelf ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26. <hi>O fools and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken, ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things and to have entered into his glory?</hi> therefore he behoved to be in an Agony, and to ſweat great drops of Blood, to be crucified and die, and to be laid in the Grave. 2. Theſe things which we call accidentally due to Sin, are mainly two, 1. That horrible deſperation of the damned in He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l, where they gnaw their tongues for pain and blaſpheme God; This we ſay is not properly and eſſentially the deſert of Sin, but only accidental; 1. In reſpect of the Creatures inability to bear the wrath that Sin deſerveth, and hence ariſeth not only a ſinleſs horrour which is natural, but a ſinful deſperation. 2. Add to this inability of the Creature, the enmity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whereby it cometh to thwart with and contradict the will of God; hence the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation not only ariſeth but is increaſed: Now, our Lord Jeſus not being ſimply a Creature or a Man, but God and Man in one Perſon, he was able to bear the ſorrow and wrath due to the Elect for their Sin; and and there being no quarrel, nor ground of any quarrel betwixt God and him on his own account, though he had a natural and ſinleſs horrour at the cup of his Fathers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure when put to his head; yet he had no ſinful deſperation. The 2d. thing acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally due to Sin, is the eternal duration of Wrath or of the Curſe, becauſe the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being a meer Creature, cannot at one ſhoke meet with the infinite Wrath of God, and ſatisfie Juſtice at once, therefore the Lord hath in his Wiſdom and Juſtice found
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:152256:89"/> out a way of ſupporting the Creature in its beeing, and continuing it for ever under wrath, becauſe it cannot, being finit, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie infinite Juſtice: But our Lord being God and Man, being of infinite worth or value, and of infinite ſtrength, was alſo to ſatisfie Juſtice, and bear at once, that which the El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct could never have born; yet he had the eſſentials of that which ſin deſerved, to wit, death and the curſe to meet with, and did actually meet with them, as the hiding of his Fathers face, and the ſuſpending and keeping back of that conſolation, that by vertue of the perſonal union flowed from the God-head to the Man-head; And he alſo had the actual ſenſe and feeling of the wrath of God, the awaked Sword of the Juſtice of God actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſmiting him; ſo that men wondered how he could be dead ſo ſoon. We ſhall only add a word or two of reaſons for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confirming the Doctrine; and for proof of it, theſe three things concur, 1. That ſins deſerving by God's appointment, is to have ſorrow following on it. 2 That by God's appointment according to the Covenant of Redemption, the Son of God undertook that ſame very debt that was due by the Elect. And 3. That it was God's deſign not to paſs one of their ſins without ſatisfaction made to Juſtice, but to put at the Cautioner for them all; for the declaration of the riches and glory of the free grace of God when the ſinner is libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, and not put to pay; An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the holy ſeverity and juſtice of God, when not one farthing is owing, but the Cautioner muſt needs pay it, and that both theſe meeting together, there may be to all generations a ſtanding and ſhining e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the unſearchable riches both of Gods Grace and of his Juſtice.</p>
            <p>This is a ſweet Doctrine, and hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maſſie, ſubſtantial, and ſoul refreſhing uſes: Out of this eater comes meat, and out of the ſtrong comes ſweet; This being the very marrow of the Goſpel, holding out not only Chriſts ſufferings, but that he ſuffered not at randome or by gueſs, but that he ſuffered the ſorrows and griefs that we ſhould have ſuffered; and though the equivalent might have been received, yet he would needs undergo the ſame ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in their eſſentials: Which may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly confirm the Faith and Hope of believers in him, of their exemption and freedom from the wrath and curſe of God, ſeing he ſuffered the ſame that they ſhould have ſuffered, had not he interpoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and it as their Cautioner and Surety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Hereby we may know what an evil and bitter thing ſin is that hath ſuch effects; Would God we could once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail this far with you, as to make you take up and believe, that ſin hath ſorrow and grief inſeparably knit to it, and that the ſinner is miſerable and liable to death, and to the curſe of God, and there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence but this, that ſinners are inſenſible how miſerable they are, and ſo in greater capacity to be made obnoxious to that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; Do ye mind this, O ſinners, <hi>that God is angry with you every day?</hi> That <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and wrath, tribulation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh is to every ſoul of man that does evil?</hi> That <hi>God will by no means clear the guilty?</hi> Tremble to think upon it; Many of you paſs as gay honeſt folks who will be found in this Roll: And would ye know your condition, and the hazard that ye run? It's of wrath and of the curſe of God eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally with deſperation and blaſphemy; And if that be miſery, ſin is miſery, or brings it; And the day comes when there ſhall be a ſtorm from Heaven of Fire and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; that will melt the Elements above you, and not leave a ſtone upon a ſtone of theſe ſtately buildings on earrh about you; in which day ſinners will be confirmed in the belief of this truth, <hi>That it is an evil and bitter thing to depart from the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To preſs this <hi>Uſe</hi> a little; There are two ſorts of ſinners, who, if they would ſoberly let the truth of this Doctrine ſink in their minds, they would ſee their folly: The 1. ſort are theſe who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:152256:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> Ye that will grant ye are ſinners, and are under convictions of ſin, ye had need to take heed what is following it; As ye trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up ſin, ye are <hi>treaſuring up wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of wrath;</hi> O! wrath is a heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in ſtore for you. A 2. ſort are theſe that go on in ſin whatever be ſaid to the effects of it; and will confidently put their hand to it, as if there were no ſting in it at all, and drink it over as ſo much ſweet liquor, but of theſe ſtoln drinks that ſeem ſweet in ſecreet, will be vomited up again with pain, torment and ſorrow; and either it ſhall be grief and ſorrow to you in the way of repentance, or eternal grief and ſorrow when the cup of Gods wrath ſhall be put in your hand, and held to your head for evermore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. By this ye may ſee a neceſſity of making uſe of the Mediator Chriſt Jeſus; It's Gods great mercy that he hath given a Mediator, and that the Mediator is come, and that he hath taken on our debt: What had been our eternal periſhing and wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Hells torments with Devils, to his ſufferings? Alwayes this Doctrine ſaith that there is a neceſſity of making uſe of him, and receiving of him; And therefore either reſolve to meet with this ſorrow in your own perſons, or betake you to him, that by his interpoſing it may be kept off you; Weigh theſe two, that ſorrow, death, and the curſe, neceſſarily follow ſin; And that Jeſus Chriſt h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe words (as we ſhew) hold forth theſe three, 1. The cauſe or end of Chriſts ſuffering <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows;</hi> which is to remove and take away the ſcandal that might ariſe from Chriſts Humiliation, deſcribed in the foregoing words; He was low indeed but there was no guilt found in his mouth; It was for no quarrel that God had at himſelf, but he undertook our debt, and therefore carried our ſorrows. 2. The aggravation of mens enmity, and deſperat wickedneſs, that yet notwithſtanding of all this, <hi>We esteemed him ſmitten of God, and a flicted.</hi> 3. We have the Expoſition of the firſt part more clearly ſet down, <hi>But he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. Where more fully he expounds what in the beginning of the 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> he aſſerted.</p>
            <p>We expounded the firſt part of the words, and ſhew that theſe griefs and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows held forth the due deſert of ſin, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>ours,</hi> becauſe they are the due and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deſert of our ſins, and that which they procured, and that Chriſt's bearing of them, was not only meant of his taking away, or removing from us of ſorrows and griefs, as he did diſeaſes, but of his real undergoing of that which we ſhould have undergone, even ſuch a bearing as made others think him ſmitten and plagued of God, and ſuch as wounded and bruiſed him, even ſuch as made him become a curſe for us, and ſuch as procured healing to us; All which proves that it was a re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l undergoing of ſorrow and grief.</p>
            <p>We ſpoke to two <hi>Doctrines</hi> from this part, 1. That ſin hath ſorrow neceſſarily knit to it, and never wanteth ſorrow fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing on it. 2. That Chriſt Jeſus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took theſe ſame ſorrows, and really bare theſe ſame griefs that ſin procured to the Elect, or that by ſin were due to them.</p>
            <p>That we may proceed to obſerve ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, and for clearer acceſs to the Doctrine, we ſhall ſpeak a word to a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that may be moved here.</p>
            <p>What is meant by theſe words, <hi>our, we,</hi> and <hi>us?</hi> He hath born <hi>our</hi> griefs, the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of <hi>us</hi> all, by his ſtripes <hi>we</hi> are healed?

            <p>For 1. We are to expound this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal with reſpect to Gods purpoſe and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the contrivance of the Elects Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and to the death of Chriſt, the execution of it, and ſo theſe words <hi>our, us, we, all</hi> are, and muſt be reſtricted to theſe, and in them we are to find out who they are: Now, who theſe are, we find clear, <hi>John</hi> 6.37, 39. In the 37. <hi>v.</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>All that the Father hath given me ſhall come unto me,</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 39. <hi>This is the Fathers will which hath ſent me, that of all
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152256:91"/> which he hath given me I ſhould loſe nothing;</hi> It's in a word theſe whom the Father hath given to Chriſt, and as many as are given will believe: And certainly theſe that are given to Chriſt to be redeemed by him, are the ſame whoſe iniquities the Father makes to meet on him; And theſe are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from theſe not given, <hi>John</hi> 17.6, 11. And are called <hi>his ſheep. Joh.</hi> 10.15, and 17. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I lay down my life,</hi> to wit, for my ſheep: And all the ſtrain of this Chapter being to ſhew Gods way of contriving and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the work of Redemption, and Chriſts executing thereof according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption; All this ſpoken of Chriſts ſuffering muſt be expounded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ingagement. 2. Whereas it is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>For the tranſgreſſions of my people was he stricken;</hi> It is certain, this <hi>our</hi> and <hi>us</hi> and <hi>we</hi> for whom Chriſt was ſtricken, muſt be reſtricted to Gods people; That is his peculiar people who are his by elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them to me;</hi> They are not his as all the World are his, but are contradiſtinguiſhed from the world as his own peculiar, purpoſed, deſigned peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Sure all the World are not God's People in this ſenſe, therefore they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>his ſheep,</hi> and contradiſtinguiſhed from theſe who are not his ſheep, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17. And therefore we are to look on theſe words, <hi>our, us,</hi> and <hi>we,</hi> as of equivalent extent with <hi>the peculiar people of God;</hi> He carried the puniſhment of the ſins of all Gods people that are his peculiar election. 3. So <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed;</hi> Hence we gather this, that theſe whoſe iniquities Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iſt bare, are Chriſts Seed, and for theſe he purpoſely laid down his life, as theſe whom he expected ſhould be ſaved for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of him for the travel of his ſoul, and for no moe, and theſe cannot certainly be all the World, there being ſuch contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt Chriſt Myſtical, or his Seed comprehending the Elect, And the Seed of the Serpent comprehending the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probat and Wicked, who are ſaid <hi>to be of their father the Devil;</hi> Theſe are Chriſts Seed who are ſpiritually begotten of him, and theſe doubtleſs are not all the World, and for theſe only he ſuffered; So that <hi>our</hi> ſins here, are the ſins of all the Seed. 4. Look to <hi>v.</hi> 11. where it is ſaid, <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their iniquities:</hi> Where it is clear whoſe ſins they are that Chriſt bears; it's theirs who are juſtified by his knowledge, or by faith in his blood, and juſtification by faith in his blood, and redemption by his blood, are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable, and of equal extent: Now, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain as to the event, that not all the World, nor all in the viſible Church, are juſtified by the Faith of Chriſt, it muſt alſo be certain that the ſins of others who are not, nor ſhall not be juſtified, were never purpoſly born by Chriſt: And this ground as all the reſt, will be the more clear, if we conſider that it is given as an Argument why they muſt be juſtified, becauſe he hath born their iniquities. A 5. ground may be gathered from the laſt words of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>He made interceſſion for the tranſgreſsours;</hi> Whence we may reaſon, that Chriſt's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion and his ſatisfaction, are of equal extent, he ſatisfies for no moe then he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceeds for; Now, it was not for all the World, nor indefinitely and by gueſs for all in the viſible Church that Chriſt did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, <hi>but for them that the Father had given him</hi> out of the world, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 9. and <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me:</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>All mine are thine, and thine are mine;</hi> Chriſts death being the ground of his interceſſion, and it being by vertue of his death that he interceeded, his death and interceſſion muſt be of the ſame extent; He interceeds for ſuch and ſuch ſinners, becauſe he hath payed a price for them, that there may be a good account made of them at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>The 1. <hi>Uſe</hi> of it ſerves to clear a great and precious truth concerning Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and diſcriminating love whereby he hath put difference betwixt ſome and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. 2. It ſerves to ſtir them up who are thus differenced, to admire at, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his love, who hath been graciouſly mindful of them when others are paſt by.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:152256:91"/> 3. It ſerves alſo to clear other Scriptures, and this ſame Chapter, and to teach us, not to make common to all, the priviledges beſtowed on ſome peculiar ones; and to guard us againſt the vilifying and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our Lords ſufferings, as if he had no ſpecial and peculiar deſign in them, or as if they might be fruſtrated in the deſign of them contrary to the promiſes made to him of the Father.</p>
            <p>And therefore here to obviat an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which is made from the 6 <hi>verſ. All we like ſheep have gone aſtray;</hi> Whence ſome would infer, that it's all who like ſheep have ſtrayed, whoſe iniquities Chriſt hath born; We ſay, that, that <hi>all</hi> is not meant to comprehend them whoſe iniquities Chriſt hath born only, but to hold out the extent of ſtraying; or, the meaning is not to ſhew that his ſuffering and ſatisfying of Juſtice, extended to all that ſtrayed; but to ſhew that the Elect for whom he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had all of them ſtrayed, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; And this is like the reaſoning which the Apoſtle hath, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>If one died for all, then were all dead;</hi> The meaning whereof is not, that Chriſt died for all that were dead, but this is the meaning, that all for whom Chriſt died were once dead: ſo here while it's ſaid, <hi>All we like ſheep have gone aſtray;</hi> It is to ſhew that the Elect ſtrayed and eſteemed him not as well as others, and had Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This whole Chapter then being ſo Goſpel like, and having a direct fulfilling in Chriſt, we may draw this general Doctrine from it.</p>
            <p>That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt who was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was crucified, died, and was buried, and roſe again the third day; is the very ſame <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of in the Old Teſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing of it ſhall aſtrict our ſelv s to this Chapter; the argument runneth thus, if in Chriſt Jeſus, that which was propheſied of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and promiſed to the Fathers, have its ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling and accompliſhment; then he muſt be the ſame <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that was propheſied of, and promiſed to them; for theſe things ſpoken of the one and alone <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> can agree to no other. But whatever was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied and ſpoken or promiſed of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> to the Fathers, to the leaſt circumſtance of it, was all fully accompliſhed and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt; therefore the concluſion laid down in the Doctrine follows, to wit, that our bleſſed Lord Jeſus is the ſame <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that was propheſied of, promiſed to the Fathers, and whom they before his coming were looking for: So that that queſtion needs not now to be propoſed <hi>art thou he that ſhould come, or do we look <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as come under for them; and theſe ſame Scriptures which we cited to confirm theſe, will confirm this: The reaſon why we would have you confirmed in this, is, Becauſe, 1 It is only this that will make you ſuitably thankful, it is this which is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ground of that Song of Praiſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4. <hi>To him that hath loved us and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood,</hi> &amp;c. 2. This is a ground of true, ſolid, and ſtrong conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even to be comforted in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faith of Chriſts purchaſe. 3. It is the Lords allowance on his People, which they ſhould reverently and thankfully make uſe of, even to look on Jeſus Chriſt, as wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pierced, and lifted up on the Croſs for
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:152256:95"/> them; and by doing this according to his allowance, there is a paved way made for application of all the benefites of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the ſcope (looking on the words as ſpoken to remove the ſcandal of the Croſs) <hi>Obſerve</hi> (which may be a reaſon of the former) that folk will never take up Chriſt rightly in his ſufferings, except they take him up as ſuffering for them, and in their room; This look of Chriſt, leads 1. To take up much of the glory of grace, and condeſcending love to ſinners. 2. It leads to take up Chriſts faithfulneſs, that came to the world on ſinners errand according to the ancient tranſaction in the Covenant of Redemption, as he is brougbt in ſaying <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>Lo I come in the volume of thy book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will O God.</hi> 3. It leads to a ſtayed look of Gods Holineſs, Juſtice, and Goodneſs, in exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfaction of his own Son, and in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of that ſatisfaction. 4. It gives a right view of the way of grace, and leads in to ſee it to be a moſt real thing; God the offended Party accepting of the price, and Chriſt paying it: Thus the Believers Faith gets a ſight of Chriſt ſatisfying as if he ſaw his own debt ſatisfied by himſelf; It ſees him undergoing the curſe and juſtice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting it on him, that the Believer may go free.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to ſhew the neceſſity of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying the well-grounded application of Chriſts ſufferings as for us; much of the reaſon why Chriſt is not more pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>zed lies here, that he is not looked on as paying our debt; otherwiſe when challenges of the Law and of Juſtice take hold on the Soul, if Chriſt were ſeen interpoſing, and ſaying, <hi>A body haſt thou prepared unto me;</hi> And if Juſtice were ſeen exacting, Chriſt perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and God accepting his ſatisfaction, and that in ſign and token that Juſtice is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, he is raiſed from the dead, juſtified in the Spirit, and is entered in poſſeſſion of Glory as Believers fore-runner in their name; it would afford precious and lovely thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt, and humbling thoughts of our ſelves; Therefore there is a neceſſity, if we would conſider his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings aright, and prize and eſteem him, that we endeavour to make particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them to our ſelves on good grounds. 2. Upon the other hand, know, ye who have no ground to make this appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that ye cannot eſteem aright of him or his ſufferings, nor of the grace that ſhined in them, becauſe ye have no title to, nor can while ſuch, have any clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of intereſt in them. 3. For you that would fain have a high eſteem of Chriſt, and yet are all your days caſting at this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, never think nor expect to win right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to eſteem of him, ſo long as ye ſcarr to make application of his purchaſe; And therefore that ye may love and praiſe him, and eſteem rightly of him, labour to come up to the making of this application on ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and approved grounds.</p>
            <p n="4">4. More particularly from this part of the aggravation, <hi>Yet we eſteemed him ſtricken, ſmitten of God, and afflicted;</hi> We have a fourfold confirmation of truth, or four pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious truths confirmed. 1. That our Lord Jeſus in his ſufferings did really ſuffer, and was really brought low in his ſufferings, ſo as on-lookers thought him a moſt deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable man, and one that was ſtricken and ſmitten of God, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fflicted: Of this we ſpoke on the beginning of the 4. <hi>verſe.</hi> 2. We have here an evidence of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great freeneſs of grace, and of the love of Chriſt in his ſufferings, in ſo far as he bare their ſorrows, and payed their debt that counted him ſmitten; There was no good thing in us to deſerve or procure his ſufferings, But moſt freely he under-went theſe ſufferings, and undertook our debt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>God commends his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us;</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>While we were yet enemies we were reconciled by the death of his Son:</hi> Can there be a greater proof of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and free love then appears in our Lords ſufferings?

            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:152256:95"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Conſider here, behold and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the free love of God, and rich con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending love of Chriſt, he ſtands not at the Barr and prays for them that were praying him to pray for them; But as it is in the end of the Chapter, it was for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours; It was even for ſome of them that were ſeeking to take away the life of the Prince of Life, and for other tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Know that in them to whom the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of Chriſts death is applied, there is no more worth then there is in others who do not ſhare of the benefite of it: It's the opinion not only of Hereticks, but ſome way of many ignorant Profeſſors; That theſe for whom Chriſt died were better then others; But here we ſee a proof of the contrary; He dies for them that accounted him ſmitten of God: And this he doth for two reaſons, 1. To ſhew the riches and freedom of his grace, that could overcome mans evil and malice, and outreach the hight of the deſperat wickedneſs that is in man, and that that ſtands not (to ſpeak ſo) on ſtepping-ſtones, but comes over the greateſt gulfs of ſin and enmity in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 2. To comfort &amp; encourage his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers when engaged to him, againſt and out over their groſſeſt failings and greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages; He that loved them when they were deſpiſing and rejecting him, and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a manner in his very face, Will he now give up with them when they have ſome love to him, for this or that corrup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſtirreth or breaketh forth in them? Thus the Apoſtle reaſons, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>If when we were enemies we were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life:</hi> We were enemies when Chriſt gave himſelf for us, but thorow grace we are ſomewhat better now; Enmity and deſpite in us was then at an hight, now it is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, reſtrained, and in ſome meaſure mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified: And if while we were at the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght of enmity againſt him he died for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us to God, How much more now being reconciled, may we expect peace and ſafetie, and all the benefits of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe thorow him? Thus there is a notable conſolation, from this bent of malice that was ſometime in us, compared with the victory that grace hath now gotten over it; and the gradation is alwayes comfortable, to wit, that theſe luſts that once did reign, and were without any gracious oppoſition made to them, or any proteſtation entered againſt them, prevailing it may be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, are now oppoſed and proteſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; And if Chriſt ſtood not on the greater, will he ſtand on the leſſer? And our Lord allows this ſort of reaſoning ſo much the more, that he may thereby ſtrongly engage the heart of the believer againſt ſin, and to the admiring of grace, and withall to the ſerious ſtudy of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3, It ſerves to let you know how much ye Believers are engaged and obliged to Grace, and what thanks you owe to it. 1. Look to what ſatisfies for your debt, ye pay not one farthing of it, our Lord Jeſus payed all. 2. Look to the moving cauſe, it's to be attributed to nothing in you, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to free grace: Some poor Dyvour may by his pleading prevail with an able and pitiful-hearted man to pay his debt; But there was no ſuch externally moving cauſe in you to procure this of him, but he freely and willingly, and with delight pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your debt when ye were in the hight of malicious oppoſition to him, doing all that might ſcarr him from it; And had it been poſſible that man's malice, deſpiſing, and deſpite could have ſcarred him, he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver died for one ſinner, but he triumphed openly in his grace over that and all that ſtood in his way. 3. We have here a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of that truth that holds out mans malice and deſperat wickedneſs, And can there be any thing that evidenceth man's wickedneſs and malice more? Then 1. To have enmity againſt Chriſt. 2. To have it at ſuch an hight as to deſpiſe him, and count him ſmitten and plagued of God. And 3. To be at the hight of malice even then when he out of love was condeſcending ſo low as to ſuffer and ſatisfie Juſtice for him; ye may poſſibly think that it was not ye that had ſuch malice at Chriſt; But ſaith not the Prophet, <hi>We eſteemed him ſmitten of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:152256:96"/> God?</hi> Taking in himſelf and all the elect, which might give us this <hi>Obſervation,</hi> That there is nothing more deſperatly wicked, and filled with more enmity againſt Chriſt in his condeſcending love, and againſt God in the manifeſtation of his grace, then when even elect ſouls for whom he hath ſuffered, deſpiſe him, and count him ſmitten of God and afflicted: It's indeed very ſad, yet very profitable, to walk under the deep ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and ſoul-preſſour of heart-enmity againſt God and Chriſt: Are there any of you that think ye have ſuch ſinful and wicked natures that diſpoſe you to think little of Chriſt, to deſpiſe and reject him and his grace? Gods Elect have this enmity in their natures; And if ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be in the Elect, what muſt be in the Reprobat who live and die in this enmity? If this were ſeriouſly conſidered and laid to heart, O but folk would be humble, nothing would affect the ſoul more, and ſtound to the very heart, then to think that Chriſt ſuffered for me, through grace an Elect and a Believer, and that yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>I</hi> ſhould have ſo deſpiſed and rejected him, and accounted him ſmitten of God and afflicted; Let me exhort all of you to look back on your former walk, and to lay this enmity to heart, for the day is coming when it will be found to be a biting, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence gnawing ſin to many.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In that he aggravates their enmity from this, <hi>Obſerve</hi> this truth which is alſo here confirmed, that there is nothing that gives ſin a deeper Dye, then that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt grace and condeſcending love, that is, againſt Chriſt when ſuffering for us, and offered to us; O! that makes ſin to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinful, and wonderfully abominable, and thus it is aggreged, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. As greater then the contempt of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law; And <hi>Heb</hi> 6.

               </gap>ing deſpite to the Spirit of Grace; Theſe two laſt Scriptures look mainly to the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, yet ſo as there is ſomewhat of that which is ſaid in them to be found in all unbelievers their deſpiſing of Chriſt; It's a ſin ſome way hateful, even to the Publicans and Sinners to hate them that love us, to do ill to them that do good to us; How much more ſinful and hateful is it to deſpiſe and hate him who loved us ſo as to give himſelf for us, and when he was giving himſelf for us? There are many ſins againſt the Law that will draw deep, but this will draw deeper then they all, even ſinning againſt Grace, and the Mediator interpoſing for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and manifeſting love to them; And the reckoning will run thus, Chriſt was manifeſted to you in this Goſpel as the only remedy of ſin, and ſet forth as cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before your eyes, and made offer of to you in the Goſpel, and yet ye deſpiſed him, and eſteemed him not: And let me ſay it to Believers, that it's the greateſt aggravation of their ſin; It is true, in ſome reſpect that the ſins of Believers are not ſo great as the ſins of others, they not being committed with ſuch deliberation and full benſil of will, nor from the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſin, yet in this reſpect they are greater then the ſins of others, becauſe committed againſt ſpecial Grace and Love actually communicated; and therefore when the Believer conſiders that he hath requit Chriſt thus, it will affect him moſt of any thing, if there be any ſuitable ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of frame.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From conſidering that it is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that expreſſeth this aggravation, we may <hi>Obſerve,</hi> that the Believer that is moſt tender, and hath beſt right to Jeſus Chriſt and his ſatisfaction, and may upon beſt ground apply it, will be moſt ſenſible of his enmity, and of the abominable guilt that is in deſpiſing and wronging of Jeſus Chriſt; Therefore the Prophet brings in himſelf as one of thoſe that by Chriſts ſtripes were healed, taking with his guilt, <hi>we deſpiſed</hi> and rejected him, <hi>we</hi> eſteemed him not, <hi>we</hi> judged him ſmitten of God; The reaſon is, becauſe intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt makes the heart tender, and any wrong that's done to him to affect the ſooner and the more deeply, the ſcurf that ſometime was on the heart being in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:152256:96"/> taken away; and intereſt in Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakeneth and raiſeth an eſteem of him, and produceth a holy ſympathy with him in all the concerns of his glory, even as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body have a fellow-feeling with the head; Make a ſuppoſition, that a man in his madneſs ſhould ſmite and wound his head, or wrong his Wife, his Father, or his Brother; when that fit of madneſs is over, he is more affected with that wrong then if it had been done to any other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his body, or to other perſons not at all, or not ſo nearly related to him: There is ſomething of this pointed at, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall look unto him whom they have pierced, and mourn for him as a man doth for his only Son;</hi> As if he had ſaid, the ſtroaks they have given the head, ſhall then be very heavy and grievous to be born, and will be made to their feeling to bleed a-freſh; They thought not much of theſe woundings and piercings of him before, but ſo ſoon as their intereſt in him is clear, or they come cordially to believe in him, they are kindly affected with the wrongs done to him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> is, That it's a mark, to try if there be indeed an intereſt in Chriſt, and if it be clear; The man whoſe intereſt is cleareſt, 1. His wrongs done to Chriſt will prick him moſt, if the wrongs be done by others they affect him; if by himſelf they ſome way faint him; Wholeneſs of heart under wronging of Chriſt, is too great an evidence that there is little or no ground for application of his ſatisfaction, but it's kindly like, when wrongs done to Chriſt affect moſt. 2. When not only challenges for ſin againſt the Law, but for ſins againſt Chriſt and Grace offered in the Goſpel, do become a burden, and the greateſt burden. 3. When the man is made to mind ſecret enmity at Chriſt, and is diſpoſed to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter up aggravations of his ſinfulneſs on that account, and cannot get himſelf made vile enough; When he hath an holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at himſelf, and with <hi>Paul</hi> counts himſelf the <hi>chief of ſinners;</hi> Even thou h the evil was done in ignorance, much more if it hath been againſt knowledge; It's no evil token when ſouls are made to heap up aggravations of their guilt for wrongs done to Chriſt, and when they cannot get ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able expreſſions ſufficiently to hold it out, as it is an evil token to be ſoon ſatisfied in this; There are many that will take with no challenge for their wronging Chriſt, but behold here how the Prophet inſiſts, both in the words before, in theſe, and in the following words, and he can no more win off the thoughts of it, then he can win off the thoughts of Chriſts ſufferings.</p>
            <p n="6">6. While the Prophet ſaith, when Chriſt was ſuffering for his own, and for the reſt of his peoples ſins, <hi>We eſteemed him not,</hi> but judged him <hi>ſmitten of God; Obſerve</hi> briefly, becauſe we haſten to a cloſe, that Jeſus Chriſt is often exceedingly miſtaken by men in his moſt glorious and gracious works, can there be a greater miſtake then this? Chriſt ſuffering for our ſins, and yet judged ſmitten and plagued of God by us; Or more home, even Chriſt Jeſus is often ſhamefully miſtaken in the work of his Grace, and in the venting of his love towards them whoſe good he is procuring, and whoſe iniquities he is bearing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of it ſerves 1. To teach us when we are ready to paſs cenſure on Chriſts work, to ſtand ſtill, to animadvert on, and to correct our ſelves, leſt we unſuitably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct of him: He gets much wrong as to his publick work, as if he were cruel, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is merciful, as if he had forgotten us, when when indeed he remembers us ſtill: And as to his privat work in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, as if he did fail in his promiſe when he is moſt faithful, and bringing it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in his own way.

            <p>IT's hard to tell whether the Subject of this Verſe, and almoſt of this whole Chapter, be more ſad or more ſweet; It's indeed a ſad Subject to read and hear of the great Sufferings of our bleſſed Lord Jeſus, &amp; of the deſpiteful uſage that he met with, and to ſee ſuch a ſpeat of Malice ſpued and ſpitted out on that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous face; ſo that when he is bearing our Griefs &amp; carrying our Sorrows, we do even then account him plagued, ſmitten of God, and afflicted, and in a manner look upon it as well beſtowed: Yet it's a moſt ſweet Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject if we either conſider the love it comes from, or the comfortable effects that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; that hath been the riſe, the cauſe, and the occaſion of much ſinging to many here below, and is the cauſe and occaſion of ſo much ſinging among the redeemed that are this day before the Throne of God; and as the Grace of God hath overcome the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Men, ſo we are perſwaded this cauſe of rejoycing hath a ſweetneſs in it beyond the ſadneſs, though often we mar our own Spiritual Mirth, and know not how to dance when he pipes unto us.</p>
            <p>Theſe words are an explication of the 4th. <hi>Verſe,</hi> where it is aſſerted that Chriſts Sufferings were not for himſelf but for us; from, and by which the Prophet having ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greged Mens malice, who, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof eſteemed him not, yea judged ſmitten of God, he comes again for further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and carrying on of this Scope, to ſhew more particularly the ground, end, and effects of Chriſts Sufferings; where ye would remember what we hinted before in general, that Folks will never think nor conceive of Chriſts Sufferings rightly, till they conceive and take him up as ſuffering for them; and when we conſider this, we think it no wonder that the moſt part eſteem but little of the Sufferings of Chriſt, becauſe there are ſo few that can take him up under this notion, as ſtanding in their room, and paying their debt, and as being put in Priſon for them when they are let go free.</p>
            <p>In this 5th. <hi>Verſe,</hi> We have theſe three, 1. A further expreſſion of Chriſts Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. 2. The cauſe of them, or the end that he had before him in them. 3. The benefites and fruits or effects of them.</p>
            <p>There are in the words four expreſſions which I ſhall clear, 1. <hi>He was wounded,</hi> to ſhew the reality that was in his Sufferings, he was actually pierced, or as the word is rendered in the Margin, <hi>tormented,</hi> and the cauſe is, <hi>our tranſgreſſions;</hi> and while it is ſaid, <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions,</hi> he means, 1. That our Tranſgreſſions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his wounding, And 2. That his wounding was to remove them, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure pardon to us. 2. <hi>He was bruiſed,</hi> that is, preſſed as Grapes in a Wine-preſs, he under-went ſuch a wounding as bruiſed him; to ſhew the great deſert of Sin, and the heavineſs of wrath that would have come on us for it, had not he interpoſed; and the cauſe is <hi>our iniquities;</hi> And theſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:152256:97"/> two words <hi>tranſgreſſions</hi> and <hi>iniquities,</hi> ſhew the exceeding abominableneſs of Sin; <hi>Tranſgreſſions</hi> or Errings pointing at our common Sins, <hi>Iniquities</hi> or Rebellions point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at greater guilt. 3. <hi>The chaſtiſement,</hi> or as the words bear, the diſcipline <hi>of our peace was upon him;</hi> It ſuppoſes firſt, That we by nature were at feud with, and enemies to God. Secondly, That before our peace could be procured, there behoved to be a ſatisfaction given to Juſtice, the Mediator behoved to come under diſcipline and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement. 4. <hi>And by his ſtripes we are healed;</hi> he was ſo whipped, that to ſay ſo, the marks of the rod remained behind; the firſt benefite looks to pardon of Sin and Peace with God in the firſt three expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; the ſecond in this laſt expreſſion, looks to our Sanctification and purging from the dominion and pollution of Sin; By Chriſts becoming Sin for us, there is a way made to waſh us from all the guilt of Sin, and from all the foul ſpots and ſtains that were on us by Sin, and he hath thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured Holineſs to us; we come eaſily by it, but it coſt Chriſt dear, yea very dear.</p>
            <p>Theſe very ſad, but moſt ſweet, and Soul-ſolacing words, hold out a ſhort ſum of the ſubſtance and marrow of the Goſpel; and becauſe they do ſo, we ſhall ſpeak of them ſummarily together; and ye would the more ſeriouſly attend, eſpecially ſuch as are more ignorant, that by the reading and opening up of this <hi>Verſe</hi> ye may be brought and kept in mind of the ſum of the heads of the Goſpel; and to make the matter the more clear, I ſhall endeavour to make the Doctrines drawen from it, as ſo many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to ſix or ſeven queſtions, As 1. What is Mans condition naturally, and what is the condition of all them that get not benefite by Chriſts death? 2. How is Man redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fred from that condition? 3. By whom is he fred, or who makes the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction? 4. How doth he perform that Satisfaction? 5. What are the benefites that flow from, and come to us by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction performed? 6. Who are the Perſons for whom Chriſt hath performed the Satisfaction, and to whom he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured theſe Benefites? 7. What is the way how theſe Benefites are transferred or derived to theſe Perſons? And putting theſe ſeven together, we may have a ſhort Catechiſm in one Verſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, What is Mans condition by Nature. 1. He is under Tranſgreſſions. 2. Under Iniquities. 3. At feud with God. And 4ly. Under wounds and moſt loathſome Diſeaſes of a ſinful Nature: In a word, Man by Nature is a Sinner, guilty, greatly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, under Gods Wrath and Curſe, and at Feud with God, of a moſt ſinful and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable nature, even ſick of, and loathſome, becauſe of Sin; The firſt is implyed in this word, <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions,</hi> that is, our common Sins; The ſecond is holden out in the next word, <hi>He was bruiſed for our iniquities,</hi> or Rebellions, which holds out great guilt; The third in that word, <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was on him,</hi> which ſuppons that we were once without Peace with God; The laſt word, <hi>By his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> ſuppoſeth, that we continue in that condition filthy and polluted, and polluting our ſelves more and more, greedy to drink in Sin, and wounding and ſickning our ſelves by Sin; Now, lay theſe four words together, they clear this truth to our Judgment, and ſerve to point out to us the neceſſity of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Again, Conſider them in a ſecond no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they tell us, that even the Elect themſelves, are by Nature in the ſame ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and rebellious condition wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h others, at feud with, and under the Curſe of God, and abominably polluted before they be waſhed and healed, as the Apoſtle aſſerts <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>We are by nature children of wrath even as others;</hi> and here it is plainly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. Some are ready to think (as was hinted before) that the Elect by nature were better than others, or that God foreſaw they would be better, and therefore he elected them; This piece of <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> is in all n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>turally; but this Text in down-right contradiction to ſuch a groundleſs conceit, anſwers and aſſerts, that by nature they are even like others, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. <hi>God hath concluded them all under unbelief,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:152256:98"/> that he might have mercy on all;</hi> All the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, as well as others, are concluded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sin and Wrath, that the way of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Spiritual Good, might be by Mercy and Free-Grace alone.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How are Folks fred from this ſinful and miſerable condition? <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. In general, Before the quarrel can be taken away, and their peace can be made, there muſt be a Satisfaction, which is implyed in theſe words, <hi>the chaſtiſement of our peace was on him;</hi> which ſuppons the neceſſity of a Satisfaction made or to be made, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Gods decree and commination, who ſaid, <hi>the day thou ſins, thou ſhalt die,</hi> and <hi>curſed is every one that continues not in all things written in the law to do them.</hi> 2. And more particularly, There muſt be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, becauſe there is 1. The Juſtice of God that hath a claim by a ſtanding law. 2. The Holineſs of God that muſt be vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. And 3 The Faithfulneſs of God that muſt cauſe be performed and come to paſs what it hath impledged it ſelf for, as well in reference to the Threatning as to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; for theſe words, <hi>Hath he ſaid and will he not do it?</hi> relate to the one as well as to the other; there is a great miſtake in many while they leap immediatly to Mercy, without minding the neceſſity of a Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to provoked Juſtice, and on this ground that God is merciful, which if it were an argument good enough, it would ſay, that all, even the Reprobate may get Mercy; but we would conſider the way that God hath laid down for Sinners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mercy, and how that before peace can be made, he will needs have ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Who maketh the Satisfaction? The Text ſays, it's <hi>He</hi> and <hi>Him; He</hi> was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our trangreſſions, the chaſtiſement of our peace was on <hi>Him;</hi> and who is this <hi>He</hi> and <hi>Him?</hi> it's in general the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who was then to come, he who was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who ſuffered and was crucified, who died and was buried and roſe the third day; even he, who having the nature of God and our nature united in one Perſon. <hi>He his own ſelf bare our ſins in his body on the tree,</hi> as is ſaid 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. and <hi>He who knew no ſin, was made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> as it is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 <hi>ult.</hi> even he of whom the Apoſtle hath been ſpeaking here, while he ſays, <hi>We as ambaſſadours for Christ, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconcealed unto God:</hi> And when we ſay it's Chriſt that is mean'd of, we are to underſtand it as well negatively and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, excluding all others, as poſitively including him; when we make him to be the only Saviour, we exclude all that Men can do with their Penance, Prayers, Good-Works, and all that Angels can do, neither Man nor Angel could ſatisfie divine Juſtice, and make our Peace with God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>Neither is there ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we muſt be ſaved, but the name of Jeſus,</hi> where it's clear that all others are excluded, as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6. <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou wouldeſt not,</hi> &amp;c. neither Penance, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, nor any other thing will do it, but it's <hi>Lo I come in the volum of thy book, its written of me I delight to do thy will O my God.</hi> Take this then as another ground of Saving Knowledge, that it is our bleſſed Lord Jeſus that ſatisfies Juſtice, even he who being God, was content to become Man, and is God and Man in one Perſon, He, and he only undertaking the Debt, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How does he ſatisfie Juſtice? <hi>Anſ. He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was on him, and by his ſtripes we are healed:</hi> In which words, obſerve theſe three things, 1. In Chriſts ſatisfaction for us there is an actual undertaking, he becomes Cautioner and enters himſelf in our room; when all other things are caſten, Angels, Men with their Sacrifices, thouſands of Rams, ten thouſand rivers of Oil, and the fruit of the Body, then our Lord Jeſus comes in and undertakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7. <hi>Lo, I come,</hi> he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies for our Tranſgreſſions; which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that Juſtice could not have ſought our Debt of him if he had not undertaken it; therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.24. He is called <hi>the ſurety
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:152256:98"/> of a better teſtament,</hi> for he comes in our room and place, and undertakes to pay our Debt; even as if a man under Debt were a carrying to Priſon, and another able rich man ſhould undertake to pay the Debt; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Debt ſhould ly over for a while unpayed, yet the Creditor will get a Decreet on the Cautioner for payment of the Debt when he pleaſes to put at him; ſo Jeſus Chriſt enters Cautioner for our Debt, and becomes lyable to the payment of it. 2. Chriſts performance and payment of the Debt according to his undertaking, implys a Covenant and Tranſaction on which the application is founded, which we ſhew was alſo implyed in the foregoing words, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>He hath born our griefs and carried our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows:</hi> God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, are the Party wronged by Sin; Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt conſidered perſonally and as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, is the Party undertaking: The terms are, that he ſhall ſuffer and ſatisfie Juſtice for us, and that we ſhall go free; that his paying ſhall be our freedom, that the Debt which he pays for us ſhall not be exacted off us our ſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. He who knew no ſin, was made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in Him;</hi> and here, <hi>the chaſtiſement of our peace was on him;</hi> it was transferred from us to him, <hi>that by his ſtripes we might be healed;</hi> by his ſtripes and blanes health was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and brought to us. 3. Our Lord Jeſus in fulfilling the Bargain and ſatisfying Juſtice, payed a dear price; it was at a very dear rate that he bought our freedom; He was wounded, bruiſed, ſuffered ſtripes and puniſhment: So that ye may take the anſwer to the queſtion in ſum to be this, our Lord Jeſus performed and ſatisfied for all that was due by us, by undertaking our Debt and paying a dear price for Sinners according to the Covenant of Redemption; He came under the Law, and the Law ſtruck at him as Cautioner, and he anſwered the Laws demands, and fully and condiguly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the Juſtice of God for us.</p>
            <p>As for that <hi>Queſtion,</hi> Whether Chriſt might not by one drop of his blood have ſatisfied? and ſuch like, we think them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry needleſs, too curious, and little or not at all edifying: But if it be aſked, why Chriſt payed ſo much? we anſwer, 1. It behoved Chriſt to pay a condign price, to give a condign ſatisfaction to Juſtice. 2. It was meet that he ſhould pay all that he payed. Firſt, We ſay, it behoved to be a condign ſatisfaction, For, 1. It behoved to be a price equivalent to all that the Elect ſhould have ſuffered, had not he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed. 2. It behoved to be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the Juſtice of God, for God having laid down ſuch a way of ſhewing Mercy, that his Juſtice ſhould be ſalved, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to be condign ſatisfaction for the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of Juſtice; which was done by Chriſts ſuffering to the full undoubtedly; if we conſider, 1. The excellency of the Perſon that ſuffered, God and Man in one Perſon. 2. If we conſider the nature of his Sufferings, that they were exceeding great, heavy, and preſſing. And 3. If with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all we conſider the manner of his Sufferings, that it was with much readineſs and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of obedience to the Fathers will: That ſuch and ſo excellent a Perſon ſhould ſuffer, and ſuffer ſo much, and ſuffer in ſuch a way, this ſure makes a condign Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and ſo Juſtice is fully thereby ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and made as glorious as if all the Elect had ſuffered eternally; therefore we ſay, that his ſufferings were a condign and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable ſatisfaction to Juſtice for them whoſe Debt he payed, by this Juſtice is compleatly and gloriouſly ſatisfied. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, We ſaid that it was meet that he ſhould pay all that he payed, and ſo it is, if we conſider, 1. The excellency of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls, a little price (as all that Men or Angels could have payed would have been, the fineſt Gold, Silver, and precious Stones) could not have done it, <hi>the redemption of the ſoul is precious, and ceaſeth for ever,</hi> to wit, amongſt all the Creatures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.8. 2. The ſeverity of Juſtice on the juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Sin, called for ſuch a price. 3. Gods end, which was to make both his Grace and Juſtice glorious, required, and made it meet that our Lord ſhould ſuffer condignly, and in his Sufferings ſuffer much, even all that he did ſuffer: And in this ye have an anſwer to this queſtion, why Chriſt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:152256:99"/> ſuffered ſo much, as the loſs (to ſpeak ſo) of his declarative glory for a time, outward ſufferings and inward ſufferings even the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The benefits are ſuch, that if he had not ſuffered for us, we ſhould have ſuffered all that he ſuffered our ſelves. 2. More particularly, we have 1. Peace and Pardon of Sin. 2. Healing by his Sufferings, ſo that if it be aſked, what procured pardon of Sin and peace with God? We anſwer, it's Chriſts Sufferings; Or if it be aſked, what is the cauſe of Gods juſtifying Sinners? We anſwer, it's Chriſts ſatisfaction or ſuffering; and it is (by the way) much to be regrated, that ſuch is the ignorance of ſome, that if a queſtion be proponed in divers words or expreſſions, as if it ſhould be aſked, wherefore are we pardoned? wherefore are we juſtified? which is one and the ſame they know not how to anſwer; but here ye are called to remember, that Chriſts being wounded, and his bearing the chaſtiſement due to you, is the cauſe of your Pardon and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2.

            <p>This points at theſe two or three things very uſeful, 1. That the Elect are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and before Chriſt do them good, no better than others. 2. It ſhews the freedom of the Grace of God that comes over that, and freely gives pardon, peace, and healing to them: And 3ly. It ſerves to ſtrengthen a Sinners Faith, who is ſenſible of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and ſinfulneſs, and to be a ground of encouragement to him, to ſtep to, and lay hold on Chriſts purchaſe, becauſe it was for ſuch that he died; he may humbly, yet confidently ſay, Chriſt died even for ſuch as me, for them that wounded and pierced him by their tranſgreſſions and iniquities, for them that were at enmity with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and alace I am ſuch, and will therefore on the call of the Goſpel come to him, and on his own terms endeavour to caſt my ſelf on him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. How are theſe benefites, this Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Pardon of Sin, Peace and Healing, and all that is comprehended under them, derived from Chriſt to the Sinner that by Faith fleeth unto him for refuge? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Theſe two generals will clear it. 1. They are derived to us <hi>juſtly</hi> and in a legal way; Chriſt ſteps in in our room, that we may come in his room. 2. They are derived to us <hi>freely,</hi> he was wounded and bruiſed that we might go free; he endured ſtripes that we might be healed; he got the buffets and bare the burden, and we get the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, there is not a grain weight of it laid on us as it is ſatisfactory to divine Juſtice.</p>
            <p>To clear this a little more anent the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving the benefits of Chriſts purchaſe to us, there muſt be a reſpect had, 1. To the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption, the ground of his ſuffering for us. 2. To the Covenant of Grace and Reconciliation wherein the offer of theſe Sufferings, and the benefits pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by them to us, and the terms of both is made.</p>

            <p>But it may be <hi>objected</hi> here, What, are we then abſolved from the very time of Chriſts death and forward?

In the 40.

            <p n="2">2. Reſpect muſt be had to the Covenant of Grace, which is not quite an other thing then the Covenant of Redemption, but the making offer of it and the benefits contained in it in the preached Goſpel, when Chriſt ſends out his Ambaſſadours to woo and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite Sinners to Chriſt, and to bring them to the application of his Purchaſe; and it is by cloſing with, and receiving of Chriſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that the actual Cure comes, and that by Chriſts ſtripes our ſores are healed: Even as when a Child that was <hi>Minor</hi> becomes <hi>Major,</hi> he comes to have a right to poſſeſs the ſame Lands or Sums of Money by the ſame Law that gave him a legal or ſimple right to them before; or he comes to have a right <hi>in</hi> that, which before he had a right <hi>to:</hi> So elect Souls that have a right to Chriſts purchaſe before believing, while they are mad in nature, are under the curſe and wrath threatned in the word of God for not believing; but when they come to believe, they come to get an extract from the ſame word of their right <hi>in</hi> Chriſts pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, becauſe the Word ſays, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, is paſt from death to life, and ſhall not come into condemnation;</hi> and ſo the ſame word that did condemn before believing, doth now abſolve upon a Sinners believing; and we come at this abſolution by receiving of Chriſts offer in the Covenant of Grace: And if it be aſked, how comes it that the receiving of Chriſts free offer in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Grace, gives a right to Chriſts pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe? we anſwer, It is by vertue of the Covenant of Redemption, wherein it is ſo tranſacted betwixt God and the Mediator; ſo that there is the offer of the Covenant received, and the Covenant it ſelf that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur for making over and deriving a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Right to wretched Sinners in Chriſts purchaſe.</p>
            <p>Let the 1. <hi>Uſe</hi> of this be for your inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and information, which is the end wherefore we have choſen in this way by this ſhort view to give you in a very ſhort ſum, the marrow of the Goſpel; And if ye remember theſe few Queſtions, ye may be in a capacity not only to anſwer us, but through grace to exerciſe Faith on Chriſt; And we think ye will all readily grant, that theſe who cannot at all anſwer them, ſhould not go to the Communion: And therefore that ye may take them with you, we ſhall ſhortly reſume them. 1. What condition is man in by nature? Anſwer, Under ſin and miſery, and even under the curſe of God; Or thus, every man is a ſinner, and hath a ſinful nature, or, he is under tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and iniquities, is naturally loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, wants peace with God, and hath need of healing; Let this in the firſt place ſink in your hearts. 2. How is man freed from this ſinfulneſs and miſery! Anſwer, He cannot be free from it, till there be a condign ſatisfaction made to Divine Juſtice; wounding and bruiſing muſt be to procure pardon, and ſtripes muſt be to procure healing, and chaſtiſement muſt be to bring about our peace; That word, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. <hi>Who will by no means acquit the guilty,</hi> would alwayes be remembred, and Faith would look to a Saviour for ſatisfaction. 3. Who can ſatisfie? Anſwer, Neither Man nor Angel can do it, no penances, no prayers nor performances of any meer creature will do it, but <hi>He</hi> only that was wounded and bruiſed, He who by Nature is the Son of God, the expreſs Image of the Fathers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and who in reſpect of His Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> like to us in all things except ſin; It's he that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Juſtice and it's by no other way that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:152256:100"/> we get pardon, and peace with God, and Holineſs. 4. What way doth Chriſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Juſtice, and make peace betwixt God and ſinners? Anſwer, He entered himſelf in our room, and as Cautioner undertook our debt, ſuffered the condign puniſhmens that was due for our ſins, and payed the price that we ſhould have payed; He in a manner left Heaven and became Man, had a mean life in the World, drank the Cup of his Fathers Wrath, was wounded, bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, chaſtiſed, and died a curſed death, whereof his hanging on the Croſs was but a ſign. 5. What benefites come to us by his ſufferings? Anſwer, Pardon of ſin, Peace with God, and healing; The Conſcience by his blood is ſprinkled from dead works, the perſon abſolved, reconciled to God, made whole, and made at laſt to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; And this is not as <hi>Papiſts</hi> blaſphemouſly ſpeak, a putative effect, but a moſt real one. 6. Who are made partakers of this pardon, peace, and healing? Anſwer, The Elect have right to it, and by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they make the application, therefore it's ſaid here, <hi>our</hi> and <hi>we;</hi> And we may look upon the Prophet ſpeaking in the name of all the Elect, or in name of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Elect, who on believing are actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly healed; The Elect then are healed, and the way how, is by faith making applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt. 7. How in Juſtice can he be condemned that was free of ſin, and how can we be abſolved that were guilty? Anſwer, He in Juſtice was condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as our Cautioner he came in our room, and undertook to pay our debt; And on the ſame ground we wretched ſinners, may in his way make application of his purchaſe; becauſe it was on theſe terms that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the debt, that we might be ſet free; And it's on theſe terms that it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Goſpel, that ſeing he hath payed for elect ſinners, they may upon the hearing of the offer, cloſe with it: But how may the ſinner apply it? Anſwer, Not only becauſe it's free, and freely offered, but by gripping to it by Faith, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doth here; It's not only to apply it ſimply, but to ſtep in and reſt upon it in the terms it is made offer of, ſo that as on the one part Jeſus Chriſt became really lyable to ſuffering, and ſatisfied for our ſins, when he ſaid, <hi>Lo I come, in the volume of thy book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will;</hi> So upon the other part, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſinner comes to apply the price pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by imbracing the price, and acquieſcing in the ſatisfaction, and gripping to it as his own, and by his being brought to ſay in Faith, Let his wounding be my pardon, let his chaſtiſement be my peace, and let his ſtripes be my healing: By this means, as the Law had a right to Chriſt for his paying the Elects debt, ſo they by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing get a right to the promiſe of pardon and healing; For if the bargain was ficker on the one ſide to procure wounding to Chriſt, as if he had been the ſinner himſelf, ſo on the other ſide, the bargain is as ſure; The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is ſet free, and may be as really com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted as if he had a righteouſneſs of his own, or had never had ſinned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Therefore there is here wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful matter of conſolation to Believers, that what was Juſtice to Chriſt, is Grace and Mercy to us, that which was pain to him, is pleaſure to us; His ſorrow our comfort, his wounding our pardon, his ſtripes our healing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. As ye would not prejudge your ſelves of theſe benefites which Chriſt hath purchaſed, make your peace with God through Chriſt; If your pardon and peace be not obtained this way ye will never get it, but ye ſhall be made to pay your own debt, and be lyable to wrath eternally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of inability to pay your debt to the full: Therefore ſtep to, and make the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer welcome, how ſinful and undone ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ye be; The more ſenſible ye be, ye are the more welcome; This is the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular uſe of the Doctrine; O! Let theſe things ſink in your hearts, that ye are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, great ſinners, under wrath, and at feud with God; that Jeſus Chriſt is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of loſt ſinners, and that there is no way to pardon and peace but by cloſing with him, and ſaying hold on his ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;

            <p>IT were no ſmall progreſs in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to know and believe the truths that are implyed and contained in this ſame <hi>verſe;</hi> The Lord by the Prophet is giving a little compend of the work of Redemption by his ſaving of ſinners from death, through, and by the wounding of the Mediator. We did a little open the meaning of the words, and gave a ſum of the Doctrines contained in them, at leaſt of ſome of them which do contribute to this ſcope:</p>
            <p>The Prophet is here ſpeaking of Chriſt's ſufferings, with a reſpect to the cauſe of them, and the effect that followed them, and ſhews how this was indeed the miſtake and blaſphemous imputation that we had of, and were ready to put on him, even to judge him ſmitten and plagued of God for his own ſins, whereas God hath another deſign; He was altogether without ſin, but he was wounded for <hi>our</hi> tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for <hi>our</hi> iniquities; <hi>We</hi> were at feud with God, and he took on him the chaſtiſement of <hi>our</hi> peace; And this is the effect, to procure healing to <hi>us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall now ſpeak a word to three <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> further beſide what we ſpoke to the laſt day, which are theſe, 1. That there was an eternal deſign, plot, and tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt God and the Mediator, as to Chriſts ſuffering for the redeeming of elect ſinners, before he actually ſuffered; This the Prophet ſpeaks of as a thing conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; For the cauſe of his ſufferings was condeſcended on, and the end and fruit of them was determined, which implyes an <hi>antecedamus</hi> tranſaction betwixt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and him for putting him in the room of ſinners; And by this tranſaction Juſtice hath acceſs to exact the payment of this price; He interpoſed, and the Father ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts of him the payment of their debt, and ſeeks ſatisfaction from him for all that he bargained for. 2. That this tranſaction or deſign concerning the Redemption of elect ſinners, is in reſpect of Chriſts ſuffering and ſatisfying of Juſtice, fully and actually performed, he undertook to be wounded and bruiſed, and he was accordingly actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wounded and bruiſed: The tranſaction as to the engagement in it, and efficacy of it, took place in <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s time, and before his time; but as to the actual performance of what the Mediator engaged himſelf to ſuffer, it is ſpoken of prophetically by him as a thing done, becauſe to be done; and now it is done, and indeed long ago. 3. That the ſatisfying of Juſtice by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators Sufferings according to his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, proves as effectual to abſolve, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and heal theſe, even the groſſeſt Sinners, that come under this Bargain and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, as if they had actually ſuffered, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:152256:101"/> payed and ſatisfied their own Debt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; theſe Sins are pardoned through his Sufferings, their deadly Wounds are heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Stripes, as if they had never had a wound; their Compt is daſhed and ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as clean out as if they had never had any Debt; they are acquitted and ſet free as if they had never been guilty.</p>
            <p>Theſe three <hi>Doctrines</hi> ly very near the life of the Goſpel, and the Prophet in this Chapter, and particularly in this Verſe, is often on them. Our purpoſe is only ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to explicate them to you, as a ſhort ſum and compend of the tract of the Covenant of Redemption: The <hi>firſt</hi> of them ſhews the riſe of the work of Redemption. The <hi>ſecond</hi> ſhews the mids by which it is execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>third</hi> holds out the effect and conſequence, and the end of all.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt</hi> then, There is (we ſay) an eternal tranſaction betwixt God and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the Mediator concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Sinners, his actual redeeming by being wounded and bruiſed, ſuppoſeth this; for the Son is no more lyable to ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (not to ſpeak of his ſuitableneſs) then any other of the Perſons of the bleſſed God-head, had there not been an antecedent tranſaction; there was no obligation nor ty on him to be wounded, and to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the room of Sinners as their Cautioner for payment of their Debt, if there had not been a prior engagement; neither could his wounding and bruiſing have proven uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or have brought healing to us, if this prior engagement had not been: And this is it which we call the <hi>Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> which we would not extend ſo, as in all things to ſtretch it to the properties of theſe Covenants and Bargains that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, it being in ſome reſpect an expreſſion uſed to make Grace more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable to us that can conceive ſo little of Graces way: This Tranſaction or Covenant of Redemption is ſometimes called <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will,</hi> and <hi>his law,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do thy will, O my God, yea thy law is within my heart;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 6.38.

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of this Covenant.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Parties, Upon the one ſide as God eſſentially conſidered, or all the three Perſons of the glorious God-head, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, who are all concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in this Covenant, it being the act of the determinate counſel of God; and in this reſpect God is the Party to whom the ſatisfaction for loſt Sinners is made, and he is alſo the Party condeſcending to accept of the ſatisfaction: And upon the other ſide, the Party engaging to make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is Jeſus Chriſt, the ſecond Perſon of the bleſſed, dreadful, and adorable Trinity per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally conſidered, now becoming the head of the Elect, that he may have them all with himſelf to be one m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ical body; in the firſt reſpect, all the three Perſons, that ſame one bleſſed God, give the command or require a ſatisfaction as God, and concur as the infinitely wiſe orderers of the Decree; and in the ſecond reſpect, Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator, undertakes to make the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6, 7. <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not deſire;</hi> God as it were making the offer, what can, or ſhall be given to me for the redemption of Sinners? Sacrifice and Offerings will not pleaſe, nor are accepted by me; then follows the Mediators part, <hi>Lo I come, in the volum of thy book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God;</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:152256:102"/> for though in the firſt reſpect, all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Trinity be on the one ſide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one will, yet in the other reſpect, Chriſt Jeſus as Mediator comes in on the other ſide to do that will.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the matter about which this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is; It's about the ſatisfying of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and making of peace between God and loſt Sinners; it's that we might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, juſtified, have peace with God, and be healed; it is true there is an end above and beyond this, even the glory of Gods rich Grace, and condeſcending love that ſtoups ſo low to ſave Sinners; but Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners pardon, and peace with God, and their healing, is the immediate end: Or if we come nearer; the matter about which it is, is the redeeming of the Elect, for theſe words in the Text, <hi>We</hi> and <hi>Us,</hi> are of equal extent with them that are juſtified and reconciled, and whom he actually heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by his wounds and ſtripes; ſo that whoever they be who are never juſtified and healed, they are not comprehended in this Bargain.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The riſe and occaſion of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant may be gathered from theſe three. 1. There is the ſuppoſing of Mans ſin and fall; for whatever Election doth, Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth moſt certainly ſuppoſe Man to to be loſt and under ſin. 2. There is Gods decree not to pardon ſin without a Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. 3. There is Gods election preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or his purpoſe to ſave ſome for the glory of his Grace, which are the Elect, who are ſaid to be <hi>given to Chriſt:</hi> Theſe three are the riſe an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> occaſion of the Covenant of Redemption; Man hath ſinned, the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning muſt be executed, and Juſtice ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and yet God hath for the glory of his Grace, elected a certain number to Life, and that muſt needs ſtand firm; and theſe three ſeeming to thwart one of them with another, gives the occaſion and riſe to the excellent and admirable contrivance of this way; how the loſt Sinner ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as Juſtice ſhall be ſatisfied and not wronged in the leaſt, and Juſtice ſo ſatisfied, that yet the decree of election by Grace ſhall ſtand.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As for the terms (wherein the form of the Covenant ſtands,) and the midſes by which theſe ends may be brought about; to wit, how the Redemption of loſt Sinners may be attained, Juſtice may be ſatisfied, and the glory of Grace made to ſhine; and how any thing that makes theſe ſeem to juſtle and thwart might be guarded againſt; and that was it which (to ſpeak ſo with reverence) put God to the conſultation about it; which ſhews the excellency of the Covenant of Redemption, and the deep draughts that are about it, for otherways and properly God needs not conſult or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: They are ſhortly theſe, 1. Gods of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to redeem Man if his Juſtice may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and if any reſponſal Perſon will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Cautioner and undertake to pay the Elects Debt. 2. The Sons accepting of the Offer, and undertaking or engaging to pay their Debt, upon condition that his pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſatisfaction ſhall be accounted the Elects, and accepted for them. 3. The Fathers acceptation of this engagement, and undertaking according to his offer; and the Mediators accepting of it, and acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in it, he holds the Bargain (to ſpeak ſo,) and ſo it is a cloſed Covenant: The firſt is comprehended in theſe words, <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and offering thou didſt not deſire,</hi> Pſal. 40. inſinuating that God did deſire ſomething; The ſecond in theſe words, <hi>Mine ears thou haſt opened, then ſaid I, Lo I come in the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum of thy book, it's written of me, I delight to do thy will;</hi> which implys the Fathers acceptation as well as Chriſts undertaking; and it alſo points at the way how the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is made effectual; eſpecially if we compare theſe words of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, 6. we will find that they relate to Chriſts Humiliation in general, for it is in the <hi>Pſalm, Mine ears haſt thou opened;</hi> but in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. it is, <hi>A body haſt thou prepared me;</hi> and where it is ſaid in the <hi>Pſalm, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do thy will,</hi> the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>By the which will, we are ſanctified:</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes the offer on the terms of a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Juſtice, the Son as Mediator ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the offer, and undertakes for the Elect, here am I to do thy will on the ſame
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:152256:102"/> terms that the offer is made; and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accepts of the Sons engagement, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well-pleaſed;</hi> he offers himſelf Surety for Sinners, and the Father is content to accept of him as their Surety: In the one reſpect it's called the <hi>Fathers pleaſure, Verſ.</hi> 10. of this Chapter, <hi>yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him,</hi> &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the terms were ſo propoſed; and in the other reſpect it's called the <hi>Mediators pleaſure,</hi> or <hi>ſatisfaction, Verſ.</hi> 11. becauſe the condition propoſed is ſatisfying to him, <hi>The pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand;</hi> He undertakes to pay, and God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of his undertaking, and obliges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to abſolve the Believer; and the words following, <hi>He ſhall ſee his ſeed, and of the travel of his ſoul and be ſatisfied, and by his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many,</hi> are Promiſes made to him on ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his making ſatisfaction: And in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> the firſt part of the Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, <hi>He hath made him to be ſin for us that knew no ſin;</hi> and the other part of it is, <hi>That we might be made the righteouſneſs of God through him;</hi> he accepting of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, obtains a right to a juſtifying and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving Sentence by vertue of his ſuffering, for which cauſe theſe words are added <hi>in him,</hi> or <hi>through him;</hi> This ſhews the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Gods Juſtice in proceeding with the Mediator; the ground of Sinners Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through him, and gives Sinners a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to make uſe of Chriſts ſatisfaction as theirs, becauſe it was ſo agreed upon in the counſel of the God-head.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We come now to ſpeak a little to ſome properties of this Covenant, and ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves with three or four of them that make for the ſcope, As 1. The juſtice and equity of it. 2. The faithfulneſs of it. 3. The freeneſs of it. And 4. The wiſdom that ſhines in this Bargain; paſſing by the reſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The juſtice and equity</hi> of this Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may appear in theſe reſpects, 1. That the Father ſhould be ſatisfied, that he that was wronged ſhould have his honour reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the threatning given out in his Law ſhould light and take effect; that the Soul that ſins, ſhould in his own, or in the Sureties perſon, die; and that a ſuitable recompence ſhould be made to Juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sinner be abſolved. 2. Juſtice appears in this reſpect, That when the Son of God, the Mediator, offers to become Man, and to endure and ſuffer all that the Elect ſhould have ſuffered, his ſufferings ſhould be accepted as a ſatisfaction; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the juſtice of God, yea, the holineſs, power, and greatneſs of God, are as glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly manifeſted in Chriſts ſatisfaction, as if Man had ſuffered; nay, there would not have been ſuch an amends and ſatisfaction made to Juſtice, if all Creatures had ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Juſtice by this means hath more ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction than it could have had otherways; and hereby the holineſs of God, and the ſeverity of his juſtice, as well as the conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending love of God, is the more manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he himſelf ſhould condeſcend to ſatisfie; therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. it's ſaid, <hi>That he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that believeth on Jeſus:</hi> God is juſt, in that he will not only have ſatisfaction, but an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent ſatisfaction for the reſtoring of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to its declarative glory wherein it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by Mans fall. 3. Juſtice appears in this reſpect, That the Mediator ſatisfying Juſtice, theſe for whom he ſuffered ſhould be acquitted, and have the ſentence of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution paſt in their favours: which the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we would take noti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of, that we may know the redemption purchaſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed by the Mediator, is by an exact ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of Juſtice, and not by removing of our ſins as he did remove diſeaſes, nor by pardoning of them by an authority commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him; but, as I ſaid, by a real and actual ſatisfying of the Juſtice of God for them; therefore <hi>Luke</hi> 24. it's ſaid, <hi>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to ſuffer theſe things, and then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his glory;</hi> there was a neceſſity of it, becauſe of the juſtice of this Covenant, for the Son, not only to become Man, and be in a low condition, but to become a Curſe and to die the curſed death of the Croſs.</p>
            <p>A ſecond property is <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> on all ſides; Faithfulneſs on the Fathers ſide in his Word and Promiſe to the Son, <hi>All that are given of the father are made to come to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:152256:103" rendition="simple:additions"/> him, and there is nothing loſt, John</hi> 6.37, 44, 45. Faithfulneſs on the Sons ſide, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming all according to his undertaking, <hi>fulfilling all righteouſneſs:</hi> Therefore when in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> word he ſayes, <hi>Deliver me from this hour,</hi> in the next word he ſayes, <hi>But for this cauſe came I unto this hour;</hi> It was my errand into the World, and now I am to go about it by and by, <hi>And I lay down my life for my ſheep of my ſelf, no man taketh my life from me but I have power to lay it down, and power to take it up again;</hi> His faithfulneſs alſo appears in keeping all that are committed to his truſt, <hi>None of them ſhall periſh, but he ſhall raiſe them up at the last day;</hi> Therefore he is called the <hi>good</hi> or faithful <hi>ſhepherd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It's a <hi>free</hi> Covenant, it's <hi>just,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and the Mediator, but as to the Elect, it's moſt <hi>free;</hi> By his wounds we have pardon, and by his ſtripes we have healing; <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was on him;</hi> There is not one grain weight or worth to be ſatisfied by us; <hi>He was made ſin for us,</hi> he was made the curſe, even the wrath-pacifying-ſacrifice and offering; <hi>That we might be made the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> not through ought in our ſelves, but <hi>through him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It's a moſt <hi>wiſe</hi> contrivance, for if the Son had not become Man and Mediator, how could Juſtice have been ſatisfied, or the Elect pardoned and healed? They could not ſatisfie for themſelves, and no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could ſatisfie for them, therefore the only wiſe God finds out a wiſe mids for ſuch an end, as is the ſaving of the Elect, in a way wherein Juſtice and Mercy, or free Grace, ſweetly kiſs each other, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they both ſhine forth conſpicuouſly and radiantly.</p>
            <p>That which we would ſay in ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Covenant, is this; that Jeſus Chriſt hath undertaken to pay the Elect's debt, and hath ſtepped in into their room, And God hath imputed unto him their ſin, and accepted of a ſatisfaction from him for them; And all this in a legal and juſt way; ſo as there is acceſs before the Throne of God for them to plead for the application of his Righteouſneſs by vertue of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; That as really and faithfully as Chriſt performed his u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The 2. <hi>Doctrine</hi> is, That this tranſaction and deſign concerning the Redemption of ſinners, is now not only undertaken, but fully performed, as is clear, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. <hi>Him being delivered by the determinat counſel of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain;</hi> The eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe concerning this is now execute: As to the efficacy of his ſufferings, <hi>He is</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world;</hi> Becauſe neither the Son's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking was queſtioned by the Father, nor the Fathers promiſe queſtioned by the Son; To ſpeak ſo with reverence of ſuch a myſtery, the Father before his coming truſts him upon his engagement with the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo many Elect Souls as he had given him; And the Son conſidered as Mediator, truſts the Father with the juſtifying of them, according to the promiſe made to him in the 11.

               </gap>f God themſelves: This is the very end of this tranſaction. <hi>He was wounded, for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of our peace was upon him, and by his ſtripes we are healed;</hi> His wounds, bruiſes and ſtripes effectually procured Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and healing to us; And this is the ground of that which we call <hi>imputed righteouſneſs,</hi> and ſhews how it comes to paſs that we are made righteous by the righteouſneſs of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, ſcornfully called <hi>putative righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> by <hi>Papiſts:</hi> But conſidering what is in the former Doctrines, and in this; we will find it to be a clear truth, on which our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and the whole weight of our Salvation hangs; That the believing ſinner cloſing with Chriſts ſatisfaction is as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually abſolved from ſin as if he had never ſinned; Chriſt's ſatisfaction becomes as really his as if he had payed the debt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; And if we conſider theſe three, 1. The great deſign of the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption betwixt God and the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>diator. 2. The faithfulneſs of God in this Covenant, in performing his part on the terms on which the Mediator laid down a price for the Elect. 3. The excellency and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the price payed with reſpect to the Covenant; We will find that there is clear acceſs in Law, or according to the Decree of God manifeſted (the Decree is called a <hi>Law, Thy Law is within my heart</hi>) for the groſſeſt ſinners that come under this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and cloſe with this Covenant, their obtaining Peace, Pardon, Juſtification, and Healing, as if they had never ſinned, or had ſatisfied themſelves, and that they may confidently expect it on this ground.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:152256:104"/>1. I ſay, if we conſider the great end and deſign of the Covenant betwixt God and the Mediator, we will find it to be the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of the Elect: Chriſt ſuffered not for any ſin that was inherently in himſelf; He had no ſin, there was no guile found in his mouth; no quarrel betwixt God and him on his own account, but he was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>our</hi> tranſgreſſions, The chaſtiſement of <hi>our</hi> peace was on him; to make peace betwixt God and us by his wounding, was the great deſign of the Covenant of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; And can that deſign hold if his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction come not in the room of ours, and ſtand not for our ſatisfaction and payment? In man's Law the Cautioner paying the debt proves valid for the Principal Debtor, &amp; when this is the deſign of God in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption how to get the debt of Dyvour Sinners payed, and themſelves ſet at liberty, and when this is found out as the mids, <hi>A body haſt thou prepared unto me;</hi> the Covenant muſt be as real on the one ſide as it is on the other; That is, as real and effectual to make the Believer in Chriſt juſt, as it was real and effectual to make Chriſt to be accounted the ſinner, and to be dealt with as ſuch. We may clear it further in theſe two, 1. By looking to Chriſt typifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the offerings under the Law; When the ſinner came with his offering he laid his hand on the head of the Beaſt, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the <hi>Scape-goat,</hi> to ſhew that Jeſus Chriſt who was to come to be both Prieſt and Sacrifice, was ſo to bear the ſins of the Elect, as that they were to be ſet free; That he was to lay his neck down to the Knife of Juſtice that the ſtroak might be kept off our Throat. 2. We are ſo juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Chriſt as Chriſt was made ſin for us, now our ſins became really Chriſts, not that he was made the ſinner inherent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that were blaſphemous to be thought or ſpoken of; But he was reckoned the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and was ſubſtitute in the room of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as if he had been the ſinner, and was made to ſatisfie for Original ſin, and for Actual ſin; as if he had been guilty of them by committing them: Therefore 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> He is ſaid to be <hi>made ſin for us,</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. To be made <hi>a curſe for us,</hi> and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>To bear our ſins in his own body on the tree;</hi> And if he ſuffered for us, and if we partake of his righteouſneſs as he did of our ſins; then our Juſtification re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally follows, and we are abſolved and made righteous through his ſatisfaction cloſed with by Faith as if we had never ſinned: The parallel is clear, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> He was made ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him; So that as Chriſt was made ſin, in the ſame manner we are made righteous; That as legally as he who had no debt, was made lyable to our debt, ſo as legally we partake of his righteouſneſs, and are declared free; even as the Dyvour is legally fred from the debt which his Cautioner hath payed, and cannot be lyable to it; So the Believer by Chriſts ſatisfaction is freed from the debt of ſin, and abſolved and declared righteous: And though this may ſeem ſtrange and a wonder, to be a ſinner, and yet in ſome reſpect free of ſin, under guilt and yet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; yet Chriſts ſatisfaction is as real and effectual as to the Believer, as if he had ſatisfied himſelf, becauſe his Cautioner hath ſatisfied for him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we conſider Gods faithfulneſs in this Covenant in performing his part, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the terms of it, the matter is clear; For as the Mediator hath perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his part according to his engagement; ſo it is impoſſible but God muſt perform his, and muſt accept of the ſatisfaction in name of the Elect, and upon their believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtifie them; For as it was the Fathers will that he ſhould lay down his life for his ſheep, ſo it was the will of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, that Believers in him ſhould through his ſatisfaction have eternal life, <hi>John</hi> 6.39, 40. When he hath ſaid before, <hi>I came not to do my own will but the will of him that ſent me,</hi> he ſubjoyns, <hi>This is the Fathers will which ſent me, that of all that he hath given me I ſhould loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day;</hi> Where the ſatisfaction that Chriſt ſhould make is implyed, and it is a great one, And what ſatisfaction ſhall he have for that? Even the ſalvation of the Elect, <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:152256:104"/> one that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him may have everlasting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day;</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. of this Chapter, it's clear that he ſhall not want ſatisfaction, for <hi>he ſhall ſee the travel of his ſoul and be ſatisfied;</hi> And what is the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction? <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervant juſtifie many;</hi> he ſhall be the cauſe of the juſtifying of many, and they ſhall be actually abſolved in due time; And what is the ground of it? <hi>For he ſhall bear their iniquities:</hi> And therefore as God is faithful he ſhall get that which he merited and purchaſed for them, applyed unto them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we conſider the excellent and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent price that Jeſus Criſt hath payed, and that with reſpect to the Covenant, we have a clear ground why the Believer may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and be confident to be abſolved and declared free; It is no mean price, Gold, Silver, or precious Stones, but the Blood of him that was and is God; which we ſay would be conſidered not ſimply, but with reſpect to the Covenant, and to the end wherefore he ſuffered and ſhed his Blood; For though it be no comfort to a ſinner ſimply that Chriſt ſuffered, yet when he conſiders that it was for this end, to wit, that Juſtice might be ſatisfied, and that theſe for whom he ſatisfied might be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſet free, The believing ſinner may hence reaſon, If there was a reality in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice purſuing of him as my Cautioner, and a reality and efficacy in his ſatisfaction, and if it was full and compleat, ſo as Juſtice was fully ſatisfied by it; then there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of Mercy, Pardon, Juſtification, and Peace with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>od, and of heallng to and for me, their being made forth coming to me upon the condition of believing; And in this reſpect, though it be grace to pardon ſin as to us, yet it is Juſtice in God to give Chriſt the ſatisfaction for the travel of his Soul, as well as he gave God ſatisfaction to his Juſtice; And the equivalent of that which the Elect ſhould have payed, being payed to Juſtice by Chriſt their Cautioner, the Lord cannot, nor will not ſhun nor ſhift the pardoning of a believing ſinner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> are five, 1. Of Inſtruction, whereby we may have a little Map of Gods way of ſaving ſinners, and of the way of ſinners coming to get Salvation through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſtir us up to admire the love of God contriving ſuch a deſign for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of loſt ſinners; at the love of God that gave his Son; and at the love of the Son that engaged to come, and hath come and payed our debt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It gives a notable warrand to the faith of a ſinner to take hold of, and cloſe with Chriſt; and to reſt upon his ſatisfaction for his Juſtification and healing; becauſe he hath God and the Mediator Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this very end; the Mediator en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging to ſatisfie, and God engaging to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſatisfaction, and to juſtifie all theſe who ſhall accept of it, and reſt upon it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Its therefore a notable ground of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and of exhortation to take hold of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his ſatisfaction; Folk would not skar at him, but lippen their Salvation to him; and be ſure the bargain will not fail; As it is ſure that the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor hath ſatisfied, it is as ſure that his ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſhall be made forth-coming to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To reprove the neglecters and ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Jeſus Chriſt, and of this offered Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through him; when he hath taken the threatning and curſe of the Law on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to make out the Promiſe to them, it muſt be a great aggravation of folks guilt to ſlight him. It ſerves alſo to comfort a poor ſinner that hath may ſins and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, and knows not how to be quit of them; The Covenant ſayes our ſins are tranſlated on the Mediator, that we might be ſet free; Chriſt Jeſus Covenanted on the terms of Juſtice to make way for us to Covenant on the terms of Mercy; God Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted with him to purſue our ſin in him, and he Covenanted to impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yea we may from this know, what is that moſt horrible, dreadful, and confounding Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which is abiding all of you that ſtand it out, and do not make your Peace with God through this Satisfaction of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord Jeſus, When ye ſhall be made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally to bear the wrath that Sin deſerves, which yet is intollerable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Ye would hence know, and ſtudy to be clear and diſtinct in your knowledge of this precious Truth, how a Sinner that by nature is under Sin and Wrath, and hath ground every day to look for it, may be freed from that Curſe and Wrath? To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which, the Lord hath made a Covenant with the Son who is appointed Mediator for making Peace betwixt God and Sinners by ſatisfying his Juſtice for them, and by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Debt that was due by them, ſo that this Wrath is prevented, and their Peace is made by vertue of this Covenant of Redemption; wherein theſe two clauſes are agreed and concluded upon betwixt theſe two infinitely reſponſal Parties 1. That Chriſt ſhall become the Sinner, and be handled as a Sinner, though there was no ſin in him. 2. That the Elect Sinner that by nature was a child of wrath even as well as others, ſhall be fred from the Wrath to come by vertue of his Satisf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction: Theſe are two Pillars that our Salvation is built upon, and that our Peace and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God flow from; By his wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bruiſing we are pardoned, <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was on him, and by his ſtripes we are healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To clear this a little; This Covenant would be conſidered, 1. As it looks to the parties and their ſeveral actions. 2. As it lookes to the Execution thereof in all the ſteps of it.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, There are three parties that concur in their own place, 1. God is the Party offended, and he is here bruiſing and wounding the Mediator: He is the Judge, and ſtands ready to execute the Sentence that ſtands in his Law againſt Sinners if he get not an equival<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt Satisfaction. 2. Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator is the Party wounded and bruiſed: the Mediator's part is to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſtice, to pay the Price and perform the Satisfaction reſolved upon in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, of ſuitable and ſufficient value for the Redemption of the Elect, according
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:152256:106"/> to his Engagement; and he is actually wounded and bruiſed: God determined what ſhall ſatisfie, Chriſt Jeſus accepts of the Determination, engages to ſatisfie, and does actually ſatisfie for elect Sinners. A 3d. Party is, We poor Sinners, He was wounded for <hi>our</hi> Tranſgreſſions <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's the elect Sinner, or the Sinner, who being made in due time ſenſible of Sin, and affraid of Wrath, and who being kindly touched with the Apprehenſion of it, and cleared anent the firmneſs and freeneſs of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and anent the fulneſs of Chriſt's Satisfaction, doth by Faith flee unto Jeſus Chriſt and ſubmit to his Satisfaction, and betakes himſelf allenatly to that for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; Chriſt layes down the Price, and the beleeving Sinner pleads for Intereſt in it, and for the Benefit of it, and by Faith gets Title and Right to an Abſolvitor from his Debt and Guilt: If it then be asked what is the thing whereby a Sinner is pardoned and juſtified, reconcealed to God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from Wrath and healed? I anſwer, It is by Believing in Jeſus Chriſt: If it be again asked, What is the ground or reaſon why the believing Sinner obtains that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? I anſwer, Becauſe our Lord Jeſus hath ſufficiently ſatisfied for, and fully pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the debt of, ſo many as are brought to believe on him: If it be 3dly asked, How comes it that Chriſts Satisfaction becomes a Ranſom, and is accepted for ſuch and ſuch a Believer? I anſwer, It is by vertue of the Eternal Covenant of Redemption, or Tranſaction made betwixt the Father and the Son; wherein it was agreed that his ſuffering and ſatisfieing of Juſtice, ſhould be accepted for believing Sinners, as if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had ſatisfied; according to that of <hi>Job.</hi> 6.39, 40. <hi>This is the fathers will that ſent me, that of all that he have given me I ſhould loſe nothing; and this is the will of him that ſent me, that whoſoever ſeeth the Son and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life:</hi> So our believing is the firſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at ſtep whereby we came to obtain pardon of Sin and Peace with God; Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs or Satisfaction, is that whereon our believing ſounds it ſelf; yet ſo as it hath a reſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct to the eternal Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, whence both Chriſt's Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and our Believing do flow, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we could have no Warrand to expect Righteouſneſs through a Mediator; for unleſs we know that Chriſt hath ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Juſtice for Elect ſinners that ſhall believe on him, we cannot reſt on him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; And unleſs we have an eye to the Covenant of Redemption, we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that this ſatisfaction will be accepted for us: And therefore if we will trace theſe ſteps back again, the firſt riſe of our Salvation is in the counſel of God; the proſecution of it is in Chriſts ſatisfaction; And the application of his ſatisfaction, is by our fleeing to it, and accepting of it by Faith: And therefore we would learn in our looking and ſtepping up to Heaven, to look to theſe three in this order, we would firſt begin at Faith, and in believing we would conſider Chriſts ſatisfaction, and from that we would aſcend to the riſe of it, to wit, the Covenant of Redemption, and the terms of it; All which put together, give a very clear ground of expecting righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs through Jeſus Chriſt: I ſhall illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat it by a Scripture-ſimilitude, wherein I ſhall ſhew you how all the three concur, yet ſo as there is a difference in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence; Ye know that under the Law there were <hi>Cities of refuge</hi> appointed, which were Types of Jeſus Chriſt, in whom we find a ſhelter; In theſe Cities of refuge, conſider theſe three that concurred for ſaving the perſon that had committed man-ſlaughter: 1. God's determination appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a thing, and that the Man-ſlayer being within ſuch a City, ſhould be ſafe from the avenger of blood, and this gave the riſe to the other two that follow. 2. The City it ſelf as a ſhelter or refuge to the Man-ſlayer. 3. The perſons fleeing or running to hide themſelves in it: Now the ſafety of the perſon of the Man-ſlayer did flow from all the three. 1. The Law, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing ſuch a City, was the ground. 2. The City was the ſhelter. 3. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons actual running to the City, gave him a claim and title to the priviledge of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; For though the former two had been, if he had not fled to the City he had not
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:152256:106"/> obtained the benefit of ſafety: Even ſo, the Believer that would be ſaved, is to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe <hi>three,</hi> 1. Gods determining ſuch a way of Salvation to Elect Sinners by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. 2. The Mediator priviledged as the City of Refuge for this end. And 3. The ſinners fleeing to him, which is his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him, and his ſeeking and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the benefit of Chriſt's ſatisfaction according to the terms of the Covenant: Now ſuppoſe a perſon to flee to the City of Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uge, he is preſerved in it, Juſtice cannot follow him further then the Gates, yet ſo, as he hath the benefit by Gods determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and appointment of the City for ſuch an end, and yet ſo as he muſt flee into it ere he can plead for the benefit of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: So, ſuppoſe a ſinner to be fled to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſt Chriſt by Faith, he may plead for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from wrath, by God's determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and appointing a Mediator for ſuch an end; And the Mediator Jeſus Chriſt hath this priviledge conferr'd on him, that he that thus flees unto him ſhall be ſafe; Yet it is alſo ſuppos'd that ſuch a ſinner hath fled to him, elſe he could not expect ſafety through him, notwithſtanding of Gods determining the Mediator for ſafety: Thus we would have theſe three put together; And yet (as we ſaid) they differ; for Gods determination is the efficient cauſe &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all; Chriſts ſatisfaction is the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orious cauſe, and our believing is the ground on which we have right to plead for the benefit of his ſatisfaction; Even as the man that fled to the City of Refuge, his ſafety was not by any vertue in his running, but by God's determination, yet his run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the City was requiſite as the mids, and except he run or fled to it, he could not plead for the benefit of the City; So our believing gives us ground to plead a right and title to Chriſt and his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without which we could not have that right.</p>
            <p>But 2dly, Becauſe one will take up this under one notion, and another under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; To clear it therefore a little further, we ſhall again conſider in this Covenant theſe three ſteps, 1. The determination of it, as it is enacted in the Council of the God-head, which in ſum is this, that ſuch and ſuch perſons ſhall be ſatisfied for by the Mediator, and his ſatisfaction accepted for them. 2. The execution of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, where we take in all our Lords ſufferings; all the ſtroaks and wounds that Juſtice purſued him with, as Cautioner for the Elect; and God's accepting and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of him, and declaring his accepting of him, and being well ſatisfied with what he did and ſuffered by his raiſing him from dead. 3. The application of his purchaſe by his accepted ſatisfaction; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in theſe, 1. That theſe that were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Chriſt on this condition that his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction ſhould ſtand good for them, ſhould be juſtified and ſaved, that is, that in due time application of his ſatisfaction ſhould be made to the perſons given him to to be ſaved by him; Which takes in Chriſt's making interceſſion, that Renewing-grace, Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be given to ſuch perſons. 2. That the work of the Spirit, who, as the Sanctifier, begets Faith, and perſwads to imbrace Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be given them- Then 3. follows the Believers actual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, being ſweetly and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully drawn to reſt on him and his ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; Whereupon follows the application of the ſentence of Juſtification and Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that reſults from the former; So that whereas it was before, <hi>Curſed is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues not in all things written in the Law;</hi> Now it is, <hi>He that believeth on Jeſus Chriſt hath eternal life, and ſhall never come into condemnation;</hi> All theſe go and agree well together, the Covenant as the ground, Chriſt's ſatisfaction as the meritorious cauſe, and the application of his ſatisfaction by Faith, which entitles and gives the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever a right to it.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why we have ſo much inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this, is, that we may teach you to joyn reſpect to the Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Chriſt's ſuffering, and your believing together; It will not be Faith that will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, that is without reſpect to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; Neither will the Covenant and Chriſt's ſatisfaction juſtifie without Faith; yet ye would ſo put them together, as the glory of Salvation through Grace may not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:152256:107"/> lye on Faith, but on God's everlaſting Love, and on Chriſt's ſatisfaction: And indeed it is no little practick for a Soul ſenſible of ſin, in the exerciſe of Faith, ſo to lay the weight of its Salvation on Chriſt and the Covenant, as it neglects not running to Chriſt by Fait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and ſo to lay hold on Chriſt by Faith, as it lay not the weight on Faith, but on Chriſt and the Covenant: As in the compariſon before uſed, ſuppoſe a man that had killed another unawares, had been taken before he wan to the City of Refuge, God's deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination was not the cauſe of that, but his not running, or his not coming at the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; So it may be that ſome are apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Juſtice of God, that are leſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than others; yet the reaſon or c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e is not in God's Covenant, nor in C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riſts want of worth, but in the perſons not running, or not fleeing to Chriſt, as to the City of Refuge; and therefore they are not heard to plead for immunity by vertue of that ſatisfaction before the Bar of God.</p>
            <p>A 2d. ſort of <hi>Uſes</hi> are for exhorting and encouraging Sinners to come to Chriſt; There is here then 1. A clear ground to our our Faith, and a plain way opened to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and a mighty encouragement to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Sinners to lay hold on Chriſt, and to take this way for obtaining of life; This Text opens as it were the gates of the City of Refuge, and points out the way how to eſhew the wrath which is to come: There is a way here laid down in the Wiſdom, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Go dneſs and Grace of God, which is made offer of in the Goſpel; and ſince it is ſo, we beſeech you that ye would not receive this Grace in vain, but ſeing there is a Covenant well ordered and ſure, a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and a Ranſom provided, and a way laid down how to come to Chriſt by Faith, let all of you who come under the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin and apprehenſion of Wrath, ſtep to and cloſe with him, and plead for Pardon by vertue of his Wounds, and for healing through his Stripes with reſpect to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>There are theſe <hi>four</hi> things here that will ſerve to give ground for this Application, if we conſider 1. The great ground of Faith that is here. 2. The great reaſon we have to make uſe of this ground. 3. The great encouragement we have ſo to do. And 4ly. The great neceſſity we have to make this Application; A little to each of theſe; But we ſhall premit one word to all, and it's this, That conſidering you are all in tryft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terms with God, whether ye live at a diſtance from him, the U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e will by way of Exhortation reach you; or whether ye be brought to greater nearneſs under the ſenſe of Sin, and have ſome ſeriouſneſs in ſeeking after God, it will reach you for Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; In a word, we would exhort all and it may convince ſome, &amp; comfort others: But to the firſt thing we propoſed, We declare and proclaim this as a true and faithful ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there is here an Everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, wherein the ſalvation of the Elect is concluded through Chriſts ſatisfaction to Juſtice for them, and a way laid down for making Peace betwixt God and all them that will thorowly renounce their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on and Healing to them: And for your confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation conſider in general, if it be poſſible that this Covenant of Redemption, the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Mediator, and the Promiſes made to Believing, can be for nought; did the Father purſue the Cautioner ſo hotly for nothing? or did the Cautioner pay ſuch a Ranſom for nothing? no certainly, if it had not been to communicate Pardon and Peace, with Healing by his Wounds an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fore for grounds of your Faith more particularly, ſee here 1. A full Satisfaction, God hath made way to Sinners Peace with himſelf, by ſatisfying himſelf fully in Chriſt the Mediator for the ſins of elect Believers, ſo that a ſinner that in the ſenſe of ſin betakes himſelf to him, needs not to fear any back-accompts, becauſe what ever might make for our Peace, was fully ſaid on him, ſo that we may with holy and humble boldneſs ſay, that <hi>we are not come to the mount that might not be touched nor to blackneſs and darkneſs &amp; tempeſt, and the ſound of a trumpet; but we are come unto mount Sion, the city of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, the heavenly Jeruſalem, and to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:152256:107"/> the Mediator of the new Covenant, and to the blood of ſprinkling:</hi> Our invitation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to you, is not to bid you come and compt for your own Debt your ſelves, but to come and accept of Chriſts payment of it, and of his Satisfaction, whereby Juſtice is compleatly ſatisfied. 2. See here as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground of Faith, the Juſtice of God, not with reſpect to us, but to the Bargain betwixt the Father and the Son who are the principal Parties, and we (to ſpeak ſo) but Parties accidentally in this Covenant; the Covenant being primarly and mainly betwixt God and the Mediator; the Juſtice of it appears in this, that it hath reſpect to a Covenant which is fulfilled on all ſides, and therefore the Elects believing and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of the Mediators Satisfaction, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be accepted as if he had payed the the Debt himſelf; the Father (to ſpeak ſo) had the carving of the Bargain and what ſatisfaction his Juſtice was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, to his own mind; and as it was Juſtice on the Sons ſide to ſatisfie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his undertaking, ſo it's Juſtice on the Fathers ſide to pardon and be at peace with the Sinner that by Faith flies unto Jeſus Chriſt. 3. See in this Bargain not only Juſtice, but Mercy; as its juſt, ſo its a graciouſly free Bargain; which is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and may ſeem ſomewhat ſtrange if not paradoxal, yet its nothing inconſiſtent with the way of Grace; it's juſt that the Cautioner ſhould pay the Debt; and yet that Debt is moſt freely and frankly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned as to us; it's Juſtice in the height as to the Mediator, but free Grace as to us in the height; we come to it freely and without price though it coſt him dear: And that is one of the Mediators Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings that it ſhould be free to his Seed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that he who ſeeth the Son and believeth on him ſhould have eternal life.</hi> 4. Conſider the reality and ſureneſs of the Bargain, it is ſuch as it cannot fail, having ſuch Pillars to lean on, the Faithfulneſs of God engaged on juſt and equal terms and the glory of God as the end; and having a moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtain effect, to wit, Healing to all to whom this ſoveraign Medicine is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: This ſtability and ſureneſs of the Covenant flows from Gods engaging to the Mediator, and the Mediators engaging to God; from the Mediators ſatisfying and the Fathers accepting of his Satisfaction, which being confirmed by the Blood of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, it becomes a <hi>Teſtament</hi> which cannot be annulled nor altered or changed. And if all this be ſo, let me put the queſtion, is there not good ground here to exhort the Hearers of the Goſpel to believe in Chriſt, and on Believing, to look for Life through him? and a moſt ſolid ground laid down whereupon to build the hopes of Eternal Life? and therefore ſeing this is the up-ſhot of all, that Life is to be gotten freely by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, improve this way of Salvation for making your Peace under no leſs certification than this, even as ye would eſhew reckoning with Divine Juſtice in your own Perſons for the leaſt Farthing of your Debt.</p>
            <p>If it be <hi>objected</hi> here by any, 1. We are at enmity with God and cannot ſatisfie, I <hi>anſwer,</hi> This Text tells you that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not ſought from you, but from the Mediator who hath already given it, and the Father hath accepted it for all ſuch as ſhall by Faith plead the benefit of it. 2. If ye ſhall ſay, we know not how to win at God, we are ſuch as cannot ſtep on foot forward, and ſo very ſinful and miſerable that we know no ſuch Tranſgreſſors and Wretches. I <hi>anſwer,</hi> Was it not for ſuch that the Mediator tranſacted, even for ſuch as we Tranſgreſſors, Rebels, Deſpiſers of him, and ſuch as judged him to be ſmitten and plagued of God? If he had been Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only for righteous Folks, there had been ſome reaſon for ſuch an objection, but it is for Sinners, for moſt hainous Sinners: Nay, this way of reaſoning and pleading ſays on the matter, that Chriſt needed not have laid down his life. 3. If it be ſaid, We are ſo ſinful and backſliding, ſo filthy and pollu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed that we think we are not within the reach of healing: I <hi>anſwer,</hi> This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning would if it held, turn in effect to this, that ye are not within the reach of Gods Grace and for Chriſts Satisfaction; which is not only injurious but even blaſphemous to the Grace of God and to the Satisfaction

               </gap>t City of Refuge was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or built for me, and when the Gates of it were caſt open ſhould ſkar to enter in it on this account? when it was told him that it was appointed for ſuch: Juſt ſo is it here: And ſuppoſe one ſhould ſay, I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, it is as if ſuch a man ſhould ſay, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, I dow not run to the City; nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther though he had been feeble, yet he would have creeped, clinſhed and cripled to it as he might: Even ſo here, in a word, a man ſhould not diſpute whoſe name is in the Covenant, but ſhould ſtep forward to the Shelter and Refuge; as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18.19. where the Apoſtle borroweth the ſame ſimilitude, and ſays, <hi>God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed his promiſe by an oath, that by two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable things in which it was impoſſible for God to lie, that we might have ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope ſet before us:</hi> Men in their Natural condition are compared to the Man-ſlayer, lying under the ſtroak of the Law, or under the hazard of being purſued by the Avenger of Blood; Chriſt is compared to the City of Refuge; and the heir of Promiſe being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, what ſhall he do? will his election ſimply ſave him? no, but he muſt flee unto Jeſus Chriſt as to his City of Refuge: And therefore, by all means run and flee to him, as having this fear, leaſt the Avenger of Blood purſue and overtake you; and if ye cannot run ſo faſt as ye would, yet run as ye may; and ye have this advantage that the City of Refuge is not far off, it's near you even at your Door, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>Rom:</hi> 10. <hi>The word is near thee, in thy mouth and in thine heart;</hi> the cripleſt Body among you all has Chriſt at your door that ye may enter into him as into a City of Refuge, and that he may come in and ſup with you; ſo that though ye cannot lift your feet ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in running to him, if ye can but in good earneſt roll your ſelves over upon him, ye ſhall be ſafe: Seing then that this way of Salvation is ſo full, ſo free, ſo equal and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, take heed leaſt ye prejudge your ſelves of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. To preſs this yet a little further, Conſider what good reaſon ye have to run; Take but this one word, Ye are Sinners lying under the Curſe and Wrath of God, and have ye any other way of obtaining Pardon or of making your Peace? and if ye believe that ye are Sinners and under the Curſe, is there not need that ye ſhould run to a Shelter from it? If we were preaching to Angels that had never ſinned, there might be ſome reaſon for their ſlighting or laying little weight upon ſuch a word of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſeing ye are Sinners, and lyable to Gods Curſe, why do ye ſlight a Saviour, having ſo much need of him?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:152256:108"/>3dly, Conſider yet further, that ye have encouragement to run, and nothing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you; What prejudice is in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? There is no prejudice at all in this way, but many advantages; Doubtleſs Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will not fail them that believe: Yea, we may add from the words of the Text, for encouraging to this that the man or woman that is ſenſible of ſin, and afraid of wrath, hath the Covenant to look to, for begetting and throughing the work of Faith in them with power; for if it be true that all the midſes are in the Covenant, as well as the end; and if we may lay weight on the Covenant for the effect, to wit, the pardon of ſin, and healing, then we may alſo lay hold on the Covenant for further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to that effect: I ſpeak not this as if folk could of themſelves act Faith on the Covenant, before Faith be given them; But I ſpeak it to encourage young begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that think they have no Faith at all, that they may act what they have, and may look more and more to the Covenant, to be inlightened, quickened, and ſtrengthened, and that they may ſay with the poor man in the Goſpel, <hi>Lord, I believe, help my unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;</hi> And with the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1 <hi>Draw me;</hi> and <hi>We will run after thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And finally, for preſſing of this, conſider the abſolute neceſſity that ye are under of making uſe of this way of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of getting your peace made by Chriſts ſatisfaction, and your wounds healed by his ſtripes; There is no mids, but either ye muſt hazard on a reckoning with God on your own ſcore, or accept of his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: There was never a Covenant made by God with Man but two, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works for perfectly righteous folks, by which Covenant no ſinner was ever able to come to life; And a Covenant of Grace wherein Chriſt is made ſin for us, and as many as flee by Faith unto him, are made the righteouſneſs of God through him; and therefore either betake your ſelves to his way, or reſolve on compting with God your ſelves without a Mediator and Surety; or if ye think it a fearful thing to compt thus with God, and if it be certain that many have been condemned for taking the way of Works; Let me earneſtly intreat you to welcome and make more uſe of Chriſts righteouſneſs for obtaining pardon of ſin, and peace with God: This way will do your turn when the other will quite fail you; But as for them who take this way, I will adventure to ſay in his Name, that as certainly as Chriſt was ſmitten, as certainly ſhall pardon and healing come to them; Even to as many as creep in to him, and by believing lay hold on him: And on the other ſide, I ſay in the ſame name to all of you who take not this way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ye ſhall moſt certainly be brought to reckon with God yuur ſelves without a Mediator, and to undergo his curſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenor of the Covenant of Works: Thus this Text ſets before you life and death; God's bleſſing and God's curſe; Life, and God's bleſſing, if ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take your ſelves to Chriſt, as to your alone City of Refuge; And death, and God's fearful curſe if ye do it not; God himſelf make you wiſe to make the right choiſe.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>YE have in the Former Verſes ſomewhat of our Lord's ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and of his ſuffering for ſinners, that he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and bruiſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this Verſe the Prophet proceeds to clear how this came to paſs, that Chriſt Jeſus was made to ſuffer for the Elect, the Seed that God had given him; which he doth by laying down the Occaſion and Fountain-cauſe whence it proceeded, 1. The Occaſion of it in theſe words, <hi>All we like ſheep have gone aſtray;</hi> All the Elect, as well as others, had wandered, and <hi>every one of us had turned to our own way;</hi> We had denuded our ſelves of all right and title to eternal life, and had made our ſelves liable to Gods curſe and wrath through our ſinning. 2. The Fountain-cauſe is, <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all;</hi> When we had all ſtrayed Jehovah took our Lord Jeſus, as the Sacrifices under the Law were taken, and put him in our room, and laid on him the puniſhment due to us for our ſins, and actually purſued him for our debt.</p>
            <p>So the words are an anſwer to that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, How comes it to paſs that our Lord Jeſus ſuffered thus for ſinners? It's anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, The Elect had made themſelves ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the wrath and curſe of God, through their ſtraying; and to keep them from that wrath, God deſigned and provided his Son Jeſus Chriſt to be the Redeemer, and according to the Covenant of Redemption laid on him the puniſhment due to them for their iniquities; In a word, their ſin, and God's appointing him to be Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, made him liable to ſatisfie for all their debt.</p>
            <p>The firſt part of the words holds out our natural diſeaſe; The 2. part holds out Gods gracious cure and remedy.</p>
            <p>In the firſt part we have theſe three, 1. The natural ſtate and condition of all Men and Women, even of the Elect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (who are mainly to be look'd on here) <hi>All we have gone aſtray.</hi> 2. This is illuſtrat by a ſimilitude, <hi>We have gone astray like ſheep.</hi> 3. It is amplified, <hi>Every one of us hath turned to his own way;</hi> Several words being put together to ſet out the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperat ſinful condition whereinto the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect as well as others had brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our natural ſtate and condition is ſet down in this word <hi>ſtraying;</hi> To <hi>ſtray,</hi> is to wander out of the way, to go wrong, to be be wildered; For God hath ſet a rule to men to walk by in the way to life, the rule and way of holineſs, and whoever walk not in that way, do go aſtray, and wander out of the right way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is, as I ſaid, illuſtrat by a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of ſheep; The comparing of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to ſheep here, is not at all to extenuat the ſinfulneſs of their ſtraying; though ſometimes the innocency of that Creature in ſome other compariſons is inſinuated; But it is to hold out the witleſſneſs, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſillineſs ad bruitiſhneſs of their ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Scripture uſually pointing out that Beaſt to be diſpoſed and given to wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:152256:109"/> And both Nature and Experience tells us, that in a Wilderneſs where there is greateſt hazard, they are readieſt to run on the hazard; ſuch is their ſilly, and to ſpeak ſo, fooliſh inclination; Juſt ſo are the Elect by Nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It's amplified by this, <hi>That every one hath turned to his own way;</hi> Before, it was collectively ſet down, <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l we have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray;</hi> But now leſt any ſhould exeem him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it is diſtributively ſet down, <hi>Every one,</hi> even <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> and others ſuch, not one excepted: This <hi>turning to our own way,</hi> holds out two things, 1. It's called our own way, to diſtinguiſh it from Gods way, as it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11. <hi>He gave them up to their own hearts luſts, and they walked in their own counſels,</hi> That is, in their own inventions, or according to their own will, humour and inclination. 2. While it is ſaid, that <hi>every one</hi> turns to his own way, it's to ſhew this, that beſide the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way that all ſinners have to turn away from God, diſtinguiſhed from God's way, every ſinner hath his own particular and peculiar way whereby in his way he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from another ſinner; There is but one way to Heaven, but many ways to Hell, and every one hath his different way, ſome have one predominant luſt, ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; But they all meet here, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one turns from God's way, and every one takes a wrong way of his own.</p>
            <p>Conſidering the ſcope, we ſhall ſhortly and paſſingly point at two general <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> whereof the 1. is this, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes much for folks conceiving and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering of Chriſts ſufferings aright, to be well acquainted with their own ſinful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and diſpoſition; Men will never look rightly on Chriſts ſufferings, nor ſuitably eſteem of him, nor make him, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that holds him and his ſufferings forth cordially welcome, except they have ſome ſenſe of their ſinful nature and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; Hence it was that many of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites</hi> of that time wherein the Lord exerciſed his Miniſtry amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> never welcomed him, nor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed his ſufferings, whereas among the <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners</hi> many were brought to get good of him.</p>
            <p>Not to inſiſt in the <hi>Uſe</hi> of this, only in a word, ſee here a main reaſon why Jeſus Chriſt is ſo meanly thought of, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his ſufferings is ſo little welcomed and eſteemed, even becauſe ſo few walk under the due ſenſe of this, that like loſt ſheep they have gone aſtray.</p>
            <p>The 2d. general <hi>Obſervation</hi> from the ſcope, putting both parts of the Verſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, is this, that we ſhould never look on Chriſt's ſufferings but with reſpect to the Covenant of Redemption, and God's tranſacting with him as our Cautioner; Therefore the laſt part comes in, <hi>The Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all:</hi> For albeit we know that Chriſt hath ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much, yet, if there be not an eye to, and ſome acquaintance with, the Covenant, the riſe of his ſufferings, and God's hand and end in his ſufferings, it will be to no purpoſe; Therefore when <hi>Peter</hi> is to ſpeak of his ſufferings, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. He premits theſe words, <hi>Him being delivered by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminat counſel and fore-knowledge of God,</hi> and then ſubjoyns his being crucified: Looking on Chriſt's ſufferings with reſpect to the Covenant. 1. It lets us know that Chriſt's ſufferings come not by gueſs, but by the eternal counſel o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God, and by vertue of that tranſaction betwixt the Father and the Son, and this takes away the ſcandal off them, which the Prophet ſets himſelf here to remove. 2. It gives Faith acceſs to make uſe of his ſufferings when we look on him as purpoſely deſigned for this end. 3. It holds out the love of God, Father, Son, and Spirit towards Elect Sinners; That howſoever God looked angry like on the Mediator, as perſonating them, and ſuſtaining their room; yet that Jehovah had the deviſing and deſigning of theſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and that he ſent his Son to ſuffer thus, it holds out wonderful love.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And more particularly, from the firſt part of the words, which is the main thing to be marked, <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That all men, even the Elect themſelves not excepted, are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in a moſt ſinful and deſperat ſtate and condition, ſo that if ye would know what they are by Nature, this is a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:152256:110"/> of their ſtate, <hi>All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, and every one hath turned to his own way;</hi> And when it's called <hi>our own way,</hi> there needs no other E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>thete to ſet out the deſperatneſs of it; That which I mean is this, that all men are naturally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe two, 1. They are under guilt before God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Dead in ſins and treſp ſſes, child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en of wrath, and heirs of condemnation,</hi> lyable to the curſe of God by vertue of the Covenant which <hi>Adam</hi> broke. 2. Which is moſtly aimed at here, there is in every one a ſinful nature, a ſinfulneſs or ſinning ſin, an inclination to ſin, every one hath a ſtraying humour; So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſimilitude of ſheep a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ree not to them in that ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e as ſheep are innocent creatures, yet it agrees to them in this ſenſe that they are ſilly fooliſh Creatures; And in this reſpect it is ſaid <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.8. That <hi>all tha imaginations of the thoughts of the heart in man are only evil continually;</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. They are ſaid to be <hi>dead in ſin,</hi> not only in reſpect of their being obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to God's curſe, but in reſpect of their natural deadneſs, of their ſinful nature, and want of ſpiritual life; So <hi>Rom.</hi> 3 9, 10. and forwards, the Apoſtle deſcribes the ſinfulneſs of man's nature at large, not only in reſpect of its guilt, but of its inclination to ſin, and ſays that <hi>their throat is an open Sepulchre;</hi> Inſinuating thereby that men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally are like to a Tomb, and that the Corps within the Tomb is death and ſin, and that all that comes from them ſavours of that; <hi>Their feet are ſwift to ſhed blood, with their tongues they uſe deceit,</hi> &amp;c. Every member and part of the body, and every faculty of the ſoul is bent to that which is evil. Theſe three may further confirm it, 1. If we look in general to what the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks of men by nature, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, and 5. Chapters; They being as it is, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57. <hi>penult, As the raging Sea that casts out dirt and mire continually;</hi> It is alwayes moving and working one way or other, and more eſpecially in a ſtorm, ſo that though at one tide ye ſhould ſweep the Shore never ſo clean, it will be as foul and dirty the next Tide that cometh; So are theſe hearts of ours (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. And <hi>Jude verſ</hi> 13.) <hi>foaming out their own ſhame;</hi> And <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.5. <hi>The ſpirit that dwells in us luſteth to envy;</hi> It hath as great eagerneſs after, and as great delight in ſin, as a Drunkard hath after, and in drink. 2.

               </gap>ominations that are in the World, and the riſe of theſe particular evils that are in believers and Saints men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture, as in <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and others: But this ſame corrupt nature, this body of death, as it is called. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. All which ſtrongly prove a fire to be within, when there is ſuch a ſmoak with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. 3. We may confirm it from well-grounded reaſon, for it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; If the root be of ſuch a nature, can the branches be otherwayes? Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean thing? No, not one, <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. When <hi>Adam</hi> fell the root was corrupted, and the branches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be freſh; the fountain was defiled, and the ſtreams cannot be clean and clear: Hence when <hi>Adam</hi> begot <hi>Seth,</hi> an Elect in whom the Church was continued, it is ſaid, that <hi>he begat a ſon after his own likeneſs, Gen.</hi> 5. He himſelf was created after Gods Image, but begat children after his own Image.</p>
            <p>Though this be a commonly received Doctrine, yet its not without good reaſon, nor for no uſe inſiſted on ſo much here and in other Scriptures; We ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeak a little to theſe four <hi>Uſes</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>The 1. <hi>Uſe</hi> of it ſerves for Information; and we may make it a looking-glaſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may ſee clearly our own moſt ſinful ſtate and condition; Would ye know what ye are by nature? This Text tells you that not only all men have ſtrayed, but that each of us, or <hi>every one of uc hath turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:152256:110"/> to his own way;</hi> But knowing how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy we are to ſhift the challenge, we would be perſwaded that we are by nature lyable to Gods curſe for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, dead in ſin, and inclined to all evil; Sheep are no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to go the wrong way, and will no more readily ſtray if they want a Shepherd, then we are inclined to do: There is a common word in many of your mouths, that we are all ſinners by nature, but when it's ſearched into, we find that there is much ignorance amongſt you of what it means; many count themſelves to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, only becauſe of their being guilty of the firſt ſin, and ſo put no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the firſt ſin and Original ſin, which is an effect that flows from, and follows upon the firſt ſin; The firſt ſin was <hi>Adam</hi>'s deed, and is legally ours being imputed to us; As it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>Death reigned over all, even over them that had not ſinned after the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of</hi> Adam<hi>'s tranſgreſſion,</hi> becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> in his ſtanding and falling ſtood in our room, repreſenting all mankind that was to come of him; But Original ſin is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in us, and cleaveth cloſs to us, and is that which we are born and bred and grow up with; And therefore ye would diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh theſe ſins, that ye may know that ye are not only guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſinful deed but that ye hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For whom did he ſmite him? for Sinners, for ſtraying Sheep, for Covenant-breakers, for ſuch as had gone a whoring from God, and were bent to ſin againſt him, I mean the Elect. 5. When was it that he ſuffered for them? even when they were ſtraying, rejecting, deſpiſing, nodding the head at him, ſpitting in his face, and ſaying away with him, even then he is praying and dying for them: Now put all theſe together, that ſuch a price ſhall be exacted of ſuch a Cautioner, and for ſuch Sinners, and at ſuch a time, behold &amp; ſee therein how God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends his love to us, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>In that while we were yet ſinners Christ died for us;</hi> when we were in our ſin, not praying to him, nor in capacity to pray or give him thanks for any thing that he did or ſuffered, he then died for us; Is there any thing here but freedom of Grace? and does not this exceeding high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend the love of God, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts the Debt due by us of his Son, and the wonderful love of the Mediator and Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that at ſuch a time and for ſuch tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions he ſhould pay ſuch a price?</p>

There is alſo in them an Encouragement to Believing; It was for Sinners, ſuch as we are, that Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered all that he ſuffered, which may be ground of hope and encouragement to ſtep forward; and if neither our need, nor Chriſt's being a Saviour willing to make Sinners welcome will prevail, we know not what will do it: It will turn to this, and ye will be put to it, Whether are ye Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? and if Sinners, whether is it not a deſperate thing to ly under Sin and Wrath? If ye be not Sinners we have no warrand to propoſe this Doctrine to you, to invite or make you welcome to a Saviour; but if ye grant that ye are Sinners, will ye content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ly under Sin? will ye be able to bear it out againſt God? or think ye that ye will be well enough for all that? and if ye dare not reſolve to ly under Sin, I would aſk, what way will ye win from it? think ye it eaſie to win from under it? muſt not the Juſtice of God be ſatisfied? ſome of you think that ye can pray your ſelves out of Sin, but what need was there of Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings if a ſatisfaction might have been made to Juſtice another way? and if none but Chriſt can ſatisfie, it turns to this, that by all means ye would make uſe of him, elſe ye will moſt certainly drown and die in your ſins; And this is the thing that we would commend to you, that under the ſenſe of ſin, and in the faith of Gods conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending love, ye wouldflee to Jeſus Chriſt, and give him employment for making your peace with God, and taking away your ſin and ſanctifying of you; O but this be ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Sinners; and if ye think your ſelves Sinners, prejudge not your ſelves of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of a Saviour.</p>

               <p>In theſe few words then, we have, 1. ſomething ſpoken of iniquity which three Parties have ſome acts about, to wit, 1.

Yea, 3. If Jeſus Chriſt were the ſinner formally, it would incapacitat him to be our Cautioner, to pay the penalty, or to ſatisfie Juſtice the debt of our ſins: We would not have ſpoken ſo much to this, were it not that this ſame place is preſſed in a moſt faſtidious manner by the abuſers of the grace of God to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their errour: So then we take this in ſhort to be the meaning of this part of the <hi>verſe,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt did bear the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to us for our ſins.</p>

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:152256:114"/> by Chriſt, that God made him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceed for all the ſins of the Elect? But if you look upon the words in their true meaning, they are a clear reaſon why he was wounded, exceedingly bruiſed and chaſtened, and why he endured ſo many ſtripes, even becauſe all the ſins of all his Elect met on him, becauſe he was made to bear the puniſhment of them all; Alſo the words following clear it, <hi>He was cut off out of the land of the living, for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſtricken;</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>He was made a curſe for us,</hi> He ſuffered, <hi>the juſt for the unyuſt;</hi> He actually and really ſuffered that which we ſhould have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: If it be asked, Wh t is this, <hi>to lay iniquity on Christ?</hi> Or how is it ſaid, that the iniquity of the Elect <hi>was laid on him?</hi> Or in what reſpect? I anſwer, 1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Gods eternal Covenant; the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due for our ſins is laid upon him by an eternal deliberat Counſel or Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Perſons of the God-head; Wherein (as we ſhew before) Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Surety for us, accepts of, and engages to pay our debt. 2. In reſpect of Gods actual purſuing Chriſt having thus engaged himſelf, putting in his hand the Cup, and making him drink, and the Bill of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and making him countable. 3. In reſpect of Gods acceptation of that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which Chriſt performed and payed down for them.</p>
               <p>This being the meaning of the words, we come to point at ſome things from them, and the very opening of them may give us ſome In-ſight in the way of the Goſpel, and of a notable ground of footing to our Faith, If we could rightly apprehend God making this tranſaction with the Mediator, we might not only have a ground to our Faith, but a great encouragement to come to Chriſt, and to reſt on him who hath thus fiſted himſelf in our room before the Tribunal of Diving Juſtice, and it would waken and warm Faith and Love towards him.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Obſerve</hi> here more particularly, 1. That all the Elect People of God are lyIng under iniquity even as others; This we ſpoke to the laſt day, and ſhall not repeat what was then ſaid; It's with reſpect to iniquity in the Elect that all the buſineſs of Redemption is tranſacted, and from hence as the occaſion, it hath its riſe, even from God's being offended, and from the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a Mediator; For this doth preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our debt, and a ſtanding ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, till Chriſt interpoſed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From its being ſaid before, that <hi>every one turned to his own way,</hi> and here, that <hi>the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all, Obſerve,</hi> that every one of the Elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the common ſtate of ſin wherein all are, hath his own particular guilt that is <hi>in his own way;</hi> This is clearly holden out here, while it is ſaid, that not only <hi>like ſheep we have gone astray,</hi> but that <hi>every one hath turned to his own way;</hi> Which as it holds forth a way in them all different from God's way, ſo alſo a way in every one of them ſomewhat different from anothers way; And this is called a <hi>walking in the counſel of our own heart, Pſal.</hi> 81. and a mans <hi>own ſore,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.29. and a mans <hi>own iniquity, Pſal.</hi> 18.23.

To clear it a little, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that ſin is peculiar to a Believer, or may be called his <hi>own way,</hi> in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; 1. In reſpect of his being more addicted to one ſin then another, which is uſually called a mans predominant; Two men may both be covetous and paſſionat, but the one of them may be called a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man, becauſe he is eſpecially given to that ſin of covetouſneſs, and the other may be called a paſſionat man, becauſe he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially given to paſſion. 2. In reſpect of ſome peculiar aggravating circumſtances; Though we will not dar particularly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine as to perſons, yet if we look thorow all men and women, it will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily found that there is ſome ſin which in reſpect of ſome or ſeveral aggravations, is in ſome a greater ſin then it is in others; And hereby God hath given ground of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation to all; There is not a man (as we juſt now hinted) but readily he hath an evil which is at a greater hight in him then in another; As for inſtance, one may be given more to the ſin of Drunkenneſs,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:152256:114"/> another more to Hypocriſie, another more to Uncleanneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I do not ſpeak ſo much here of the divers kinds of ſin, as of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral aggravations of this or that ſin that they are given to; ſuch and ſuch a man may have aggravations that will aggrege ſuch a predominant evil in him far beyond what it is in others: And it is from this ground that a Believer not in a complementing way, but moſt really and ſincerely, doeth call and account himſelf the <hi>chief of ſinners,</hi> becauſe there are ſome aggravations that elevat his ſin above the ſins of others, or above that ſame ſin in others; as a weak Believer may have ſome one good thing in him more commendable than it is in a ſtronger Believer, ſo the ſtronger Believer may have ſome one ſin that in reſpect of its aggravations, may give him ground to look on himſelf as beyond others in ſin.</p>

                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. It ſerves much for our Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in as far as this adds to our ſinfulneſs; There are none of us, but beſide the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of ſinning incident to all, we have ſomething that is peculiar to our ſelves, we have <hi>our own way</hi> wherewith we are charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able above and beyond others; we will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily all grant that we are ſinners, but who of us will take with our particul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. The ſecond Uſe which is the ſcope, ſerves to ſhew the exceeding greatneſs of Chriſts ſufferings; O! what a ſhock he was in when he had not only all the common ſins of the Elect to ſatisfie for, but when all their peculiar ſins with their reſpective aggravations, rend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>zvouzed and trifted on him? It ſerves likewiſe to exalt the free Grace of God, and the condeſcendency of our bleſſed Lord Jeſus who took in altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his making ſatisfaction for them when there were ſeveral ſorts of them, as if every one of the Elect had been ſet to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a new ſin; what great and ſore ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was here when he condeſcended to drink the Cup that had the wonderful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of all the ſins of the Elect wrung into it? when not only in groſs he takes on the ſins of the Elect, but this and that mans particular ſins, which were all reckoned and ſummed on Chriſts account, and for which he was made to ſatisfie; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Juſtice proceeded equally and equipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently; this notably confirmed the reality of Chriſts ſatisfaction, by ſuffering what all the Elect ſhould have ſuffered eternally, or the equivalent of it; for if there had not been a proportional ſatisfaction in his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, wherefore ſerves ſuch an enumeration of his ſufferings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. The third Uſe ſerves to lead us in to know how much we are in Chriſts Debt, and what a great encouragement we have to believe, and withall, what notable ground of conſolation Believers have: I ſay, 1. It ſhews how much we are in Chriſts Debt, when we take a view of all our ſins, and conſider that there was a particular view taken of them in the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not only all our common ſins, but even all the particular and peculiar ſins of Believers were reckoned unto Chriſt the Cautioner, and put on his account, and he engaged to ſatisfie for all, and pay the whole Reckoning; doth it not lay a great obligation on us to him who counted for the leaſt farthing of our Debt? we like a pack of bank-rupt Dyvours did take on the Debt, and the Accompt was put in his Hand, not only (as I juſt now ſaid) of all our common ſins, but of this and that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſin, with all their ſeveral aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the ſinful circumſtances that did highten them; and he ſatisfied for them all: And of this we would take ſpecial notice, for it may readily wrong us to look upon the Covenant of Redemption as a Bargain in groſs; there is a particularneſs in it, to ſhew not only the ſoveraignty but the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Juſtice, and alſo the riches of Gods Grace, and of the great condeſcendency of Chriſts love to elect ſinners. 2. It's a great encouragement to believe; for even theſe ſins that would fright and ſkar ſerious and exerciſed Souls from coming forward to Chriſt, were all compted on Chriſt's ſcorce,

That Juſtice might be diſtinctly, exactly, and fully ſatisfied, and that it might be known that it is ſo, he would needs be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his honour, to his declarative, or manifeſted honour and glory, which ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by man's fall, and by the many great and variouſly aggravated ſins of the Elect, and would have his Juſtice, as I ſaid, fully ſatisfied: And therefore as there is a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of a Book, wherein all the Elect are written for whom Chriſt ſhould ſatisfie, ſo there is a Volumn of what, and for what he ſhould ſatisfie that there may be a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſatisfaction and price told down to Juſtice. 2. Believers may have a more full view of the way of Grace, and of Chriſts

Yes, ſaith the Text, for theſe ſins ſo and ſo aggravated, were not unknown to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor to the Mediator when thou waſt bargained about; Nay, theſe ſins with their aggravations were expreſly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Covenant of Redemption, and there is no ſin already committed; or to be committed by thee in time, that was not conſidered before time: What was your poſture, Believers, when God <hi>paſſed by, and caſt the lap or skirt of his love over you?</hi> Were you not <hi>caſt out in the open field, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in your own blood, with your navels uncut, having no eye to pity you,</hi> &amp;c.

But as to let you know that ye are no worſe in time then ye were conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be before ye had a beeing; So, to aggrege the Love and Grace of God in Chriſt, and to draw you in to him, that ſince God and Chriſt the Mediator in the tranſaction about your Redemption, ſtood not on your ſinfulneſs, ye may not ſtand on it when ſeriouſly taken with, but may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his Righteouſneſs, and ſay, Be it ſo Lord, I am content to take what thou free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offereſt; And the more ſinful and loſt ye be in your ſelves when ſuitably affected therewith, the more wonderful is the grace of God in the Plot of your Redemption, the more ſtrong is your conſolation, and the greater ground of believing have ye; your ſins do not ſurprize God nor the Mediator, the Bargain was made before your ſins were committed, and therefore the price muſt reach them even when they are all ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up together; He was content to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of them ſo as to ſatisfie for them, and bleſſed be he for evermore that accepted of the bargain, and payed the price according to his undertaking.</p>

            <p>IN the former <hi>verſe</hi> the Prophet hath aſſerted three moſt wonderful truths, and very concerning to the people of God, and yet ſuch truths as will not be eaſie got digeſted by natural reaſon. 1. That our Lord Jeſus was put to ſore and ſad ſufferings, <hi>He was wounded and bruiſed,</hi> &amp;c. 2. That theſe ſad ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings were for us the Elect; it was for our ſins, and what was due to the Elect, he was made to bear them, <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities.</hi> 3. The end of theſe ſufferings, or the effect that followed on them to us,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:152256:116"/> pardon of ſin, peace with God, and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was on him, and by his stripes we are healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And each of theſe being more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then another, therefore the Prophet goes on to clear their riſe, which is no leſs wonderful; How it came to paſs that he ſuffered, and ſuffered ſo much, and that we have ſuch benefite by his ſufferings; It could not (would he ſay) be otherwayes, but it behoved our Lord Jeſus to ſuffer, and to ſuffer ſo much, and for us; Neitheir was it unreaſonable that it ſhould be for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, <hi>For we had all like lost ſheep gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, and every one of us had turned to his own way:</hi> And there was no way of relief for us but by Chriſt's ſtepping into our room, and interpoſing for us, and ingaging to pay our debt; and by vertue of that interpoſition and bargain, <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all:</hi> And therefore, 1. Would ye have the reaſon of Chriſt's ſo great ſufferings? Here it is, the Elect had many ſins, and he interpoſing for them, their compt was ſcored-out, and they were reckoned on his ſcore. 2. If the cauſe and reaſon be asked, How it came to paſs tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Chriſt ſuffered ſo much for us? Here it is, he undertook to ſatisfie for our iniquities, and God imputed them to him; Even as if a Dyvour were purſued, and one ſhould ſtep in and be Cautioner for him, and being enacted Surety, ſhould take on, and become lyable for the Debt; The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting it of him is the laying it on him. But 3. If it be aſked how it comes to paſs that his ſufferings become our healing, and bring peace to us? It is anſwered, it was ſo tranſacted and agreed upon; He was content to pay all our debt, and the Father accepted of his payment for ours; Our bleſſed Lord Jeſus engaging and ſatisfying, the Elect are ſet free, and Juſtice betaketh it ſelf to him as the more reſponſal Party; This is the ſcope of the words, which though but few, yet exceeding full and ſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ficant, as holding out the fountain and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal grounds of the Goſpel: We ſhall look upon them in theſe three reſpects, 1. As they imply a Covenant and Tranſaction, whereby the Elects ſins are tranſacted on Chriſt, and his righteouſneſs is made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of to them; Chriſt undertaking to pay their debt, and Jehovah accepting thereof, and promiſing that his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made for the behove of the Elect, ſhall be applyed to them. 2. In reſpect of the effects, which are two; Which though they ſeem contrary, the one to the other, yet they are well conſiſtent together, and ſubordinat the one of them to the other; The 1. is of Juſtice on Chriſts ſide, he ſatisfies for the debt due by the Elect. The 2. is of Mercy and Grace to the Elect, which is alſo implyed, but comparing theſe words with the former, it is very clear; He is wounded and bruiſed, and they are healed, the chaſtiſement of their peace was on him, the imputing of their debt to him, makes that it is not imputed to them. 3. In reſpect of the influence that the eternal Covenant hath on theſe effects, it lays down the way how theſe may be juſtly brought about, which is the ſcope of all, even to ſhew how Chriſt Jeſus being the innocent Son of God, and without ſin, was made lyable to the debt of the Elects ſin; He became Cautioner for them, and is made lyable on that account to ſatisfie for them; It clears alſo how his ſufferings ſtood for theirs; which may ſeem to be unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unjuſt among men, that the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of an innocent party ſhould ſtand for the guilty; It was ſo articled in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption that the Son as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator interpoſing and undertaking to pay the Elects debt, the Lord Jehovah the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſhould not reckon it on their ſcore, but on the Mediators, and that he ſhould count for it: The Prophet in every <hi>verſe</hi> almoſt, is ſtriking on the ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſtring of this noble plot and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of God conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>firſt Doctrine</hi> ſuppoſed here is, that there is an eternal Covenant and Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the Lord Jehovah and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, wherein the whole buſineſs concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Redemption and Salvation of the Elect is c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherein we have, 1. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Parties, <hi>the Lord Jehovah</hi> the Party of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended on the one ſide, and <hi>the Lord Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, Him,</hi> the Party engaging to ſatisfie on the other ſide; Which ſhews the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Redemption of the Elect as to them, and the certainty of their Salvation; And withal, the immutability of Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for the Parties are not mutable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but on the one ſide <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and on the other ſide the <hi>Mediator,</hi> though conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as to be Incarnat and the Head of the Elect; This whole buſineſs bred there, to wit in the Council of the God-head, for promoving of that great end, the glorifying of the Grace and Juſtice of God in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects Salvation. 2. Whereabout is it? It's about this matter, how to get the Elect ſaved from the curſe, to which on their foreſeen fall and ſinning they were made ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; Redemption neceſſarily preſuppoſing mans fall and the Covenant of Works, to which the certification and threatning was added, <hi>The ſoul that ſins ſhall die,</hi> and the Elect preſuppoſed as fallen as well as others, are lyable to that curſe, except a ſatisfact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them do interveen; So that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are conſidered as having ſins, and as being in themſelves loſt: And what is the Lord Jehovah and the Mediator doing, what are they about in this Covenant? It's how to get the puniſhment due to the Elect for their ſin removed from them: And theſe perſons <hi>us all</hi> in the Text, are all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, wherein there is imlyed a paticular conſideration of them that are deſigned to Life and Salvation, and a particular conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of all their ſins, and of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral aggravations, that there may be a proportion betwixt the price and the wrong that God hath gotten by their ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. 3. The occaſion of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the reaſon why it behoved to be, is holden forth in the firſt, <hi>All we like ſheep had gone aſtray, and turned every one of us to his own way;</hi> The Elect as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What is the price, what is the ſtipulation, or that which the Mediator is ingaged to, and that which provoked Juſtice required? It is even ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for all the wrongs that the ſins of the Elect did or were to do to the Majeſty of God; Theſe ſins deſerved wounding and ſmiting, and the Capitulation runs on this, that Juſtice ſhall get that of the Mediator, that the Elect may be ſpared; And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring this <hi>verſe</hi> with the former, upon the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:152256:117"/> one ſide our Lord Jeſus gives his back to bear their burden, and engages to ſatisfie for their debt, and to undergo the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to them; And upon the other ſide Jehovah accepts of this offer and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and lays over the burden of their debt on him; As the Mediator inſtates and inacts himſelf in their room for payment of their debt, ſo he lays it on him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of it. 5. The end of this great Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction, to wit, of the undertaking on the Mediators ſide, and of the acceptation on the Fathers ſide, is, that the Elect may have pardon and peace, and that by his ſtripes they may be healed; That Juſtice may ſpare them and purſue him, and that the diſcharge of the debt purchaſed by him, may be made forth-coming to them, as if they had payed the debt themſelves, or had never been owing any thing to Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Hence <hi>Deductions</hi> may be made holding forth ſeveral points of truth, As, 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the determinatneſs of the number of the Elect. 2. Concerning the vertue and efficacy of the price which the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor hath payed, and the fulneſs of his Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. 3.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ground and matter of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul ſatisfaction and raviſhment that it is here; that God ſhould be thus minding the ſalvation of the Elect, and thus contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ordering the work of their Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that their Debt ſhall be payed, and yet nothing (to ſpeak ſo) come out of their Purſe; and that by ſo excellent a mean as is the intervention of the Mediator, and that this ſhall notwithſtanding of the dear price payed by him, be made freely forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming to the Elect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. O!

            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. The ſecond Uſe ſerves to ſtir us up to ſtudy to know ſomewhat, and to know more of the way of Salvation under this notion of God's covenanting with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; not thereby to aſtrict God to mans laws &amp; forms, but for helping us to the better &amp; more eaſie up-taking of theſe great things; and that we may ſee that the ſalvation of the Elect is ſure, foraſmuch as it it laid down by way of Bargain, Tranſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The 2d. thing here, Is the native effect or fruit of the Covenant, and that which the Prophet aims at; even to ſhew how it came to paſs that Chriſt ſuffered ſo much, becauſe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:152256:118"/> it was ſo covenanted, ſtatute and ordained, becauſe he was by a prior contrivance and contract ſubſtituted with his own hearty conſent in the room of the Elect who had many and great ſins to compt for; whence <hi>

            <p>There are two words which we ſhall a little clear in this Doctrine; and ſecondly, give ſome reaſons of it; and then thirdly, we ſhall ſpeak to ſome Uſes from it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the two words or things in the Doctrine to be cleared, they are theſe, Firſt, What we mean by this, when we ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y iniquity is laid upon Chriſt; the ſecond is, How it is laid upon Chriſt? As to the firſt, When we ſay in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quity is laid upon Chriſt, we mean theſe things ſhortly, 1. That our Lord Jeſus is really made comptable and lyable to Juſtice for theſe iniquiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s as if they had been his own, by vertue of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; in Gods Juſtice he having engaged to pay Elects Debt, his engagement makes him lyable to it. 2. We mean thats not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Lord Jeſus is made lyable to our Debt, but that really he is made to ſatisfie for it,; In ſhort, we have done the wrong, but he makes the amends as if he had done the wrong himſelf, <hi>The juſt</hi> ſatisfied <hi>for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt;</hi> He <hi>in whoſe mouth there was no guile,</hi> was made to ſatisfie for guilty Sinners as if he had been the guilty perſon himſelf; By the ſins of the Elect God's declarative Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs ſuffered; Creatures malapertly brake his Command, and his Juſtice was wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Creatures topped with it, to ſay ſo, and that even after the Curſe was pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and after they had believed the Devil more than God; But our Lord Jeſus comes in to make the amends, and the Holineſs of God is vindicate by his obedience, and his Juſtice is vindicate by his ſuffering; the Elect have deſerved wounding, but ſays the Mediator, let the wounds which they have deſerved come on me, let them be mine; and thus he makes reparation of the wrong and the amend, becauſe though the Elect be ſpared, yet hereby the Lord is known to be as really and as much a hater of ſin, and as juſt in fulfilling his threatning, as if the Elect had been ſmitten in their own perſons; becauſe he puniſhed Sin in his own Son; yea by this means he is ſeen ſo much the more to be holy, ſevere, pure and ſpotleſs; and that the Son of God ſweetly ſubmits to his becoming Man; and to theſe terrible Sufferings for ſatisfying Divi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; Here, O! here the ſpotleſs and ſeverity of the Juſtice of God, as alſo the greatneſs of the glory of the free Grace and Love ſhine forth conſpicuouſly. 3. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes this, That really there was a convent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and turning of that Wrath and of theſe ſufferings proportionably on Jeſus Chriſt, which Juſtice was to have inflicted on the Elect eternally if he had not interpoſed for them; and that altogether in a full Cup propined to him and put in his hand; that which would have been in ſo many drops an eternal Hell to Elect Sinners, is made to meet on him in one great Sea; He gets it to drink up dregs and all; in which reſpect <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. He is ſaid to be <hi>made a curſe for us;</hi> The Lord will not paſs from one Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what was due to him, and will be ſatisfied with no leſs than proportionable ſatisfaction to that which was due to Juſtice by the Elect themſelves, though the Surety was his own only Son; Therefore it behov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt to come under the Curſe, in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:152256:118"/> which ſenſe he is ſaid to <hi>be made a curſe for us,</hi> which ſuppoſeth that he endured the ſame curſe and puniſhment due to the Elects ſins in all the eſſentials of it; He behoved to die, and to have his Soul ſeparate from his Body for a time, and for a ſeaſon to want in a great meaſure the comfortable mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of Gods favour and preſence, and to have wrath purſuing him, and to have horrour ſeizing upon him; though our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord being ſpotleſs and without ſin, and having a good Conſcience, was not capable of theſe ſome way accidental circumſtances, of Unbelief, ſinful Anxiety and Deſperation, that ſinful finite Creatures are lyable to when they come under wrath.</p>
            <p>The 2d. word or thing to be cleared in the Doctrine, is, How are Iniquities laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt Jeſus? In three reſpects, 1. In reſpect of the eternal Tranſaction betwixt Jehovah and him as Mediator ſuſtaining the perſon of the Elect; even as one man hath anothers Debt laid on him, when by a Law-ſentence he is made lyable to it; ſo is Chriſt made lyable to the Elects iniquity, when their account is blotted out, and the Debt as it were written down in his accompt to be ſatisfied for. 2. In reſpect of Juſtice purſuing him for it; When he becometh Cautioner and full Debitor for the Elect, he is put to pay their Debt to the leaſt Farthing; the Lord muſters up againſt him his terrours, and commands <hi>his ſword to awake and to ſmite the man that is his fellow.</hi> But 3ly. and mainly. In reſpect of his actual undergoing the Curſe and Suffering, that which the Elect ſhould h ve ſuffered; for It is not the work of a Court to paſs a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but alſo to ſee to the execution of the ſentence; not only are orders given to the ſword to awake and ſmite, but the ſword falls on and ſmites him actually; and though from the apprehenſion of the anger of God, as Man, and without the ſenſible and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting manifeſtation of his Fathers love, and his ſeemingly forſaking him for a time; He prayed, <hi>Father if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me;</hi> yet it will not be, and he ſubmits moſt ſweetly to it; and not only is the cup put in his hand, but the dregs of wrath are, as it were, wrung out into it, and he muſt needs drink it up all; which manifeſtly kythes in his <hi>agony</hi> in the garden when he is made to <hi>ſweat blood;</hi> and in his complaint (if we may ſo call it) <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, and what ſhall I ſay?</hi> and in theſe ſtrange words uttered by him on the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> all which tell us plainly, that not only was he enacted Sure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, and had the ſentence paſt on him, but that real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſatisfied, and had the ſentence execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him; that in his Soul he was really pierced and wounded, and that with far deeper wounds then theſe were which the Souldiers by the ſpear and nails made in his Body; before the Elects diſcharge of their Debt could be procured and obtained: What it was more particularly that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, the following words hold out: But here it's clear, that he ſuffered really, and ſuffered much; that not only he undertook to pay, but that he was actually purſued and made to lay down to the leaſt Farthing whatever was due to Juſtice by the Elect: And this is the cauſe why theſe words are brought in as the reaſon why he ſuffered ſo much, even becauſe ſo many and ſo great ſins with all their aggravations were laid upon him; and if his ſufferings were not great and undergone for this end, to ſatisfy for the Elects Debt that they might be ſet free, the Prophets ſcope would not be reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither would there be a ſuitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion betwixt the latter and the foregoing words.</p>
            <p>As for the 2d. To wit ſome <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the Doctrine, we ſhall ſhortly give you theſe <hi>three</hi> why the Elects ſins were laid on Chriſt and put on his account, and why he was made to underly the compleat puniſhment of them by vertue of the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. 1. Becauſe it did much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the glory of God, for he had deſigned in his eternal Council that his Grace ſhould be glorified in the ſalvation of the Elect; and that his Juſtice ſhould alſo be glorified in puniſhing of ſin either in themſelves or in their Cautioner; and as free Grace and Mercy muſt be glorious in ſaving the Elect, and Juſtice in being ſatisfied for their ſins; ſo it's to that end, that ſince the Elect can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:152256:119"/> pay their own Debt, that their Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pay it, and pay it fully, that the Lord in exacting ſatisfaction from him in their name, may be known to be juſt. 2. This way makes much for the confirmation of the Faith of the believing Elect and for their conſolation; for the confirmation of their Faith, for what can Juſtice demand that it hath not gotten? it is fully ſatisfied; and then for their conſolation; ſeing the Father put his own Son to ſuffer, and to ſo great ſuffering for them, what is it that they may not confidently expect from ſuch a Fountain? 3. This ſerves to hold out the wonderful great obligation of the Elect to God and to the Mediator; for the greater their ſin was the more he ſuffered; the greater their Debt was, the more he payed; and they are the more in his common and the greater Debters to him; and ought the more to love him, and their duty for his ſake; as it is ſaid of the woman, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. <hi>She loved much for much was forgiven her;</hi> ſo this way of paying the Elects Debt, calls and ſtrongly pleads, and alſo makes way for much warm and tender love in them to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In the 3d. place, We come to the <hi>Uſes</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine;</hi> To which I ſhall premit this word of deſire to you, That ye would not look on theſe things as taſteleſs or unſavoury; for had we not had theſe precious truths to open up to you, we ſhould have had no meetings to this purpoſe, no ground to ſpeak of life to you, nor any the leaſt hope or expectation of life; And indeed it may be ſadly regrated, that amongſt a multitude of profeſſing People, theſe ſubſtantial truths of the Goſpel are ſo werſh and little reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the moſt part; which too evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the unconcerned, wearying, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing poſture of ſome, &amp; in the ſlumbering &amp; ſleeping of others in our publick Aſſemblies; If our hearts were in a right frame, half a word, to ſay ſo, to this purpoſe would be a wakening and allaruming to us; Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this is a great priviledge in it ſelf; Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens may and do know ſomething of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duties, but it's a priviledge which we have and they want, that the fundamental truths of the Goſpel are amongſt us and not amongſt them.</p>
            <p>The 1. <hi>Uſe</hi> ſerves to let us ſee the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Glory of Grace and Truth; of Mercy and Juſtice ſhining clearly here; Can there be any greater mercy, and more pure mercy than this, that the Lord ſhould be gracious to ſinners, and to great ſinners, <hi>rhat had turned every one of them to their own way,</hi> in providing a Mediator, and ſuch a Mediator, in providing ſuch a help for them, and <hi>laying that help upon one that is mighty,</hi> and that he ſhould have done this of his own head (ſo to ſpeak with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) when the Elect were in their ſins, and when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re was nothing to be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive or meritorious cauſe of it; And that the Father ſhould have laid this weight of puniſhment on Chriſt the Son of his love, and purſued him at this rate of holy ſeverity for ſinners debt? O! what grace and mercy ſhines here? And 2. The ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Juſtice of God doth alſo here wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully manifeſt it ſelf; O! How exact is Juſtice, when it will not quite a farthing even to the ſecond Perſon of the Godhead, when he became Man, and man's Surety? But ſince he hath put himſelf in the room of ſinners, <hi>The L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed maketh all their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities to meet on him;</hi> This is matter of admiration to Men and Angels, to conſider how Juſtice and Mercy run in one Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and ſhine in one Covenant, the one of them not incroaching upon the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. We may gather from this ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and clearneſs in the very great ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; For theſe things are here put together, 1. That he ſuffered for all the Elect, <hi>Us all.</hi> 2. For all the ſins of all the Elect, and for all the ſins of all the Elect in their higheſt and moſt aggravating circumſtances, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reckoning of them all, as it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt up, they are all put on his ſcore. 3. All theſe meet togcther in a great Sea and ſhock upon him at one time, as they came from ſeveral Airts, like ſo many Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; Or they were like ſo many Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or rather Armies of men, all meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together and Marſhalled, to fall pell mell (to ſay ſo) on him; One ſin were enough to condemn, the many ſins of one is more, but all the ſins of all the Elect is
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:152256:119"/> much more; They deſerved to have lyen in Hell eternally, but he coming in their room all their ſins met as the violent preaſs of Waters on him; What then behoved his ſufferings to be, when he was ſo put to it for all the ſins of all the Elect, and that at once?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. We may gather hence a juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the truth of Chriſt's ſatisfaction, and a ground of refutation of the <hi>Socinian</hi> error, a blaſphemy which is moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to be once mentioned, as if our Lord had ſuffered all this only to give us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and as if there had not been a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable ſatisfaction in his ſufferings to our debt, nor an intention to ſatisfie Juſtice thereby: Every <hi>verſe</hi> almoſt, not to ſay every word in this Chapter refutes this; If he had not ſatisfied for our ſins, why is he ſaid to be here on the matter put in our room? And if his ſufferings had not been very great, what needed the Prophet to ſhew the reaſon of his great ſufferings, in all the ſins of all the Elect their meeting on him? There was ſure a particular reſpect had to this, even to ſhew that the meeting of all theſe ſins of all the Elect together upon Chriſt, did cauſe and procure great and extream ſufferings to him; He ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the more that they had had ſo many ſins, ſeing their many ſins are given for the cauſe of his ſo much ſuffering.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. Here is great ground of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to believing ſinners, <hi>Out of this eater comes meat, and out of this ſtrong comes ſweet;</hi> The more ſharp and bitter theſe ſufferings were to Chriſt, the report of them is in ſome reſpect the more ſavoury and ſweet to the Believer, whoſe effectual Calling diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers his Election; And indeed I cannot tell how many grounds of conſolation Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have from this Doctrine; But 1. If they have ſinned, there is here a Saviour provided for them. 2. This Saviour hath undertaken their debt. 3. He hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken it with the Fathers allowance. 4. As he hath undertaken it, ſo the Father hath laid on him all their iniquity. 5. All the Elect come in here together in one Roll, and there is but one Covenant, and one Mediator for them all; The ſin of the poor body, of the weakeſt and meaneſt, is tranſacted on him, as well as the ſin of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> that great friend of God, and Father of the Faithful, and the Salvation of the one is as ſure as the Salvation of the other; All Believers from the ſtrongeſt to the weakeſt have but one Right of Charter to Heaven, but one holding of the Inheritance. 6. The Lord hath laid on him all the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of all the Elect with a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all their aggravations, and to all the ſeveral ways that they have turned to ſin; Their Original ſin, and all their actual tranſgreſſions, with their particular predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minants, as to their puniſhment; And there is reaſon for it, becauſe the Elect could not ſatisfie for the leaſt ſin; And it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the glorifying of Grace, that the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the work of their Salvation be not halfed, but ſolely and ſinglely aſcribed and given to God, therefore the ſatisfaction comes all on the Mediators account, and none of it on theirs. 7. All this is really done and performed by the Mediator with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuit or requeſt of the Elect, or of the Believer, at leaſt as the procuring cauſe thereof; He buyes and purchaſes what is needful for them, and pays for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge; And they have no more to do, but to call for an extract, and to take a ſealed remiſſion by his blood: The application whereof, the <hi>Uſes</hi> that follow will give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 5. Since it is ſo, then none would think little of ſin; which checks the great preſumption that is amongſt men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who think little and light of ſin, and that it is an eaſie matter to come by the pardon of it; They think there is no more to do but barely and ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>chly to confeſs they have ſinned, and to ſay, God is merciful, and hence they conclude that God will not reckon with them: But, did he reckon with the Mediator, and that ſo holily ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidly and ſeverely too, and will he, think ye, ſpare you?

            <p>And therefore 6ly, As the cloſe of all, ſee here the abſolute neceſſity of ſharing in Chriſts ſatisfaction, and of having an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:152256:120"/> therein by this Covenant derived unto you, elſe know that ye muſt count for your own ſins; And if ſo, woe eternally to you; Therefore either betake your ſelves to the Mediator, that by his Eye-ſalve ye may ſee, that by his Gold ye may be inriched, that by his Garments ye may be cloathed, that the ſhame of your nakedneſs do not appear; And that ye may, by being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his knowledge, be free from the wrath to come, or otherwayes ye muſt and ſhall ly under it for ever.</p>
            <p>Thus ye have the fulneſs of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on the one ſide, and the weightineſs and terribleneſs of Gods wrath on the other ſide laid before you; If ye knew what a fearful thing his wrath were, ye would be glad at your hearts to hear of a Saviour, and every one would run and make haſte to be found in him, and to ſhare of his ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to be ſure of a diſcharge by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his payment of the debt, and they would give all diligence to make ſure their Calling and Election; For that end the Lord himſelf powerfully perſwade you to do ſo.</p>

            <p>THough the news of a ſuffering Mediator ſeem to be a ſad ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, yet it hath been, is, and will be, the great Subject of the Goſpel, and of the gladeſt tidings that ever ſinners heard; This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great thing that they ought in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner to know, even <hi>Jeſus Christ and him crucified;</hi> The Prophet here takes a ſpecial delight to inſiſt on it, and in one <hi>verſe</hi> after another hath ſome new thing of his ſuffering.</p>
            <p>Having in the former <hi>verſe</hi> ſpoken to the occaſion, ground and riſe of his ſufferings, to wit, the Elects ſtraying like ſheep, their wandering and turning every one to their own way, and the Lord's laying on him the iniquity of them all; The Elect that were given to Chriſt, being naturally at enmity with God, and having run on in the courſe of their ſinful nature to the provoking God; And there being no way for them to eſcape the wrath which by their ſin they had deſerved, till the Lord found out this mids, to wit, the ſecond Perſon interpoſing as their Mediator and Surety, and ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pay their debt; On which followed the imputing of all their iniquities to him, according to the tranſaction made about them; Which tranſaction being laid down as we have heard, the Prophet proceeds to ſhew Chriſt's executing and performing of the tranſaction; And becauſe it might be thought that it was ſo great matter as could not but have much ſad and ſore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering following upon it, to take on all our iniquities; He anſwers, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all that, yet he took them on, and that very willingly and chearfully; Or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it might be thought that the former
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:152256:120"/> words look as if God had laid the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our iniquity on him, and that he had not taken it on himſelf, the Prophet tells us that it is nothing ſo, but that there was a mutual Covenant betwixt God and the Mediator, and that the Mediator was as well content to bear the iniquity of the Elect as the Father was content to lay it on him; And that though he was exacted upon, oppreſſed, afflicted, and ſuffered ſad ſtroaks, yet he rewed not the bargain, but went on reſolutely in paying the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the Elect as ſingly as ever a ſheep went to the ſlaughter, or as it is <hi>dumb before the ſhearer, ſo he opened not his mouth</hi> to ſpeak againſt it.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>three</hi> things aſſerted here that ſerve to make up the ſcope, ſuppoſing the tranſaction to have gone before, 1. The Fathers exacting the Elects debt of the Mediator. 2. The Mediators yielding and ſatisfying. 3. The manner how he did it, willingly, readily and chearfully. We ſhall firſt open the words a little, and then ſpeak to ſome Doctrines from them, reſerving the <hi>Uſes</hi> to the cloſe of all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Where it is ſaid, <hi>He was oppreſſed,</hi> the word ſignifies; to <hi>exact;</hi> And we find it three wayes applyed in Scripture, 1. To the exacting of Tribute, as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.33. Where it is ſaid, <hi>That Pharaoh Necho who put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of ſilver, and a talent of gold,</hi> it's the ſame word that is here. 2. Sometimes it's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the <hi>exacting of debts;</hi> As when a man is put to the Horn, and Caption and Impriſonment follows upon it; So <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.2. When the Lord tells his people, that <hi>the creditor ſhall not exact of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or of his brother, in the year of releaſe.</hi> 3. It's applyed to <hi>the exacting of labour,</hi> as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58 3. <hi>ye exact all your labour;</hi> And <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.11. The word <hi>Task masters</hi> comes from the ſame root; This being the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſignification of the word, it's turned here <hi>oppreſſing</hi> figuratively becauſe ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters and Task maſters in their rigorous uſage of theſe whom they exact upon, are often oppreſſive; And there being no Noun prefixed to the words in the Original, they may ſtand as well thus, <hi>It was exacted of him;</hi> That which he was ingaged to pay, he was fully exacted upon for it, to the leaſt farthing; Or take the words as they ſtand here, he was oppreſſed, that is (as we uſe to ſpeak) <hi>ſtreſſed</hi> or <hi>diſtreſſed</hi> for our debt; He was not only ingaged, but according to his ingagement was put hard to it, to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. 2. It is ſaid, <hi>He was afflicted,</hi> which is ſometimes rendered <hi>to anſwer;</hi> And theſe two agree very well together, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted upon and he anſwered the debt; As when a Bill of Exchange for ſuch a Sum is drawn upon a man, and he anſwers it; And this Expoſition runs well and ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the words following, <hi>Yet he opened not his mouth;</hi> He uſed no defence to elude or ſhift the debt: He ſaid not that it was not his, but he anſwered it indeed, and in a word ſaid nothing to the contrary; Or taking the words as here they ſtand tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, <hi>He was afflicted,</hi> they ſignifie the effect that follows on his being exacted upon; Though it brake him not, yet it brought him very low, even to an afflicted condition. The 3. thing is, that though he was brought thus low, and though it was not for his own but for other folks debt (which uſually troubles men moſt) <hi>Yet he opened not his mouth;</hi> to ſhew his wonderful condeſcendency, and the great love from which it flows; He payed the Elects debt with as good will, and as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly as if it had been his own proper and perſonal debt; Though he was the Son of God, and God equal with the Father, and might have brought Legions of Angels to deſtroy his enemies, yet <hi>as the lambs brought to the ſlaughter, and as the ſheep before the ſhearer is dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth;</hi> And it may be that there is not only here relation or reſpect had to the ſheep as it is an innocent, harmleſs, ſimple tractable creature, and not untoward and refractory as a Bull or ox uſeth to be; But alſo reſpect had to it as it was made uſe of in the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; And ſo the meaning is, he yielded his life willingly when none could take it from him, for performing the Indentor, to ſay ſo, and for ſatisfying the tranſaction paſt betwixt Jehovah and him.</p>
            <p>So, having ſhown how it comes to paſs
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:152256:121"/> that Chriſt ſuffered and ſuffered ſo much, and was brought ſo low under ſuffering; And having told that he was ingaged to pay the Elects debt, and that the Father had laid their iniquities on him; Leſt any might think that the Father would have ſpared his own Son, no, ſaith the Prophet, <hi>He was oppreſſed,</hi> and not only ſo, but <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted</hi> and humbled; And leſt it ſhould have been thought that the Lord Jehavah had better will to the bargain than the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor had; It is added, that he did ſatisfie the debt as willingly as the Father laid it on him, as theſe ſimilitudes made uſe of, plainly hold forth.</p>
            <p>Take theſe <hi>Obſervations</hi> from the words, 1. That our Lord Jeſus having entered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Surety for ſinners, he was really put at, and Juſtice exacted the debt of him which he had undertaken and engaged to pay: Read the whole ſtory of the Goſpel, and it will make out this; It's ſaid by himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. <hi>It behoved the Son of Man to ſuffer theſe things, and then to enter into his glory;</hi> He muſt needs go to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and ſuffer; And when the Cup is in his hand, and his Holy Humane Nature, having a ſinleſs ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at it, makes him pray, <hi>Father, if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, let this cup paſs from me;</hi> Yet ſeing here was a neceſſity that either he ſhould drink it, or that the Elect ſhould periſh; In the very next words, he ſweetly ſubjoyns, <hi>Not my will but thy will be done;</hi> And ſo hotly and hardly was he purſued by Juſtice, that he muſt needs come to the curſed death of the Croſs, and actually die; And as if death had gotten a piece of dominion over the Lord of Life, he is laid in the grave; So <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. the Lord ſaith, <hi>Awake, O ſword, againſt my ſhepherd, and againſt the man that is my fellow, ſmite the ſhepherd;</hi> Where we ſee, that when the good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and great Biſhop of Souls, hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for the Elects debt, Juſtice gives a Commiſſion as it were to its own holy revenge, to purſue the man that is God's fellow for that debt: That which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to confirm in the Doctrine, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that our Lord Jeſus ſuffered, but that his ſuffering was by Juſtice it's exacting of him the debt of the Elects ſin, according to the engagement that he came under to the Father; For the ſcope is to ſhew, not only that he ſuffered ſo great things as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and brought him very low; But alſo that he was put at by Juſtice in theſe ſad ſufferings, to pay the debt that he had taken on: For confirming and clearing of this a little, ye may conſider 1. The Titles which he gets in Scripture, he is called the <hi>Cautioner or Surety of the better Teſtament</hi> or Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. And by that Title he is ſhewed to be inſtated in our room, and anſwerable for our debt; And he is called the <hi>Lamb</hi> that takes away the debt of our ſin <hi>by the ſacrifice of himſelf;</hi> He ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in into our place, and kept off the ſtroak of the Sword of Juſtice that would have lighted on us, had he not interpoſed. 2. Conſider the Titles which his ſufferings and death gets, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. He is ſaid to <hi>purchaſe</hi> (to wit by it) <hi>eternal Redemption for us;</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. we are ſaid to be <hi>juſtified through the Redemption that is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> We were ſlaves to the Devil, ſubject to the curſe, diſcerned and adjudged to ſuffer for the wrongs that we had done to Juſtice; And his ſuffering is called <hi>Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> becauſe as the man that redeems the Captive, gives a ranſom for him, ſo he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed and payed a ranſom for us; It's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo called a <hi>propitiation,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> to wit, pleaſing to God, and accepted of him in the room of all the Elect; And this word <hi>propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> as it ſuppoſeth God's being diſpleaſed with the Elect before Chriſt's ſatisfaction, ſo it plainly holds forth his being well pleaſed with them on the account of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. 3. Conſider theſe Scriptures that ſpeak not only of Chriſt's ſufferings, but of their end and ſcope, even the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him down (to ſpeak ſo) into the Elects room, as <hi>v.</hi> 5. of this Chapter, <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions,</hi> &amp;c. He got the ſtroaks, and we got the cure, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He was made ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God through him;</hi> We are ſinners, and Chriſt is to purchaſe righteouſneſs to us; And the way how he doth it, is by ſteping in into our room, and becoming our Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:152256:121"/> and he ingaging as Surety, the Law wins at him on that ground; ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>He hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law by being made a curſe for us;</hi> we were under the Curſe and lyable to be purſued by it, and our Lord Jeſus becomes a Curſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from it: Conſidering then the end of Gods Covenant, which is to glorify his Juſtice a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Grace, that Sinners may know it is an evil thing to ſin and depart from God, and that Grace is a very coſtly thing, whereunto he hath made acceſs through the Vail, which is his Fleſh; and conſidering Chriſts undertaking, without which they could not be ſet free, it could not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. This is a truth that hath in it much of the marrow of the Goſpel, and tends much to humble us, and is alſo very much for our comfort: What was Juſtice ſeeking of Chriſt when he ſuffered and was in an agony? if thou beeſt a Believer or an elect Sinner, it was even exacting thy Debt of him; and would it not affect an ingenuous Debtor to ſee his Cautioner dragged haled, and hurried to Priſon for his Debt? Even ſo, if we could look on Chriſts Sufferings as ſo many Summons and Purſevants arreſting him for our Debt, it could not but affect us with much ſorrow for our ſins that brought him to this, and with much love to him who was content to be ſo dealt with for them; and no doubt this is one of the reaſons why <hi>he will have his death remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered till he come again,</hi> even that we may ſee our obligation to him, and be ſuitably affected with it.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That the Debt of the Elects ſins was ſeverely and with holy rigidity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of Chriſt to the very full worth or value; this proceeding was as to Chriſt by way of Juſtice, whether we look to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe that he made, to wit, the Elects Souls, he laid down as good in their room, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we look to a Tranſaction or Bargain going before, whatever was in the ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he payed and ſatisfied to the full, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was remitted nor given him down; or whether we look to the Curſe due to the Elect, that was inflicted on him, and he himſelf was made a Curſe for us, looking on the Curſe ſimply as penal and what was bitter in it, which ſhews his condeſcendency in his Sufferings ſo much the more.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That our Lord Jeſus was brought exceeding low while the Debt of the Elect was exacted of him; He was put to exceeding ſore affliction, much ſtraitned and ſtreſſed by the Juſtice of God exacting of him the Debt due by elect Sinners. We ſpoke to ſome words before, which bare out this, as <hi>he was wounded, bruiſed, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,</hi> &amp;c. and now we ſee the effect here when Juſtice puts him to it; After he hath taken on the Debt, he is tried, ſtripped as it were to the ſkin, puniſhed and diſtreſſed ere he get it payed; If we conſider our Lord Jeſus as God, he is neither leſs nor more puniſhed, being ſo conſidered, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incapable of any ſuch thing; But if we look on him as Mediator, God-man, God much withdrawing from him the influence of his comforting preſence while he hath the cup of wrath in his hand, ſo, he is brought exceeding low and ſadly afflicted; And theſe <hi>four</hi> conſiderations (under which we may ſee him paying our Debt) may clear it, 1. That he laid aſide the glory which before the World was he had with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for a time; which therefore that it may be reſtored to him again, he prayeth <hi>John</hi> 17.5. it having been as to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation thereof in his perſon eclipſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, and darkened for a ſeaſon; hence the Apoſtle ſays <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. that <hi>he emptied himſelf and became of no reputation,</hi> as if his glory had not been diſcernable for a time; He that is Judge of Quick and Dead is himſelf judged; He that created Heaven and Earth, hath not whereon to lay his head; Though all the kings of the Earth hold their Treaſures of him, yet he was ſo poor that he lives upon the alms of others, for <hi>women miniſtred unto him.</hi> 2. Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath he a Being that is mean and low, but he is exceedingly afflicted, he ſuffered hunger; he is purſued as if he had been a thief or a robber; a band of men comes and apprehends him in the night as if he had been a Malefactor or Evil-doer, and drags him away to the civil Judge; his back is ſmitten, his face is ſpitted on, his head ratted and pricked with thorns, ſentence is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:152256:122"/> paſſed upon him, he is condemned and ſcourged; and when he dow not bear his own croſs, (his body, being a true humane body, is ſo fainted and infeebl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f; and not only ſo, but he muſt come to death, and to the ſhameful and curſed death of the Croſs; and he dies very quickly, further to point out his lowneſs, which was ſuch that death over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him ſooner than the others, becauſe he had other things to wreſtle with. 3. In his name he ſuffered, he was rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oached, nodded at with the head, reviled, mocked, ſent about as a ſpectacle from <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> back again from <hi>Herod</hi> to <hi>Pilate;</hi> He had a ſcarlet rob put on him in deriſion; the high Prieſts alſo deride him; the <hi>Jews</hi> wag the head at him, and count him not at all worthy to live, and therefore prefer a Robber and Murderer to him. 4. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his inward ſufferings, O! theſe were far more piercing; Juſtice laid claim to his ſoul, <hi>the ſorrows of hell compaſſed him; his ſoul is heavy unto the death; he ſweats blood,</hi> and crys <hi>if it be poſſible that that</hi> wrathful <hi>cup might paſs from him;</hi> and on the Croſs with a pitiful voice, <hi>my God, my God why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> which, by the way, is not an expreſſion of any quarrelling com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint or diſcouragement, but of ſinleſs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture when he is arraigned and made to ſtand before the Tribunal of God, affected with the horrour of divine Wrath, and cannot eaſily endure that there ſhould be a Cloud betwixt God and him: But theſe Soul-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his, will fall in to be ſpoken to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; only we ſee here that he was afflicted, and in ſuffering was greatly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and brought very low: And indeed conſidering that all the Elects ſins were laid upon him, and that Juſtice was exacting all their Debt of him, he could not be otherways, but behoved to be exceedingly afflicted and ſore diſtreſſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That foraſmuch as our Lord ſuffered, yet he did moſt willingly and chearfully undergo it all; He thwarted not with it; he repented not, he grudged not, he flinſhed not nor drew aback; or, which is to the ſame purpoſe, our Lord Jeſus in his loweſt humiliation and affliction, and all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, 1. In his undertaking of the Bargain, his willingneſs appears, when burnt Offerings and Sacrifices would not do it, and when there was no obligation on him to do what he did, then comes in his free offer and conſent, and that with delight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>Then ſaid I, Lo, I come: in the volum of thy book, it's written of me, I delight to do thy will O my God;</hi> where we ſee that there was no extorting or throwing of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Mediator againſt his will, but a delightſome offering of it; and that word of his <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. is very remarkable to this purpoſe, <hi>Rejoycing in the habitable parts of the earth, and my delight was with the ſons of men;</hi> The contemplation and foreſight of his Incarnation and Suffering for the Elect was (to ſpeak ſo) refreſhing to him, and made him leap as it were for joy, ere the World was made, and before they had a Being. 2. Conſider the great things that he undertook, not only to be Man, but a poor mean man; It had been much for him to have humbled himſelf to be Monarch of the whole World, as his <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>prophane</hi> pretended <hi>Vicar</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> claims to be; yet he not only will not be ſo, but <hi>emptied himſelf</hi> and became <hi>a worm</hi> in a manner, <hi>and no man, an out-caſt of the people,</hi> O ſuch a proof of his love; And when he took the Cup, that bitter Cup, and ſaid, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me,</hi> leſt it ſhould ſeem a thwarting with the work of Redemption, and with his Fathers will therein; He ſays, let it come Father,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:152256:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>

Conſider the manner of his Suffering, and we will ſee a further proof of his willingneſs; How little pains takes he to eſcape them, yea, when <hi>Peter</hi> labours to diſwade him <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. from ſuffering, he diſdains and rejects the ſuggeſtion with a ſevere check, <hi>Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me Sathan, thou art an offence unto me, thou ſavourest not the things that be of God but of men;</hi> and when his Diſciples ſaid to him (reſolving to go up again to <hi>Judea) John</hi> 11.8. <hi>Maſter, the Jews of late ſought to ſtone thee, and wilt thou go thither again;</hi> He will needs go up notwithſtanding; and when they were going up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Mark 10 32. <hi>He went before</hi> all the reſt, to wit at a ſwift pace; and <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.50. he ſays, <hi>I have a baptiſm to be baptized with, and how am I ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed?</hi> Never did men long ſo much for their Marriage-day, and for the day of their triumph, as our Lord Jeſus did to get the Elects Debt payed and their Diſcharge extracted and drawen out. 4. Conſider his eaſineſs and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be taken; He goes forth <hi>John</hi> 18. to meet the band of Souldiers that came with the Traitor to apprehend him, and aſks them again and again, <hi>whom ſeek ye,</hi> and ſays as often, <hi>I am he;</hi> he will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his Diſciples to draw a ſword in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. but when <hi>Peter</hi> drew his ſword, he bade him <hi>put it up again,</hi> for he could have <hi>commanded more then twelve le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of angels;</hi> but it behoveth him now to ſuffer, he came for another end than to oppoſe his ſufferings; and hence he ſays <hi>John</hi> 10. <hi>No man takes my life from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf, and I have power to take it up again;</hi> it was neither <hi>Judas</hi> nor <hi>Pilate</hi> that took his life againſt his will, but he willing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To the Fathers ſatisfaction, for his willing ſuffering is that which makes it a Sacrifice acceptable and well-pleaſing to him. 2.

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Wonder Believers at the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs and infinitneſs of the Grace of God, and at the heart-affecting and ſoul-raviſhing love of the Mediator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at Grace in God that ſpared the Debtor and exacted payment from the Cautioner the Son of his love; at love in the Mediator that payed ſo much, and ſo willingly and cheerfully: If any ſubject of thoughts be pertinent for us while we are about to celebrate the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, certainly this were perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; concerning a crucified Chriſt in ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in our room to pay our Debt, and doing this of his own accord, without the ſolicitation or interpoſing of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and doing it withall ſo frankly and cheerfully: Was ever the like of this love heard tell of, for one, and more eſpecially for ſuch a one, to ſuffer ſo much and ſo cheerfully unrequired? we would have you confirmed in the Faith of this great and ſweet Truth, that he had never better will, nay never ſo good will to eat his Dinner, then, and as, he had to ſuffer and ſatisfie Juſtice for you, though at a dear rate; He ſays <hi>John</hi> 4. <hi>It was his meat to do the fathers will that ſent him, and to finiſh his work;</hi> Have ye ſuitable thoughts of his love when ye read the Goſpel? have ye in the Word ſeen him ſtanding before <hi>Pilate</hi> in your room, not anſwering when he is accuſed, and <hi>Pilate</hi> marvelling at his ſilence? and did <hi>Pilate</hi> marvel, knowing and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his innocency? and have ye ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver marvelled, or marvelled but very little? ſure, your little marvelling at his ſilence is the more ſadly marvellous, that the cauſe of his ſilence when he was charged with your iniquities, with ſuch and ſuch a piece of your miſcarriage, with ſuch a vain and roaving heart, with ſuch a wanton look, with ſuch a profane or idle word of yours, with the horrid ſin of your having ſo abuſed, ſlighted and neglected him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the cauſe, I ſay, of his ſilence at ſuch a terrible accuſation and charge, and not vindicating of himſelf, or ſaying, theſe faults, miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and tranſgreſſions are not mine, as he might have done; was pure love to you, O! is not this ſtrange? and yet moſt true; wonder then more at it.</p>

Here is ſtrong conſolation to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and wonderful wiſdom in the riſe and convey of it, in uniting Juſtice and Love; out of which the conſolation ſprings; Juſtice exacting upon and diſtreſſing the Son of God, and he ſatisfying Juſtice ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that though all the Elect had ſatisfied eternally in Hell, it had not been made to ſhine ſo ſplendidly and gloriouſly; Juſtice alſo on the Mediators ſide in yielding and giving ſatisfaction though it ſhould oppreſs and break Soul and Body: And yet love, both on the Father and Mediators ſide; on the Fathers ſide, love, in finding out this way of ſatisfaction to his own Juſtice, when there was no cure but by wounding of his own Son, and yet he was content rather to wound him, than that the Elect ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and be wounded eternally; and love on the Mediators ſide, who willingly yields and undergoes their Debt, and will not hide his face from ſhame and ſpitting; what may not the Believer expect from God when he ſpared not his own Son for him? and what may he expect from Chriſt who ſpared not himſelf for his ſake? and who is that good Shepherd that laid down his life for the Sheep, and held his tongue and quarrelled not with thoſe that ſmote him, will he quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with a poor Sinner coming to him and pleading for the benefite of ſatisfaction? no certainly; but as the word is <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>He will reſt in his love,</hi> or as the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, <hi>He will be ſilent or dumb in his love;</hi> he will not upbraid thee nor caſt up thy former miſcarriages, he will not ſay reproachfully to thee, where waſt thou ſo long playing the Prodigal? he is better content with thy recovery than ever he was diſcontent or ill-pleaſed with all the wrong thou didſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>

            <p>WE need not tell you of whom the Prophet is ſpeaking here, every <hi>verſe</hi> and every word almoſt do make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that he ſpeaks of Chriſt the Saviour, and indeed it can be applyed to none other; It's the ſame <hi>verſe, Acts</hi> 8.34. from which <hi>Philip</hi> proceeds to preach Chriſt to the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch:</hi> The Prophet hath been largely hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth Chriſt's ſufferings in the former <hi>verſe,</hi> and we conceive he takes a turn to ſpeak of Chriſt's exaltation and out gate from theſe ſufferings; It's true (as if he had ſaid) <hi>He was brought to Priſon and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> He was indeed ſtraitned, and pinched, and laid very low, but Priſon and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did not keep him; <hi>He was taken,</hi> or as the word is, <hi>He was lift up,</hi> from both; And for as deſpicable as he was in man's eyes, yet he was not ſo in himſelf, for <hi>who ſhall declare his generation?</hi> There is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfulneſs in him who ſuffered, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reached, but muſt be left with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; And a wonderfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> glory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he was after his humiliation exalted; and there is a reaſon of this given for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of offence; if any ſhould ſay, how then could he ſuffer and be brought ſo low in ſuffering, if he was ſo glorious a perſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>? He anſwers, it is true that <hi>he was cut off out of the land of the living,,</hi> but for no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in himſelf, but for the tranſgreſſion of Gods Elect <hi>was he ſtricken,</hi> or as the word is, <hi>The ſtroak was upon him;</hi> Yea this (as we conceive) is given as a reaſon of his exaltation. Becauſe in the loweſt ſteps of his humiliation he condeſcended to fulfil his ingagement to the Father, in ſatisfying Juſtice for the ſins of the Elect, according to that of <hi>John</hi> 10.17. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life that I might take it again;</hi> Becauſe according to his ingagement he ſuffered for the ſins of his Elect People, therefore he could not but have a comfortable and glorious out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</p>
            <p>There are theſe <hi>three</hi> things in the words, 1. Somewhat aſſerted concerning Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>He was taken from Priſon and from Judgement.</hi> 2. Something hinted at which cannot be expreſſed, <hi>Who ſhall declare his generation?</hi> 3. There is a reaſon given in reference to both, <hi>For he was cut off,</hi> &amp;c. which we ſhall expound when we come to it.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>He was taken from Priſon and from Judgement;</hi> We conceive theſe words look both to his humiliation and to his out-gate from it, the one being clearly ſuppoſed, that he was in priſon or ſtraits, and brought to judgement, and the other being expreſſed, that he was brought from priſon and from judgement: 1. <hi>Priſon</hi> here may be taken generally for any ſtrait pinch or preſſour tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> one may be brought unto, which we conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve both the Words and the Prophets ſcope will clear; Chriſt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:152256:124"/> never having been properly in priſon, at leaſt for any conſiderable time, but ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and pinched; And he was taken from that, being in his humiliation, and in his ſufferings in the room of the Elect purſued by the Law and Juſtice of God, 2. <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is taken paſſively for Judgement paſt on him, and it looks not only to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedour of <hi>Pilate,</hi> of the Chief Prieſt, and of the Scribes and Phariſees, but to a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Proceſs which the Juſtice of God led againſt him, in which reſpect he anſwered (as the words after will clear) for the ſins of God's people. 3. The word, <hi>He was eaken,</hi> ſometimes ſignifies to deliver, as a Captive is delivered when he is taken from him that took him Captive, as it is, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.24. <hi>Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?</hi> To which the Lord here anſwers, <hi>It,</hi> or <hi>he</hi> ſhall <hi>be taken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, the ſcope and meaning of the words is, that the Prophet ſubjoyns a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſt's Exaltation upon the back of his Humiliation, as it is uſual in the Scripture to put theſe together, and in this order, as namely, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>He bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even to the death of the croſs; Wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name,</hi> &amp;c. He was exceedingly ſtraitned and pinched for the Elects ſins, but death had no dominion over him, he had a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious out-gate; He was taken out and ſet free from the priſon or ſtraits wherein he was held, And from theſe judgements that paſt upon him; The reaſon of the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is drawn from the plain meaning of the words, which muſt run thus, <hi>He was taken from judgement,</hi> the very ſame which is in the following expreſſion, <hi>He was cut off out of the land of the living,</hi> that being the ordinary ſignification of the prepoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>from,</hi> the meaning muſt be this, that he was taken out of the condition wherein he was; It agrees alſo beſt with the ſcope of the very next words, <hi>Who ſhall declare his generation?</hi> Wherein he propoſeth an admirable aggravation of this delivery.</p>
            <p>The 2d. thing hath a connexion with the former, and therefore take a word or two for clearing of it; What to underſtand by <hi>Generation</hi> here, is ſomewhat difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, the word in the Original having ſeveral meanings, yet generally it looks to one of two, as it is applyed to Chriſt, 1. Either to the time paſt, and ſo it's uſed by many to expreſs and hold forth Chriſt's God-head, and ſo the meaning is, though he was brought very low, yet he was and is the eternal Son of God: Or 2. (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is taken) it looks to the time to come, and ſo the meaning is, who ſhall declare his duration or continuance? <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> is often taken thus in Scripture for the continuance of an Age, and of one Age following another ſucceſſively, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> 22. <hi>This Altar ſhall be a witneſs to the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to come;</hi> So then, the meaning is, he was once low, but God exalted him, and brought him thorow, and who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this duration or continuance of his exaltation? As it is <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>He hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore God highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him;</hi> As his humiliation was low, ſo his exaltation was ineffable, it cannot be declared nor adequatly conceived, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it being for ever; There is no inconſiſtency betwixt theſe two Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; His duration or continuance after his ſuffering neceſſarily preſuppoſing his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, brought in here partly to ſhew the wonderfulneſs of his ſuffering, it being God that ſuffered, for the man that ſuffered was God; Partly to ſhew Chriſt's glory, who notwithſtanding of his ſuffering was brought thorow and gloriouſly exalted: And theſe reaſons make it evident, 1. Whatever theſe words, <hi>Who ſhall declare his age or generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> do ſignifie, certainly it is ſomething that can be ſpoken of no other, but of Chriſt, and that agrees to him ſo as it agrees to no other; Now if we look ſimply to the <hi>eternity</hi> of his duration or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that agrees to all the Elect, and will agree to all men at the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Therefore the Prophet muſt look here to his continuance and duration as he is God. 2. Becauſe, <hi>Who ſhall declare his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naration?</hi> is brought in here, to ſhew the ineffableneſs of it, and ſo to make his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings the more wonderful, it was he who ſuffered, whoſe continuance cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:152256:125" rendition="simple:additions"/> 3. It's ſuch a continuance as is brought in to ſhew a reaſon why death could not have dominion over him, nor keep him, according to that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the ſpirit of holineſs by his reſurrection from the dead;</hi> And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſubjoyned to this will ſomeway clear it, for <hi>he was cut off out of the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſtricken;</hi> Thereby inſinuating, that becauſe of the great work which he had to do, there behoved to be ſome ſingularneſs in the perſon that had the work in hand, who notwithſtanding of the greatneſs and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultneſs of it, came thorow, and was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by exalted: However it be, the Prophets ſcope being to ſet out Chriſt's Humiliation and Exaltation, his Humiliation before, and his Exaltation after, which is, as we ſaid, ordinary in Scripture; We conceive the meaning we have given is ſafe, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Prophets ſcope.</p>
            <p>We may <hi>obſerve three</hi> things from the firſt part of the words, 1. That our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in his performing the work of Redemption was exceedingly ſtraitned or pinſhed, or <hi>held in,</hi> as the word is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where rendered, bound up and hemmed in as men are who are in Priſon; and by theſe ſtraitnings we mean not only ſuch as he was brought into by, and before men, (whereof we ſpoke before;) but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe that were more inward; and theſe being amongſt the laſt ſteps of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, more immediately preceeding his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, and ſpoken of as moſt wonderful, we conceive they look to theſe preſſures that were upon his ſpirit; and we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſeveral places of Scripture that ſerve to hold them out; the firſt is that of <hi>John</hi> 12.27, 28. <hi>Now is my ſoul troubled, and what ſhall I ſay? Father, ſave me from this hour;</hi> here our bleſſed Lord is troubled in Spirit, and ſo pinſhed and hedged in as in a Priſon, that he is holily non-pluſſed what to ſay. The 2d Scripture is <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.38. <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful even unto death,</hi> which is like the expreſſions uſed by the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.8. <hi>We were preſſed above meaſure, above ſtrength, in ſo much as we deſpaired of life, and we had the ſentence of death in our ſelves;</hi> there was no outgate obvious to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſenſe and uptaking; ſo is it here; wherein we are not only to conſider his Soul vexation, but that his Soul vexation was very great, extreamly pinſhing, vexing, and in a manner impriſoning to him. The 3d Scripture is <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. <hi>He being in an agony prayed more earnestly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground;</hi> there was ſuch a ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wreſtling and conflicting, not with man without him, but with inward preſſures on his ſpirit, that he is like one in a Barrace, or Cockpit, or engaged in a Duel with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Combatant, ſore put to it, very far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ought that we can conceive of; ſo that <hi>he ſwat great drops of blood,</hi> and ſays, <hi>father if thou be willing remove this cup from me, nevertheleſs, not my will but thine be done;</hi> it is in <hi>Matthew, if it be poſſible,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after <hi>if it be not poſſible;</hi> which ſays, there was no winning out of the grips of the Law and Juſtice till they were fully ſatisfied; and theſe dreadful words uttered by him on the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> hold out that from the ſinleſs humane nature of Chriſt, the comfortable and joyful influence of the God-head for a time was in a great meaſure ſuſpended, (though the ſuſtaining power thereof was exerciſed mightily on him) ſo that he looks on himſelf ſome way as forſaken and left in the hand of the Curſe.</p>
            <p>To clear this a little, we would conſider theſe preſſures that were on our Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. 1. In reſpect of their <hi>cauſe.</hi> 2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their <hi>effects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of their cauſe; There is upon the one ſide his undertaking for the Elect as their Surety, and Gods Juſtice pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing and holding him in on the other ſide, ſo that he cannot decline being ſiſted at the Bar of Juſtice, becauſe as it is <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. the ſins of all the Elect met upon him; and he having as it is <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. the bitter cup in his hand which by his engagement he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to drink, he ſtands there by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God and by the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption tying him to ſatisfie; and being purſued by Wrath and Juſtice, the words
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:152256:125" rendition="simple:additions"/> come out, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup depart from me, yet not my will but thine be done;</hi> his engagement hemming him in, and wrath purſuing him, he ſtands betwixt theſe two as a priſoner; and upon theſe two <hi>the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all,</hi> and <hi>he was exacted upon and anſwered for them;</hi> follows well the third, <hi>that he was put in priſon;</hi> for in theſe Verſes, the ſteps of our Lords Humiliation are followed out in a legal way as before the bar of Gods Tribunal.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. This being our Lords poſture, we ſhall conſider the <hi>effects</hi> of this preſſure of ſpirit, which we may draw to theſe <hi>four</hi> heads. 1. He was under the ſenſe of great Soul-pain, ſorrow and trouble; for the cup of the wrath of God being bitter which he was to drink, it could not but deeply ſting his holy humane nature, which was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cauſe of his <hi>agony,</hi> and that which made his ſoul ſorrowful and brought out the <hi>bloody ſweat.</hi> 2. Beſide his grief and dolour, there was a holy horrour; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the party that he had to do with, it was impoſſible it could be otherways, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a finit though a ſinleſs creature, to look on an angry God, and on wrath poured forth into the cup which it muſt needs drink, and not to have a horrour at it; it were not becoming the ſinleſs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of our bleſſed Lord not to be affected with a holy and ſinleſs horrour at that moſt bitter cup, which brought out that ſad cry, <hi>Father, let this cup depart from me;</hi> which did not proceed from any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like he had to fulfil his engagement, or from any rewing or unſuitable reſentment that he had ſo engaged himſelf, but from an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended ſinleſs diſproportionableneſs (to ſpeak ſo) in his finit ſinleſs humane nature, to encounter with the wrath of his Father; to which, though he moſt willingly yielded, yet in it ſelf it was dreadful. 3. There was a pinſhing and ſtraitning of holy fear, as if there had been in him a ſinleſs diſpute or debate, <hi>what will become of this? can a man win thorow this?</hi> (though he was God as well as man) <hi>how will this be gotten born? This looks as if death would get the victory;</hi> Thus it's ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>In the days of his fleſh he offtred up ſtrong crys and ſupplications with tears, and was heard in that which he feared,</hi> he put up ſtrong crys to be delivered, not from dying, but from the power of death, <hi>and was heard in that which he feared,</hi> to ſhew a holy care to prevent death, could that have been, and a ſinleſs fear of it leſt it ſhould ſwallow him up. 4. There was a pinſhing and ſtraitning from love to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and to the doing of his Will; and from love to the Elect and to their Salvation, which puſhed him forward to perform and fulfil his engagement; accordingly <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.41. he ſays, <hi>I have a baptizm to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with, and how am I ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed,</hi> and hence it was that theſe words were uttered by him, <hi>Father, not my will but thine be done;</hi> and therefore though he had power to command twelve legions of Angels for his relief, yet, to ſpeak ſo, love binds his hands that he will not uſe his power for his own liberation. But to guard this Doctrine from miſtakes, take a <hi>fourfold</hi> advertiſement concerning this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſoul-pinſhing, which will help to clear ſomewhat of his Soul-ſuffering that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, And. 1. Think not that there was any ſinful or unſuitable confuſion or perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind in our Lord, ſuch as uſeth to be in us, there being no dreg of corruption in his mind to jumble or diſcompoſe his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humane nature. 2. Beware of thinking that there was any fretting or anxiety in him, or any diſcontentedneſs with the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, his expreſſions ſhew forth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for (ſaith he) <hi>I could command twelve legions of angels,</hi> yet he would not do it. 3. Think not that there was any jealouſie in him of the Fathers love, though there was a ſuſpenſion of the comfortable and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe of it, yet there was not the leaſt louſing of the faith of it, as is clear by his doubling of theſe words, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> when in his ſaddeſt pinſh he cried out as b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forſaken. 4. Ye would not look on this as holding out any diſtruſt as to the event. <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it up again;</hi> and <hi>I will riſe again the third day;</hi> he knew that the Covenant of Redemption betwixt the Father and him ſtood firm and ſure:
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:152256:126"/> But it's the conſideration of God's now coming as his Party to exact the Elects Debt of him, and his ſtanding at the Bar to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for it, which puts him in this agony; and though conſidering Chriſt as man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally united to the God-head (whereby he was keeped from ſinking,) he had no diſtruſt to be carried thorow; yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering him as Man ſuffering, and that (to ſpeak ſo with reverence in ſuch a divine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) there was an eclipſe of that ſenſible joy that proceeded from the two natures together, It's not poſſible to conceive of Chriſt in this poſture, but wrath and anger behoved to be ſome-way dreadful or terrible to him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> are, 1. To evidence the truth of what our Lord ſuffered, and how ſeverely he was pinſhed and ſtraitned; It was not the Scribes and Phariſees purſuing him, nor the Souldiers buffeting and mocking of him, and carrying him to the high Prieſt's hall, and from <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Herod</hi> and back again, that ſo much troubled him; but there was a higher H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd that he had to look to, and a Judge and Court to which he was now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, that was very far above theirs.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as a 2d. <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Think it not ſuch a light thing (as many do) to ſatisfie Juſtice, or to give God a ranſom for Souls, ye ſee how it pinſhed the Cautioner, and put him as in a priſon; unſpeakably deceived are they who think that two or three formal words will make their peace with God, and that they will ſlip in to Heaven ſo; Be not carried away with this deluſion, but conſider ſeriouſly what will become of you if ye be put to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for your own Debt, when he handled the Cautioner his own Son ſo roughly; ye that will ſleep on, and ſcorn to let any word pick at you or prick you, the Juſtice of God ſhall prick you and put you to ſtraits, out of which ye will not be able to extricate your ſelves; and he ſhall appear like <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting burning when the great day of his wrath comes,</hi> and when it ſhall be ſaid by you, <hi>who can stand before it,</hi> or abide it? It were good that ye who are moſt atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and who with a ſort of triumph and gallantry will needs deſtroy your ſelves, would lay this to heart, and remember that the day comes when ye will be brought to this Bar; and gravely conſider what a Hell that will be, to have the deſperateneſs of the outgate ſealed up in your Conſciences; and theſe evidences of Gods hatred, and theſe aggravations that our Lords holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could not admit of, in your boſome; when Wrath meets with Corruption, and Corruption with Wrath, and when theſe mingle, how dreadful will your caſe be?</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. Let Believers ſee here what ye are obliged to Chriſt; Conſider what he hath payed, and what the ſatisfaction of Juſtice for you coſt him; Folks are ready to think that it was an eaſie thing to ſatisfie Juſtice, and <hi>to drink of the brook by the way;</hi> but if Sinners were ſenſible of challanges for ſin, and if they had the Arrows of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty drinking up their ſpirits, they would think otherwiſe of Chriſts drinking out the cup of Wrath for them, not leaving ſo much as one drop of it; It's but the ſhorings or threatnings with ſome drops of it that any of you meet with in your ſharpeſt Soul-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes; O! believing Sinners, are ye not then eternally obliged to Chriſt who drunk out this wrathful-cup for you?</p>
            <p n="4">4ly. There is notable conſolation here to poor Souls that would fain make uſe of Chriſt, As 1. That Chriſt hath ſtepped thorow this deep Foord, or rather Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; and if the Cup come in their hand, it's empty; Freedom from the Wrath of God is a great conſolation, and yet it's the conſolation of all them that are fled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for refuge. 2. It's comfortable to them in their comparatively petty ſtraits and difficulties when they wot not what to do, when the Law ſeizeth and Juſtice pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth, and when the Conſcience challengeth; to conſider that Chriſt was a priſoner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, though he had no challenge for his own debt, yet he was challenged for ours, that he might be a compaſſionate high Prieſt, being made like to us, but without ſin; Juſtice purſued him, the Law arreſted him, wrath ſeized on him; ſo that when we are ſet upon by theſe he will be tender of us, for he knows our frame and that we cannot bear much; and therefore on this
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:152256:126"/> ground a believing ſinner may go with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Throne of Grace, becauſe Chriſt the Cautioner who hath payed his Debt, is there; it's a ſhame for believing ſinners to walk ſo heartleſly, even under theſe things that are terrible, as if Chriſt had not gone thorow them before them and for them. 3. There is conſolation here when they are under any pinſhing croſs and difficulty; as there is alſo ground for patient and pleaſant bearing of it, becauſe it was another ſort of priſon that Chriſt was put in for them; ye may I grant lament over the long want of ſenſible preſence, it being kindly to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to miſs it, and to long for it, but ye ſhould not be heartleſs under the want of it, nor complain as the Lords people do <hi>lament, Is there any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow?</hi> but ſubmiſſively and contentedly bear it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fretting, ſeing our Lord bare ſo much for you.</p>
            <p n="5">5ly. There is here a notable encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to believe, and a notable ground for the Believer to expect freedom from ſin and from the pinſhing ſtraits that it deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, becauſe Chriſt payed dear for it; wherefore was all this pinſhing but to pay Believers Debt? But when we come to ſpeak of his outgate, it will clear this more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. While it's ſaid, That <hi>he was brought from judgment,</hi> which ſuppoſes and implyes, that he was once at, or under judgment, even the judgment of God, who is his great party all along; <hi>He laid on him the iniquity of us all;</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him;</hi> He was the Creditor that cauſed take and arreſt him; <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That in all the Soul-vexation, in all the pinſhing preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſpirit that our Lord ſuſtained, he was ſtanding judicially before the bar of God, and was judicially proceeded againſt as the Elects Cautioner and Surety; there was no acceſs to bring Chriſt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>udgment had he not engaged to be Surety, and had not God laid on him our iniquities, for it was for no Debt that he was owing himſelf, but for what by his engagement as the Elects Surety he came under and was made lyable to: That which I mean by his being brought to Judgment, is not only that he ſuffered &amp; was occaſionally condemned by a Court of men, or by a humane Judicatory, which was rather like a tumultuary Meeting, or a company of men in an uproar, than indeed a Court; but whatever was before men, there was a legal and judicial procedure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: For clearing whereof, ye would conſider, 1. The account whereon he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and was brought before Gods Court of Judgment, to ſpeak ſo; It was not for any thing that the <hi>Scribes</hi> or <hi>Phariſees,</hi> or <hi>Pilate</hi> had to lay to his charge; it was envy in them, the former at leaſt, that ſtirred them in what they did; but the next words tell us what it was, <hi>for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſtriken;</hi> The Prieſts and People had no mind of this, but this was indeed the ground of his judicial Challenge and Arraignment before God; the Elect were in their ſins, and he by the Covenant of Redemption ſtood lyable for their Debt, becauſe in it he had undertaken for them as their Cautioner and Surety. 2. Conſider who was his great party in his Sufferings; it was not <hi>Pilate</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> he cared not ſo much for them, but it is God, and therefore he crys, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> and therefore he makes his addreſs to God, <hi>Father if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible let this cup paſs from me;</hi> he cared not for anſwering them, but looks to a higher hand, and upon himſelf as ſtanding before another Tribunal; therefore it's ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him;</hi> he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to <hi>Pilate</hi> but to the Lord purſuing him. 3.

               </gap>ther and let us compt; he looks not only to the preſent diſpenſation, but alſo to the ground whence it came, and to the end that God had in it; <hi>for this cauſe came I unto this hour,</hi> even to have my ſoul troubled, and to be put to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the D bt of my elect People ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Engagement; <hi>Lo, I come</hi> (ſaith he, in that often cited 40. <hi>Pſalm) in the volum of thy book, it is wretten of me, I delight do thy will.</hi> Conſider 4ly. The effects of his bringing to Judgment; A ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:152256:127"/> paſſes 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. Great is the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of godlineſs, God manifested in the fleſh, justified in the ſpirit,</hi> not before <hi>Pilate,</hi> but in Gods Court, having ſatisfied for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects Debt according to his undertaking, he gets an abſolviture, which reaches not only to himſelf but to all them whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he ſuſtained, as is clear 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. He was made ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> and the Elects obtaining eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Abſolution by his death, with the accreſcing of his ſatisfaction to their juſtification, clears that he ſtood there judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the Bar of God in their name to anſwer for them. And there are <hi>three</hi> ſteps of this his judicial anſwering, 1. He gets the Libel of the Elects Debt put in his hand; though <hi>there was no guile in his mouth, yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he laid on him the iniquity of us all,</hi> and <hi>for the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my people was he ſtricken;</hi> theſe are the perſons that he undertook for, and for their Debt he anſwers; the verity of the fact is clear, for they are under guilt; the Laws claim is clear, for it's broken, and upon this the Libel is put in his hand; hence it's ſaid, <hi>He died for us, He was made ſin for us,</hi> and <hi>he died for our ſins.</hi> 2. As the Libel is put in his hand, ſo a ſentence paſſes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, he is found lyable to the Elects Debt and muſt anſwer for it, as the former word is, <hi>it was exacted on him,</hi> and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. He was made ſin for us,</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13: <hi>He was made a curſe for us,</hi> that is, by the ſentence of Juſtice he is decerned to bear the curſe. 3. The ſentence is executed as it was paſt, the cup is put in his hand, and not only is he decerned and doomed to the curſe, but actually he is made a curſe, and all this as judicially ſuſtaining the perſons of the Elect, and as their Cautioner and Surety.</p>
            <p>Here we have ſome ſweet and profitable <hi>Uſes,</hi> 1. See here and take up the way of Redemption contrived, ſo as it runs on Mercy and Juſtice, Mercy to the Elect, and Juſtice to the Cautioner, their Debt being fully exacted of him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It learns us how to eſtabliſh our Faith, and alſo gives us a ground of Believing; To make it diſtinct; Juſtice behoved to be ſatisfied, without which no Mercy could be ſhewed to the Sinner; and God hath laid down the way by the Cautioners interpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; even as it is among men, the Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners being impriſoned and ſatisfying, is the Debtors liberation; and as God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to deal with us by way of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſo he condeſcended in the Covenant of Redemption to proceed legally and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially with Chriſt, that we might have the clearer way to make application of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Are there any here that look for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption thorow Chriſt, and hope that their ſins were in the Libel given to him? O! how warming would this be to your hearts? and how ſhould it make them to melt in love and godly ſorrow, to behold Chriſt ſtanding at Juſtice-bar, and that for you? O! what an aſpect would his ſufferings have on us if we were clear about our intereſt in him, and could hear him in our name, ſaying, <hi>Father here am I, if thou take me let theſe go; thy will be done, for this cauſe came I here to anſwer for my peoples debt, to take with the challenges given in against them, and to undergo thy ſentence for them;</hi> then ſays Juſtice, <hi>thou muſt pay their Debt, Content</hi> ſays he, <hi>Here am I;</hi> and ſo <hi>he gives his back to the ſmiter, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair, and hid not his face from ſhame and ſpitting:</hi> If we were clear that our ſhare was there, and that our iniquities came in among the reſt to make up the Libel, and if we could aright diſcern him ſo pinſhed and ſtraitned in ſatisfying for us, would we not think our ſelves eternally obliged to him, to hate ſin, and to <hi>glorifie him in our bodies and ſpirits which are his?</hi> as it it 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> If indeed ye be Chriſts (as ye are all ready to profeſs your ſelves to be) he pays dear for you, and if ſo, will not this ly upon you as a juſt Debt to him, to glorifie him in your bodies and in your ſpirits? for both in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſpirit he payed for you.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It's a notable ground of conſolation to Believers againſt diſpondency and fear to appear before the Throne of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But though he was brought to priſon and to judgement, to death and to the grave, yet they did not, they could not detain him; <hi>He was taken,</hi> or as the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, he was lift up <hi>from priſon and from judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> being the ſame word that followeth, <hi>He was cut off out of the land of the living,</hi> which ſuppoſes a turn and change from his Humiliation to his Exaltation, and theſe words, <hi>Who ſhall declare his generation?</hi> Set out the unconceivable and unexpreſſible glory that Chriſt is exalted unto, ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 8.33., 35. Where theſe words are cited, it's ſaid, <hi>In his humiliation his judgement was taken away;</hi> That is in his loweſt ſtep of his Humiliation, his judgement, or that to which he was adjudged, was taken from him, and he was declared free; However, ſince in theſe words our Lords Humiliation is implyed, and his Exaltation expreſſed as following on it, we think it ſafeſt to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them ſo. The words put together hold out the high degree of Chriſts glorious exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſo as his generation cannot be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; <hi>He was taken from priſon and from judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and gloriouſly exalted in another manner, and to another degree of glory then either Angels or Believers are, or are capable to be; For he that is exalted is God, whoſe generation cannot be declared; <hi>Death having no more dominion over him,</hi> and he <hi>having the keyes of hell and of death;</hi> In a word, we take this, <hi>Who ſhall declare his generation?</hi> moſt immediatly to relate to Chriſt's Exaltation as Mediator, and to the glory wherewith he was inveſted, and to the dominion that he hath over all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: yet conſidering that the Prophets ſcope is to ſet out this as wonderful, and conſidering that the firſt ſtep of his Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is his Reſurrection, <hi>whereby</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4.) <hi>he was declared to be the Son of God with power;</hi> His Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:152256:128"/> being ſingular in this reſpect that he roſe by his own power, and conſidering that <hi>Acts</hi> 8.35. <hi>Philip</hi> began to preach to the <hi>Eunuch</hi> Jeſus Chriſt as the object of Faith; We think it reaſonable to conceive, that he preached Chriſt to be God, from this Text, ſo as the <hi>Eunuch</hi> might have a ſolid foundation for his faith; And this ſubſerving the ſcope, which is to ſet out the wonderfulneſs of Chriſts love to Elect ſinners, who being God, yet condeſcended to come thus low for ſaving of them; We may take in his God-head mediatly from which as the former ſteps of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion received worth and efficacy, ſo he was thereby ſuſtained and born up under all theſe ſufferings whereby his people are ſaved.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> expreſſions put together, we ſhall draw <hi>three Doctrines</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to three main Articles of our Faith.</p>
            <p>The 1. whereof is this, That our Lord Jeſus had an out-gate from, and victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the loweſt and moſt pinching pieces of His Humiliation and ſuffering; ſo that though he was at priſon and judgement, yet he was lift up from both, and had a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous out-gate: This takes in three things which the ſame grounds will confirm, 1. That in his loweſt ſtate and ſtep of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation he was ſuſtained and carried thorow, ſo that all the aſſaults which he was put to endure and encounter with from all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, wicked Men and Devils, did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome him. 2. That as he in himſelf was born thorow and ſuſtained; So in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God's bar at which he was arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he was abſolved and ſet free; He ſo came thorow by paying of the debt, that he had an Abſolviture, as it is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. Great is the myſtery of godlineſs, God was manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit;</hi> Our bleſſed Lord Jeſus being ſuſtained by the power of his God-head, was carried thorow in his ſufferings, payed the Elects debt, and received the ſentence of abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even as a perſon (to ſpeak with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in ſuch a ſubject) having payed the debt for which he was impriſoned, is abſolved and ſet free. 3. It takes in our Lords actual delivery, he not only receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſentence of abſolution, but was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſet free; ſo that as he was pleaſed to put himſelf in priſon and in ſtraits for us, ſo he was brought from every ſtep of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, <hi>from priſon and from judgement,</hi> from death and from the grave, <hi>He nailed the hand-writing which was againſt us to his croſs,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14, 15.) <hi>And having ſpoiled principalities and powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them in it;</hi> And as it is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. at the cloſe, He took the ſting from death, diſarmed it, and trode upon it: And there was neceſſity for this, even ſuch neceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y that it was impoſſible it could be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, as we have it, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.24. <hi>It was not poſſible that he could be holden of death.</hi> This will be clear if we conſider theſe things, 1. The perſon that ſuffered, he was not an ordinary, nay nor a meer man, but God-man; As is clear, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.27. cited out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. where it is ſaid, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell, neither wilt thou ſuffer thy Holy One to ſee corruption.</hi> 2. The end of Chriſts ſufferings; which was to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for the debt of his people, there having been no reckoning on his own ſcore or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he being ſtill in Gods favour and his Holy One in whom his Soul delighted all along his ſufferings; His ſufferings being for the ſins of his Elect, and he being to make application of his ſatisfaction, and of the purchaſe made thereby to the Elect for whom he ſuffered and purchaſed theſe things, by his interceſſion; There was a neceſſity that he ſhould come thorow; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes he ſhould not have been a perfect and compleat Saviour, <hi>Able to ſave to the uttermoſt theſe that come unto God by him,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>But ſuch a High Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, and made higher then the Heavens.</hi> 3. It's clear alſo if we conſider the nature of the Covenant, and of the promiſes made to him therein, upon his ingaging and undertaking for the Elect, as particularly <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>He ſhall ſee his ſeed, and prolong his dayes,</hi> his duration ſhall be for ever, <hi>The pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand,</hi> and <hi>I will divide him a portion with
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:152256:129"/> the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong:</hi> Our Lord's Exaltation and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over death being on the Lord's ſide conditioned to him the Mediator, as well as he ingaged to ſuffer, hence it's ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>He ſhall drink of the brook in the way, therefore ſhall he lift up the head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> are <hi>two,</hi> The 1. whereof ſerves for clearing and confirming our Faith in a fundamental Article of Chriſtianity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it were needleſs for us to preach, and needleſs for you to hear or believe, and that is, that our Lord Jeſus ſuffered and alſo got the victory over ſuffering, that <hi>he was raiſed from the dead, and declared to be the Son of God with power;</hi> intimating that Juſtice had gotten full ſatisfaction, in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and teſtimony whereof he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared free; which is a main thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have to believe; even that we have an exalted Chriſt, a raiſed up Saviour, who could not be detained by all the Elects guilt in priſon. 2. It ſerves to be matter of ſtrong conſolation, it puts life in all Chriſt's Offices and Qualifications, and in all the Promiſes made to Believers; to wit, that our Lord Jeſus is a living Chriſt, <hi>over whom death had no dominion,</hi> and he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came it, <hi>now to die no more;</hi> So that, as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt theſe that come unto God by him, ſeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them:</hi> There is nothing that a Soul needs or can deſire, but it is to be had in him: And if we would look to particular inſtances, much conſolation will ariſe from this ground; For 1. Hath a believing ſinner to do with chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges at the Bar of Juſtice, is it not unſpeakable conſolation that their debt is payed? Hence it's ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It's God that juſtifies; who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn? It's Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again;</hi> It's that which gives proof of compleat payment of the Elects debt and defiance to any challenges and accuſations to come againſt the Believer to his preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, becauſe Chriſt hath not only died, but is alſo riſen, Juſtice being well pleaſed with his ſatisfaction, he is let out of the Priſon. 2. If the Believer hath to do with corruption, with the Devil and with many enemies; Is it not ſtrong conſolation that our Lord is riſen and up, that <hi>the Prince of this world is judged,</hi> that Satan is troden under foot, and that <hi>be ſhall and muſt reign till all his enemies be made his foot-ſtool?</hi> 3. Our Lord's Reſurrection hath a twofold further conſolation with it to Believers, 1. It ſerves to be a ground for the exerciſing of Faith on him, that as he is riſen, (ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.) may we expect that being ſpiritually dead with him to ſin, we ſhall be <hi>with him raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to newneſs of life.</hi> 2. It is a pledge of Believers Exaltation and compleat victory over Death and the Grave, and over all Enemies; for Chriſt being raiſed as the Common Head of all Believers who are his Members, they by vertue of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by that ſame efficacy ſhall be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; And it's impoſſible that they can ly under corruption; This is our great conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation who are Believers, and live under the Goſpel, that we have not theſe things as a Propheſie of things to come, but as a plain Hiſtory of things in part done, and by and by to be compleatly done. 4. It hath alſo in it conſolation in reſpect of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral difficulties, what are they all? They are not ſure ſuch as Chriſt's were, and the day is coming when Believers ſhall have an out-gate from them all; And therefore ſince our Lord is up, let not Believers be afraid of any changes whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That our Lord Jeſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed up from his ſtate of Humiliation, is inveſted and put in a moſt excellent and glorious condition, even ſuch as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet cannot expreſs, <hi>Who can declare his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration?</hi> ſaith he; Who can declare how glorious he is now? Take two or three Scriptures to confirm this, 1. That <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20, 21. <hi>He hath ſet him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principalities and powers, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world but alſo in that which is to come, and hath put all things under his feet, and gave, him to be head over all things to the Church;</hi> Our Lords Throne is exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed far above Angels and Archangels, even out of ſight: The 2d. is <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. Where having
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:152256:129"/> ſpoken of his Humiliation, it follows, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name, that at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in Heaven, and,</hi> &amp;c. His Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſuch as hath a Dominion and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with it over every name; <hi>He having</hi> as it is, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. <hi>in all things the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency.</hi> The 3d. place is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Of the things which we have ſpoken, this is the ſum, we have ſuch an High Prieſt who is ſet on the right hand of Majesty in the Heavens;</hi> Where Chriſts Exaltation is ſet out to be ſuch as hath exalted him to the right hand of the Majeſty on high.</p>
            <p>Becauſe this is one of the great Articles of our Faith, to wit, <hi>That Christ roſe from death the third day, and aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and is ſet down on the right hand of God;</hi> We ſhall add a little more to clear it, and 1. We would know that this Exaltation of our Lord is not to be underſtood of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation properly as he is God, in which reſpect there is no up nor down in him, though his declarative glory was valid for a time during his humiliation, yet in himſelf as he was God, he was ſtill glorious and bleſſed over all. 2. When we ſpeak of Chriſt's Exaltation as Mediator, and as Man, we do not mean that his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath loſt the eſſential properties of a Creature, As if now when exalted he were wholly or only God, or as if the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Humane Nature were ſwallowed up in the God-head; That were inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with his being true Man, and would marr and obſtruct our conſolation exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; But his Exaltation conſiſteth, 1. In the manifeſtation and dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aration of the perſon that was humbled and brought low, to be God Omnipotent, Omnipreſent, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, infinitly Wiſe, Powerful, Juſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For though theſe properties agree not to the Humane Nature, yet they agree to his perſon, and they are manifeſted to be in him without queſtion. 2. In the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of the Humane Nature of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to an inconceivable hight of glory, ſuch as the Humane Nature united to the Divine Nature is capable of, by very many degrees beyond any thing that the Elect whether Angels or Men are capable of; The perſonal union making him capable of far more glory, and his excellent Offices calling for it. 3. This Exaltation conſiſts in his abſolute Dominion and Kingly Power, which is more obſervably, directly, and plainly manifeſted in the dayes of the Goſpel-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration then it was under the Law; So that now he is clearly known in reſpect of his Kingly Office to be God in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cloathed with our fleſh, and to be <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This Exaltation conſiſts in Chriſts being furniſhed with qualifications ſuitable to that glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein he is inveſted; And though theſe qualifications of the Man Chriſt be not ſimply infinit, yet they are far above what we can conceive; And the qualifications of the Perſon God-man are infinite, in which reſpect he is Omnipotent.

We conceive among many faults and evils in Believers, this is a root-evil, even low thoughts of glorious Chriſt, ſo that becauſe he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come low to lift us up, we are ready to think the leſs of him, but, O! that we could behold the glorious condition, he is exalted unto, and could look upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

It ſerves to encourage you all to receive him; He is no mean perſon that wooes you, but <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords;</hi> and if ye think it a happineſs to be for ever with him, then let it move you to cloſe with him; if ye do ſo, ye ſhall be made glorious as he is glorious, a due proportion betwixt the Head and the Members being kept; ye ſhall <hi>ſit on the ſame throne with him</hi> and <hi>behold his glory;</hi> as he prayeth <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>I will that theſe whom thou hast given me may be with me to behold my glory;</hi> this is certainly a great Bargain; if Chriſt be glorious, he calleth you to ſhare with him in the ſame glory. 2. It ſerves for the conſolation of Believers who have received him, ye have an excellent Mediator, a moſt glorious Head and Huſband, and a moſt excellent Dowry, and ye ſhall know it to your ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundant ſatisfaction and joy in that day, when (as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.) <hi>Ye ſhall be brought unto the king in raiment of needle work,</hi> and ſhall <hi>enter into the kings palace,</hi> and ſhare of his glory, and <hi>ſee him face to face,</hi> and <hi>ſit with him on his throne, even as he hath overcome, and is ſet down with his Father on his throne;</hi> labour to be ſtayed in the faith and hope of this good, glorious, and deſireable day that is coming, when we ſhall not only ſee but partake of, and be fully and for ever poſſeſſed in that <hi>which eye hath not ſeen, ear hath not heard, neither hath it entered in the heart of man to conceive of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. From the words as we exponed them <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt who ſuffered, and was in ſuffering brought very low, is God; We find ordinarily in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially thorow the New Teſtament, theſe three going together, 1. Chriſts Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation. 2. His Exaltation on the back of that, And 3ly. His Godhead; His Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation is not readily ſpoken of without his Exaltation, nor his Exaltation without his Godhead; becauſe it's impoſſible to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Chriſts Exaltation from his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; his Exaltation being the evidence of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:152256:130"/> his Godhead; and the Prophet's ſcope here being to ſet but Chriſt's Exaltation, and <hi>Philip</hi> preaching of it to the <hi>Eunuch</hi> from this Text; it's doubtleſs the contemplation of Chriſt's Godhead that occaſioneth this admiring-exclamation, <hi>who ſhall declare his generation?</hi> which we apply not ſo much to the ineffableneſs of his generation, as to its being an evidence that he is God: There are <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> ways whereby the Scripture confirms this, let me deſire you by the way not to look on this as a little momentuous or but a common Doctrine; &amp; ſince there are many ſo ignorant, that we would be aſhamed to tell what we hear from ſome of you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Godhead of Jeſus Chriſt, ye would take the better heed to it, it being a main pillar of Chriſtian Religion, without which our Preaching and your Faith are vain, for he is not believed on at all if ye reſt not on him as God: But to proſecute what we propoſed, to wit, theſe ſeveral ways whereby the Scripture confirms this truth, and to this purpoſe conſider, 1. The expreſs Titles and Names that are given to him in Scripture, and ſome Scripture-ſayings of him which hold it out; three whereof we ſhall inſtance, The firſt is that of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 9.6, 7. Where, when Chriſt is propheſied of, it's ſaid, <hi>Unto us a child is born, unto us a ſon is given, and the government ſhall be upon his ſhoulders,</hi> and what is he? <hi>He ſhall be called wonderful, Counſellour, the Mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace, of the increaſe of his government and peace there ſhall be no end;</hi> Here we have theſe three, His Humiliation, Exaltion and God-head; His Humiliation, <hi>Unto us a child is born, unto us a ſon is given;</hi> His Exaltation, <hi>Of the increaſe of his government<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and peace there ſhall be no end, upon the throne of</hi> David <hi>and his kingdom, to order it and to eſtabliſh it with judgment and with juſtice;</hi> And his Godhead is interjected and put in between theſe two, <hi>In the names and titles given to him, Wonderful Counſellour, the Mighty God, the Everlaſting Father,</hi> not as perſonally taken, but (as the word ſignifies) <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Eternity,</hi> from whom all things have their Being; and for the ſame reaſon <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.14. He is called <hi>Immanuel, God with us,</hi> A 2d. place is that of <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery</hi> (he did God no wrong) <hi>to be equal with God, he made himſelf of no reputation; and took on him the form of a ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God alſo hath highly exalted him and given him a name above every name,</hi> &amp;c. A 3d. place is that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpoke in time paſt unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his ſon whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the worlds,</hi> &amp; what is he by whom he ſpake to us? <hi>who being the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himſelf purged our ſins, he ſat down on the right hand of the majeſty on high;</hi> there is here much of Chriſts excellency holden forth, he is <hi>the brightneſs of the fathers glory, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs image of his perſon;</hi> the beam of the Sun is not liker to the Suns light, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the ſeal on the wax is no liker to the ſeal, then the Son is to the Father, (nay, the livelyeſt reſemblances fall infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſhort of a full and exact reſemblance) the Father and he being the ſame God, and he being compared with the Father, not ſimply as God eſſentially taken, but as the ſecond perſon of the Trinity compared with him who is the firſt perſon; O deep and adorable myſtery!</p>
            <p>A 2d. way to clear and confirm it, is to conſider his works oft-times joyned with his name; The works of Creation, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Redemption, and guiding of his Church, ſo we have it <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was the word,</hi> the ſubſtantial word of the Father, the Son of his love, called the <hi>word,</hi> either as expreſſing the Fathers image as a mans word expreſſeth his mind, or becauſe as Prophet of the Church he hath revealed the Fathers will; Its ſaid that this word was not only <hi>with God,</hi> but <hi>was God;</hi> and then follows in ſeveral <hi>Verſes</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether his Works, the works of Creation, <hi>all things were made by him,</hi> &amp;c. the works of Providence are attributed to him, <hi>John</hi> 5.17. <hi>My father worketh hitherto, and I work,</hi> and the work of Redemption and his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:152256:131"/> going thorow with it, declare him to be the Son of God; for none but God could redeem his Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. For clearing and confirming of this truth, we may take the expreſs confeſſion of the Saints in Scripture whereon there is much weight laid; and I ſhall name but five or ſix of their confeſſions, which to this purpoſe are expreſsly and fully recorded, The 1. Is that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Whom do men ſay that I am,</hi> Peter <hi>anſwered; thou art the ſon of the living God</hi> and Chriſt ſays, <hi>Bleſſed art thou</hi> Simon Barjona <hi>fleſh and blood hath not revealed that unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven;</hi> to let us know that it is not ſuch a little thing to believe Chriſts Godhead as many take it to be; and then he calls himſelf <hi>the rock on which his Church is built;</hi> Chriſt's Godhead is the foundation of Chriſtianity. A 2d. is <hi>John</hi> 1.49. in <hi>Nathanaels</hi> words; Chriſts tells him, <hi>before</hi> Philip <hi>called thee when thou was under the fig-tree, I ſaw thee,</hi> and he having gotten this proof of Chriſts omniſcience, preſently breaks out, <hi>Rabbi, thou art the ſon of God, thou art the king of</hi> Iſrael; and that is the firſt thing his faith evidenceth it ſelf in. A 3d. place is <hi>John</hi> 6.67, 68, 69. where, when Chriſt is ſaying to the twelve, <hi>will ye alſo leave me?</hi> Simon <hi>anſwers, Lord, to whom ſhall we go, thou haſt the words of eternal life, and we believe and are ſure, that thou art the Christ the ſon of the living God;</hi> there is mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h in theſe words, <hi>we believe and are ſure</hi> that it is ſo. A 4th. place is <hi>John</hi> 11.27. and it is <hi>Martha</hi> her confeſſion, <hi>yea Lord, I believe that thou art the Chriſt the ſon of God which ſhould come into the world.</hi> The 5th. place is that of <hi>John</hi> 20.28. where, when Chriſt bids <hi>Thomas</hi> reach hither his hand and put it into his ſide, his glory ſhines ſo full in his face, that he cryes out, <hi>My Lord and my God,</hi> and his faith is ſummed up and compended in that. The laſt place that we ſhall name is that of <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. and its the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> confeſſion, <hi>I believe that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is the ſon of God,</hi> which is the ſum of his faith.</p>
            <p>The 4th. and laſt way of confirmation of this great truth, is drawen from the worſhip which is due unto him, and hath been given unto him; He is the object of Faith, <hi>John</hi> 14.11. <hi>ye believe in God, believe alſo in me;</hi> He is the object of Prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.59. <hi>They ſtoned</hi> Stephen <hi>calling upon God, ſaying, Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit,</hi> and frequently elſe-where in Scripture he is prayed unto, though theſe two are not too curiouſly to be ſeparated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. The firſt Uſe ſerves to ſtrengthen your Faith in this, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt who ſuffered for ſinners, and is made offer of to them in the Goſpel, is God equal with the Father, and ſo he is to be cloſed with and reſted on as the brightneſs of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers glory; the reaſon why we would have you confirmed in the Faith of this, is not ſmall, for its a moſt neceſſary thing, and without the faith of it, all the work of our ſalvation will hang louſe; neither can we have any claim to Eternal Life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we deſire you particularly who are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Hearers, and who have the name of Chriſt often in your mouths, and yet know not what he is, to know, remember and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he that is the ſon of <hi>Mary,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the eternal ſon of God, being God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was incarnate, and before the World was made, and the Maker of all that was made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. The ſecond Uſe ſerves to let you know, That though it be a moſt neceſſary thing to be confirmed in the faith of this Truth, that Chriſt is God, yet it's a greater difficulty to believe and be perſwaded of it then the moſt part take it to be; many ſad proofs whereof we have in Folks words, and moe in their practice, <hi>Fleſh and blood</hi> (ſaith Chriſt <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.) <hi>hath not revealed this unto thee;</hi> It's a wonder whence many Folks faith comes who never found any the leaſt difficulty in this, and it's a wonder that ſo few are through in the faith of it, ſo that if they were called and put to it, they durſt not ſwear that he is God; yea, if we would look in a little further, we would find that the faith of this is but ſcarce amongſt us, not to ſpeak of the groſs igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of many, who will ſay when asked, that he is not equal with the Father, or that he was made God, and other ſuch like expreſſions will they have, that are abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to be once named amongſt Chriſtians;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:152256:131"/> Folks through their ignorance falling into damnable Hereſies on the matter, and yet not knowing that they do ſo; As if our bleſſed Lord were a made god, and not the ſame God with the Father; For the proving of him to be God, proves him to be the ſame God, there being but one God.</p>
            <p>Ye would conſider for convincing you that it is thus with many of you, 1. The little fear that is in men and women of the Majeſty of Chriſt as God, they durſt not walk with ſo little fear of him if they believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indeed that he were God; What made the <hi>Jews</hi> with the Scribes and Phariſees to ſpit upon him and deſpiſe him? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wanted the Faith of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; And have not ye the ſame nature in you? Ye live in a place where the Faith of Chriſts Godhead is profeſſed and is not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, but your practice ſayes to behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that ye believe it not, becauſe ye fear him not. 2. That your ſouls do ſo little welcome the offer of the Goſpel, that tells that ye believe him not to be God. 3. That ye do not place your happineſs in Believing on him, and in the way of holineſs; ye ſay in effect, wherefore ſerves Chriſt? ye care not for him; Hence it is that ſo many live contentedly without him, and are not ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous about the enjoying of him. 4. Even in Believers there is much unbelief of this truth, which is ſadly evidenced by this, that they do not ſo bleſs themſelves in him, and that they do not ſo reckon themſelves to have come well to, and to be made up in him, as <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. Where he ſaith, and holily glorieth, <hi>The lines are fallen unto me in a pleaſant place,</hi> &amp;c. And by the frequent diſcouragement that is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Believers, as if Chriſt had not the guiding of them, and of what concerns them, or could not guide all well enough for their good; If he were believed to be God, it would quaſh temptations, baniſh diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, comfort under croſſes, ſweeten every condition, induce to holineſs, reſtrain from ſin; And in a word, it cannot be told what is in the boſome of this one truth when ſolidly believed; For what can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be wanting to the Believer in him that is God? He hath the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to ſupply what ever they want, and ſuſtains the relation of a Husband to the Believer to make it forth-coming; And he is furniſhed with ſuitable qualifications to make the application thereof; What then could be wanting if this were thorowly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that he is God? Let me ſay it to you, the Faith of this would provoke to more holineſs, and to ſtudy more the power then the profeſſion of Religion, and would help to live a more comfortable life in every condition.</p>

            <p>In the former part of this <hi>verſe,</hi> we ſhew, that there was a hint given of Chriſt's Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, of the Exaltation and Glory of the Mediator following on the back of his low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſufferings; An ineffable and inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Glory, which the Prophet rather paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with a ſort of non-pluſſing ſilence, then inſiſteth in the declaration of it, <hi>Who ſhall declare his generation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We come now to the laſt part of the words, <hi>For he was cut off out of the land of the living, for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſtricken;</hi> They are added as a reaſon of the former, and the one part of them is a reaſon of the other, he had ſaid before. <hi>Who can declare his generation?</hi> Who can ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare and unfold how gloriouſly the Mediator is exalted: And he gives this for the reaſon of it, <hi>For he was cut off out of the land of the living;</hi> The force of which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, that he humbled himſelf, therefore God hath highly exalted him, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle reaſons, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.9. So tha this is not added as being poſterior to his Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but as a reaſon ſhewing the connexion of his Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ltation with his Humiliation; And left it ſhould be a ſtumbling to any, that this glorious perſon ſuffered death, he gives the reaſon of that alſo, which ſtrengthens the reaſon of his Exaltation <hi>For the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſtricken,</hi> or (as the word is) <hi>The stroak was on him,</hi> he ſuffered not for any wrong in himſelf, but for the ſins of his own elect people: The firſt part clearly looks to Chriſts death, which was a Propheſie in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> his time, but is now a Hiſtorical narr tion to us, we having the Goſpel as a Commentary on it. To be <hi>cut off out of the land of the living,</hi> is to have an end put to the natural life, which is ordinarily done by death; But <hi>cutting off</hi> here ſignifies to be taken away not in an ordinary but in an extraordinary way, to be removed by a violent death by the ſtroak of Juſtice.</p>

            <p>We may ſhortly take theſe two <hi>Obſerves</hi> here for the confirmation of two Articles of our Faith; Looking on it, 1.

It ſhews the reality of our Lord's ſufferings, and that they were not imaginary, but that as he was a real and true man, ſo his ſufferings were moſt real; His ſoul was ſeparat from his body, though the union betwixt both his body and ſoul and the God-head continued ſtill. 3.

            <p>For clearing of the words, it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, 1. What is meant here by <hi>my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</hi> 2. What is it to be <hi>ſtricken</hi> or ſmitten <hi>for them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the 1. <hi>My people,</hi> it is a diſcriminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or differencing thing of ſome from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; And therefore, by <hi>my people</hi> here is not meant, 1. All the world, or all that ever lived and had a beeing; We find not any where in Scripture that theſe are called <hi>my people,</hi> or <hi>God's people,</hi> but when ever <hi>my people</hi> is ſpoken of, it is uſed to rid Marches betwixt his people and other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are not his, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 10 26, 27. <hi>Ye believe not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheep, my ſheep hear my voice, and I know them,</hi> which ſuppoſeth that ſome are his, and others not ſo his, and ſo <hi>my people</hi> cannot be all the world. Neither 2. Can it be meant of the whole viſible Church; who in reſpect of the external adminiſtration of the Covenant, are ſometimes called his people, as all <hi>Iſrael</hi> are; There is a narrower march or boundary drawn, <hi>John</hi> 10.26.

Can it be limited to them that were actually converted and Believers, for he ſays (as I iuſt now hinted) that <hi>he hath other ſheep that are not yet brought in,</hi> and he is ſaid <hi>to gather together into one the children of God that were ſcattered abroad, John</hi> 11.52. So then by <hi>my people</hi> muſt be underſtood theſe who in G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d's eternal purpoſe are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat by the Decree of Election to be his own, even theſe whom he hath choſen to glorifie himſelf in and by them through his Grace, and to glorifie them with himſelf; Even theſe ſpoken of, <hi>John</hi> 17.6. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me;</hi> They are the people who were tranſacted for in the Covenant of Redemption, and that were given by the Father to the Son to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by him; It was for their ſins, even for the ſins of the Elect that our Lord Jeſus was ſtricken.</p>
            <p>As for the 2d. What is it to be <hi>ſtricken for their tranſgreſſion?</hi> The meaning is, the meritorious cauſe of their ſtroak was on Chriſt, which intimats to us, that his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and death were procured by the ſins of the Elect of God; His ſtroak, or the ſtroak that was upon him (as the word is) was the amends that Juſtice got for their ſins; In a word, the ſtroak that the Elects ſins procured and merited; <hi>Took him out of</hi> (or away from) <hi>the land of the living, brought him to priſon and to judgement, and made his ſoul an offering for ſin:</hi> Neither can this be otherwayes underſtood; For it is not ſaid that for their good, or for their behove only, or to be an example and pattern of patience only to them, he was ſtricken, as ſome groſsly erroneous and prophane men expound the words, but <hi>for their tranſgreſſions was he ſtricken;</hi> That is, it was their guilt which he having undertaken and engaged to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for, which made him lyable to this ſtroak.</p>
            <p>In this part of the words thus opened up, we have two notable <hi>Points</hi> concerning the Covenant of Redemption, 1. The Party for whom it is contrived and intended, and that is the Elect or <hi>God's People;</hi> It is not all the World, nor all Viſible-Church-members that God tranſacted for in the bargain with the Mediator, but <hi>my people,</hi> the Elect of God; they were ſo conſidered in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action and in the execution. 2. The great price that was ſought or required, that was
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:152256:133"/> offered, and that was agreed upon for the Redemption of the Elect, to wit, the death of the Mediator, even his dying the curſed death of the Croſs; This is the ſum, for the tranſgreſſions of God's people the ſtroak was upon him; God's deſign being to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his grace in the ſalvation of ſo many, ſin having interveened to bring them under the curſe; There is upon the one ſide the Lord's giving of them to the Mediator to be redeemed by him, and upon the other ſide, the Mediators accepting of them on the terms propoſed, he is content to ſatisfie for them, to take the ſtroak on himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by them, that they may go free; each of theſe may be conſidered ſeveral wayes for furniſhing of ſweet Doctrines.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the firſt of theſe <hi>Obſerve,</hi> that there are ſome differenced from others in reſpect of God's purpoſe, ſome choſen of God for his people beſide all the reſt of the World; For ſome are here God's people ere they be born, and ere Chriſt die for them, <hi>John</hi> 17.16. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gavest them me;</hi> They are ſuppoſed to be God's people in ſome peculiar reſpect, ere they be given to Chriſt to be redeemed by him; In a word, the Lord hath an elect people, or a people choſen to ſalvation in his eternal purpoſe and decree, an elect people, or a people choſen out of the world, which in this reſpect are not his people, or are not elected. There are four qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or properties in this Doctrine, which will ſerve to clear it; 1. When we ſay there is ſuch a decree of Election, we ſay that it is a <hi>diſcriminating</hi> or <hi>differencing decree;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or whereby there is a taking of ſome, and not all, a taking of one, and leaving ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a taking of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and a leaving of <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> a taking of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and a leaving of <hi>Eſau,</hi> as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. And this diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or differencing hath theſe four ſteps, 1. There is a differencing in Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in reſpect of the end, while all men are alike before him, ſome are deſigned to erernal life, others not, therefore <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. it's ſaid, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherite the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world,</hi> and in this reſpect the <hi>Book of Life</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>opened, Revel.</hi> 20.12. 2. This differencing is in reſpect of God's offering and giving of them to the Mediator in the Covenant of Redemption, wherein ſome, not all, are given to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17 2. <hi>That he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him out of the world;</hi> Where it is clear, that ſo many are given to him in reference to whom he is to exerciſe his offices. 3. There is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing in reſpect of Chriſt's undertaking and executing his Offices for them, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of them, <hi>John</hi> 17.9. <hi>For their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf,</hi> I have ſeparated my ſelf to the Office of Mediator, and do offer my ſelf for them, <hi>that they alſo may be ſanctified;</hi> And <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world,</hi> it's of them that he maketh that ſweet account, <hi>John</hi> 6.39. <hi>This is the Fathers will that ſent me, that of all that he hath given me I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day;</hi> And of whom he ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 10.28, 29. <hi>I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand;</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers and is accountable for them, and for them only, he will count for no other as being redeemed by him, and to be made partakers of his glory. 4. This differencing is in reſpect of the promiſes made upon Gods part to the Mediator in favours of the Elect, and of the benefits that flow to them from the Covenant; He hath not promiſed to juſtifie all, nor to make all believe, but ſome only; He, as it were, ſaith to the Mediator, theſe I give thee to be redeemed by thee, and on the laying down of thy life, and ſatisfying for them, I promiſe to make them believe, and that through faith in thee they ſhall be juſtified, therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>Murmure not among your ſelves, no man can come unto me except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who hath ſent me draw him;</hi> And who are they that ſhall believe on him? See <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>All that the Father hath given me ſhall come unto me, and him that cometh I will in no wiſe caſt him out,</hi> but will make him dearly welcome; And <hi>verſ.</hi> 45. <hi>Every one that hath heard and learned of the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther cometh unto me;</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 17.2. <hi>That he
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:152256:134"/> ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him:</hi> Thus ye ſee what we mean when we call this a differencing Decree. 2. We ſay that it is a <hi>definite Decree,</hi> both in reſpect of tho number numbered, that is, about ſo many and no moe, and not all; and in reſpect of the number that numbers, ſuch a man and ſuch a woman in particular in ſuch a place, and not ſuch an other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; They are all particularly deſigned and are therefore ſaid to be <hi>written in the Lambs Book of Life;</hi> It is not all who are foreſeen to believe who are elected, as if election did follow believing, as the cauſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; But it's ſuch a number whom the Lord ingageth to the Mediator to draw, to teach and make them believers. 3. We ſay it is a <hi>Decree that is free,</hi> as to all merit in them whom it reacheth, and it's free in theſe three reſpects. 1. In reſpect of any thing in the perſon or perſons elected, who are ſuppoſed to be lying as the reſt of the World, therefore it's ſaid of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau,</hi> Rom. 9 11. <hi>The children being not yet born, neither having done good or evil, that the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand,</hi> &amp;c. That is, God reſpected not the doing good or evil in his electing of the one, and paſſing by of the other. 2. In reſpect of Chriſt's ſatisfaction and redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, which preſuppoſeth this Decree to be, and is the mids by which it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; ſo that we are redeemed becauſe we are elect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d; The Elect were Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when Chriſt did undertake and engage for them, and in this reſpect election is a Foun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ain-grace, and Chriſt's death is not the cauſe of Election though it be the cauſe of all the benefits that follow upon it. 3. It's free in reſpect of God's abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, who acts herein according to the purpoſe of his own will, having no reaſon without himſelf, as it is clear, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>Ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n ſo, Father, becauſe it ſeemed good in thy ſight;</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Being predestinate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purpoſe of him who worketh all things according to the counſel of his own will:</hi> As the Potter hath power over the Clay, and makes of the ſame lump on Veſſel to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and another to diſhonour as he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; So the Lord acts moſt Soveraignly in the Decree of Election. 4. We ſay that this Decree is <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>peremptory;</hi> Which is not ſo to be underſtood as if it admitted of no midſes in the execution of it; But this is the meaning, that the performing and bringing about thereof depends on nothing without God, neither can it be poſſibly fruſtrated; Theſe ſheep can never be pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his hand, neither can they ever periſh, but muſt needs all and every one of them actually enjoy that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed for them by this Decree, elſe they could not be called God's people if they might, not be his; Thus ye ſee wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t is the meaning of theſe words <hi>my people,</hi>

               </gap>hat is, his Elect people in or by the Decree of Election.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhortly give you ſome few grounds from Scripture to clear and confirm this truth; The 1. whereof is taken from the names that the people of God get, and from the expreſſions that are uſed in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mention of them in Scripture, which will infer all that hath been ſaid, as namely they are called <hi>my ſheep, John</hi> 10. his Sheep that he knows, as it were by head-mark, by name and ſirn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me, which cannot but be his; they are call d <hi>the election of Grace, Rom.</hi> 11.5. <hi>at this preſent time there is a remnant according to the election of grace;</hi> and <hi>verſ</hi> 7. <hi>the election hath obtained and the reſt were blinded;</hi> it's impoſſible but the Elect muſt obtain, there being an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable connexion betwixt the decree and the end thereof; they are ſaid to be <hi>written in the Lambs book of life before the foundation of the world,</hi> before there was any mention of themſelves, or conſideration of ought in themſelves, they are ſaid to be loved and beloved and ordained to eternal life, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life, believed,</hi> where believing is made a fruit and effect of this decree of election, its ſo far from being a cauſe thereof; they are called <hi>bleſsed of the Father,</hi> Matth. 25. and theſe whom he bleſſeth cannot but be bleſſed; they are called ſuch as <hi>are given to Chriſt,</hi> holding forth a peculiar differencing of them from others; they are called the

               </gap>he truth of this Doctrine concerning election in all the ſteps of it. As, 1. In Gods mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the offer and gift of ſome to the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, it's only ſome that he gives and not all. 2. In Chriſts acceptation of the offer and gift: He prays for ſome, he ſanctifies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for ſome, and for ſome he compts and not for all. 3. There is not a promiſe in all the Covenant of Redemption, whether it be of Grace or of Glory, but it is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Elect only, and not for all, <hi>I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh</hi> John 10. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power,</hi> Pſal. 110.3.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:152256:135"/> the redemption of the Elect; for if there be a differencing of them from others by the decree of election, then there muſt be a differencing of them from others in Chriſts laying down of his life for them and not for any others; Election is the key of all; there is ſuch a people, and they are the object of the Covenant of Redemption, whoſe good is ſought after and agreed upon therein, and not of any others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. It ſerves for the confirmation of a weighty truth, and we would have you not to think little of any piece of truth. We ſhall not here follow the ſubtile cavillings of Adv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rſaries againſt this truth, only we would have you confirmed in the faith of it, For, 1. If ye be not clear and eſtabliſhed in the faith of this truth, ye will be in great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard not only to make muddy, but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and ſtop the whole current and tract of Grace, ſo that Grace ſhall be a common thing, Heaven and Happineſs ſhall go by by gueſs; Redemption ſhall be univerſal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but let this truth be once well eſtabliſhed, that God hath a peculiar people for whom the Mediator tranſacted, and theſe errors fall to the ground and evaniſh; for it is the love of election from which all the reſt of the benefits that come to the elect flow, and this love is peculiar, therefore there cannot be a common application of it; it's the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarneſs of Grace that commends it to the ſouls of Believers, and makes it wonderful to them; that God ſhould have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them that were by nature ſeparate from God as well as others; that their caſe being common, his love ſhould be peculiar, is indeed juſt and great matter of wonder; hence comes in that ſong, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Thou hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred and tongue and people and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> not all of every nation, people, tongue and kindred are redeemed, but ſome out of every one of theſe; let this then be taken for a ſolid truth, that the Lord in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal purpoſe hath made a difference and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of ſome from others, which is the great ground of the title that God hath to theſe ſome.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. Clearneſs in this truth, ſerves to keep the hearts of Gods people in awe of him, to lift him up very high in their eſteem as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign over the Creature: And if any ſhould quarrel with God and ſay, why did God ſo? that of the Apoſtle comes well in for an anſwer, <hi>Who art thou O man that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyest against God?</hi> it's his ſoveraign plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure who is ſupream Potter and hath <hi>power over the clay to make one veſſel to honour and another to diſhonour:</hi> when the Soul doth thus take up God as having all Mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him as a lump of Clay, and chooſing out of it, and writing up one man and not another, it muſt needs in a tranſport of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration ſay, O! what a great and ſoveraign God muſt he be, who did determine and write down the eternal condition of men before ever the world was?</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. This to the people of God, 1. Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wonderful grace, when they having gotten their calling and election made ſure, come in and read their names in Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of election before they had a Being; And 2. It is to them matter of exceeding great conſolation: 1. I ſay it preacheth wonderful grace, that freely chooſed them; and that when thouſands of great Men, and Noblemen were paſſed by, ſuch a poor body that was half a fool in compariſon with them, ſhould be choſen; according to that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>Not many wiſe after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble hath God called, but he hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world, weak and baſe, and things that are not,</hi> to make them kings and prieſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God and his Father. 2. It's matter of exceeding great conſolation to them that it's <hi>free</hi> and <hi>ſure; free,</hi> even ſo free that it ſtops the mouth of boaſting; for what I pray hath an elect more to ſpeak of as a ground of boaſting than a Pagan in <hi>America,</hi> or one in Hell? <hi>Who made thee to differ, or what haſt thou O man that thou haſt not received?</hi> it's election that makes the difference, and it's <hi>ſure,</hi> for their ſalvation is founded on Gods purpoſe and decree, which is the ſolid reſt of a Believer; kindneſs began not on our ſide but on Gods, as Chriſt ſays, <hi>Ye have not choſen me, but I have choſen you,</hi> John 15.16.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly. It ſays this, That all of you had need
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:152256:135"/> to make your calling and election ſure, that is the very hinge of Believers conſolation, even to have the proof of it in your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that ye are inrolled here, to get out the extract of this decree, that ye may ſee and read your names in it: Hence many ſtreams of conſolation flow out; if it be ſo with you, then ye were given to Chriſt; Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to ſatisfie Juſtice for you; ye ſhall get Faith and more Faith, ye ſhall get Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Sanctification, and ye ſhall get Heaven and Glory at the end of your courſe. If it be ſaid, this is much, how ſhall it be brought about? we anſwer, it's not impoſſible, and to make it out, take but two words, that are both directions and marks, the practice whereof will give a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid proof of your inrolment in Gods book, whence all theſe great and glorious things have their riſe. 1. Where there is a yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſts call in the Goſpel, &amp; a cloſing with him, that evidenceth election; for it is certain that none ſhall, nor can come to Chriſt and believe in him but the Elect, and whoever are elected muſt and ſhall come, ſooner or later, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come unto me,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 10.4. <hi>His ſheep follow him and know his voice;</hi> they accept of and make welcome Chriſts call in the Goſpel, and they that accept of it are elect: So that there is no need of any new revelation about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, neither needs there any torturing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety to know how to come by thy name in the roll of the Elect; try it by this, if thou haſt given obedience to the call of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, if thou haſt in the ſenſe of thy need of a Saviour fled unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſus Chriſt, and on his own terms cloſed with him, by this thy tenure or holding is ſure; and by this thou haſt an evidence that thou art an elect; for his Sheep come unto him and hear his voice; and as many of you as ſoundly believe on him, and have betaken your ſelves to him for life and ſalvation, have the ſeal and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in your ſelves that your names were in Gods roll and book before the World was: But if this be not, debate, diſpute &amp; queſtion as ye will about it, whatever may be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ye have no evidence for the time of your election. 2. Where there is real Holineſs, or a real ſtudy and endeavour to be holy and more holy, it is an evidence of election, and of a perſons being inrolled in the volumn of the book of Gods decree; becauſe Holineſs is a fruit of election, as is clear <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>According as he hath choſen us before the foundation of the world that we ſhould be holy;</hi> never a perſon is really holy but ſuch as God deſigned ſhould be holy; to this purpoſe the Apoſtle having 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. ſpoken of election, <hi>The foundation of the Lord ſtands ſure, having this ſeal, the Lord knows who are his, and let every one that names the name of Chriſt depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, but in a great houſe are not only veſſels of gold,</hi> &amp;c. he ſubjoyns, <hi>If a man therefore purge himſelf from theſe he ſhall be a veſſel unto honour ſanctified,</hi> &amp;c. not that election de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on mans Holineſs, but by his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he ſhall be manifeſted to be, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted an elect Veſſel, and may warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably conclude himſelf to be ſuch; ſo that true holineſs brings folk to be acquainted with the great ſecret of Election, and gives them boldneſs to make the application of it: There is nothing that men readily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more to know than this, whether they be elected or not, here is a ſure way to come by the knowledge of it, even to ſtudy to believe and to be holy, and then we may be confident that our names were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Lambs book of Life, but if we ſlight faith in Chriſt and Holineſs, whatever may be in God's purpoſe about us, we have for preſent no ground to conclude our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon God himſelf fixus in theſe things that have ſuch mighty conſequents depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them.</p>

            <p>THE Prophet hath been long in deſcribing Chriſts Sufferings, and hath ſhowen what height they came to, even <hi>to priſon and to judgment,</hi> and to death it ſelf, <hi>He was cut off out of the land of the living;</hi> now he caſts in a word to ſhew wherefore all this was, or what was the procuring cauſe that brought all this ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſorrow on Chriſt, which alſo was the end that he had before him in it, in theſe words, <hi>for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſtricken;</hi> we ſhew that by <hi>my people</hi> here, was not meant all men and women in the world, nay, not all men who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally called in the viſible Church, but his Elect only, theſe whom he hath choſen to be his People, and ſeparated from others by an eternal decree of Election; we ſhew alſo that theſe words, <hi>for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſtricken,</hi> do not contain on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a reaſon of Chriſt's extream ſuffering, even of his being <hi>brought to priſon and to judgment</hi> before men, but alſo and mainly of his being brought ſo before God, and of his being <hi>cut-off;</hi> for the ſins of Gods People are not laid to his charge before men, but before God they are; and ſo it does imply an influence that the ſins of the Elect had upon Chriſts Sufferings, and a reſpect that his Sufferings had to their ſins; the Elects ſins procured theſe Sufferings to him, and his Sufferings were undergone by him for the ſatisfying of Juſtice for their ſins, and for the removing of them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not inſiſt further in the expoſition of the words, having opened them up the laſt day, but ſhall hint at a few <hi>Doctrines</hi> from them; and becauſe they are general and more doctrinal, I ſhall be the ſhorter in ſpeaking to them; though it may be ye think not ſo much of them, yet they are not a little for your edification; and if ye were ſuitably ſenſible of ſin, and of your hazard, there is no Doctrine concerning the Covenant of Redemption but it would be uſeful and refreſhing to you.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral things implyed here concerning the efficacy of the price of Chriſt's death, and concerning the extent of it, as it's laid down as a price for the ſins of the Elect, which I ſhall firſt paſſingly touch upon, and then come to theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that are more directly held forth in the words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, it is implyed, that there is a people of God ſeparated from others, and choſen by him, on whom he intended and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:152256:136"/> purpoſed before the World was, to glorifie his grace; The very deſignation that they get here clears this; It's <hi>my people,</hi> not only of the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor my people only of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but my people both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>John</hi> 10. <hi>Other ſheep have I which are not of this fold, them I muſt bring i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is implyed that this Decree of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is antecedanius to, and goes before the Covenant of Redemption in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it flows not from Chriſts death as the effect of it, but is prior to it; for if Chriſts death be the mean, or price (as indeed it is) Whereby the ſins of God's Elect peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſatisfied for, then the Decree of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection muſt preceed it; Only we would beware to aſcribe to God any priority or poſteriority in his Decrees in order of time, for he is infinite in wiſdom and foreſight, and able to look on all things with one blink of beholding, and to decree things infinite in number at once, which we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of, nor comprehend; But this we ſay, that conſidering the order of things, the Decree of Election is not a fruit or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Chriſts death, but prior to it, and Chriſt's death follows as a mean to make it effectual; He is appointed to ſave the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from their ſins, and from that which their ſins deſerved. <hi>For the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſtricken;</hi> They were God's people by Election before Chriſt's ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſuffer and ſatisfie for them, much more before his actual ſuffering, and ſo their Election cannot be a fruit and effect of his ſuffering.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> It ſerves to vindicate this truth from an error and miſtake of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> who, as they overthrow the deſign of grace in the ſalvation of ſinners in other ſteps thereof; So do they in this, in making Chriſt's death to preceed Election, and Election to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; But, as we hinted before, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Election is Soveraign, being an Act of Grace abſolutely free, the Lord in it having deſigned ſome for manifeſting the glory of his grace upon them as the end, he hath taken in Chriſts death and other midſes for the promoving of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is implyed here, that even the Elect or God's People are conſidered as ſinful in the Covenant of Redemption, <hi>For the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of my people was he ſtricken;</hi> They were conſidered as ſinful as well as others when they were bargained for: We need not here diſpute whether they were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ſinful in the Decree of Election, it not being neceſſary in this place, nor profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for you, but ſure in Chriſt's underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for them they are conſidered as ſinful; for God ſent not Chriſt, neither came he into the world to purchaſe life and ſalvation to righteous folks, but he was ſent and came to lay down his life <hi>a ranſome for many,</hi> to wit ſinners, and therefore it is given as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Name, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. It ſerves to humble the Elect greatly, who, when ever they come to get grace, they get it moſt freely, for they were no better by nature than others whom God paſt by, as is clear, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>We were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, and were by nature children of wrath even as others; Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were by nature children of wrath as well as <hi>Judas;</hi> And <hi>David</hi> was a child of wrath by nature as well as <hi>Saul,</hi> when this tranſaction concerning the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was agreed upon and concluded betwixt theſe moſt reſponſal Parties.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It ſerves alſo much for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Believer who is ſenſible of ſin, and afraid of wrath, and in that poſture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to Chriſt for refuge; though his misbelief ſhould make him ſay with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Depart from me, for I am a ſinful man, O Lord,</hi> yet this conſideration may hearten him to draw near, that Chriſt was <hi>ſtricken</hi> for ſinners, for the tranſgreſſions of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect people; yea, if t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere had not been ſin, and if the Covenant of Works had hold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n foot, there needed not to have been a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and therefore ſinners have here a ſolid ground to lay hold upon for life and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>And therefore as a 3d. <hi>Uſe</hi> of it, it is an unſafe aſſertion, beſide the curioſity of it, that <hi>Antinomians</hi> maintain, which is, that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:152256:137"/> though man had never fallen, yet Chriſt would have become Man; For we ſee here, that Chriſts becoming Man, and his being ſtricken, flowed from his being Surety for Elect ſinners; and his being Surety flowed from the Covenant of Redemption concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Elect ſinners: To be wiſe without, or beſide and above what is written in the Scriptures, it's vanity, pride and folly.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is implyed here, that ſin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is deſerves ſtroaks, even the ſin of the Elect; Yea we may add this to it, that not only do the ſins of the Elect deſerve ſtroaks in themſelves, being breaches of God's Law, but that there is an actual curſe ſtanding againſt them till it be removed; And God's threatning, <hi>The day thou eats thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> infers a neceſſity of ſtroaks; This we ſay is clearly implyed here, becauſe the Mediator entering himſelf Surety for the Elects debt behoved to be ſmitten, and when he was ſo ſmitten, ſure ſin muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve much; We ſpeak not of an abſolute neceſſity, but God having revealed to man his duty, and added a threatning, that in the day he ſhould eat he ſhould die, there is a neceſſity in reſpect of God's truth, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and unchangeableneſs who had ſpoken the word, that ſtroaks ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſin, for ſin cannot be removed till the threatning be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> This may point out to us that ſin is no little nor light thing, neither is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of pardon any eaſie buſineſs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men generally think of them; There are many ſad ſtroaks that follow ſin, which will hotly purſue ſinners who are not in Chriſt; O! do not then think lightly of ſin which is the Fountain of ſo much miſery and woe to the ſinner; If ye knew how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly bitter wrath and the curſe is that fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lows ſin, ye would as ſoon put your head in the fire as ye would meddle with it; If ye believed that word to be true which is in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34 <hi>He will by no means clear the guilty;</hi> And if ye believed God's faithfulneſs that is ingaged to make good his threatnings, challenges for ſin would be more ſtrong and ſtinging.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is implyed here, that though the Elects ſins deſerve wrath, and that there muſt be a ſatisfaction ere they can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, that yet the Elect cannot ſatisfie for themſelves, <hi>For the tranſgreſſions of my people was he ſtricken;</hi> Chriſt behoved to be ſmitten ere their ſin could be removed; If the Elect could have done their own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs they needed not to have been ſo much in Chriſts common and debt, nor to have given him thanks for his undertaking; But this is brought in to hold forth the conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of his love, that when no other thing could do it, he interpoſed as Surety; The abominableneſs of ſin was ſo great, that the Majeſty of God his infinite Holineſs and his ſpotleſs Juſtice being wronged, and the finite Creature not being able to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the wrong done, did require this; For all mankind, yea all the Holy Angels could not ſatisfie for the wrong done by one man to the infinite God, therefore he ſayes, <hi>I am the Saviour, and there is none elſe;</hi> He gives defiance to all Saviours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide himſelf, <hi>None can redeem his brothers ſoul from death, nor give a price ſufficient for it, the redemption of it ceaſeth for ever</hi> among the Creatures.</p>

               <hi>Uſe.</hi> Study then to be ſuitably ſenſible of this; ye may poſſibly think it to be but a common Doctrine, but alaee ye walk not under the due and deep conviction and ſenſe of it, hence it comes to paſs that ſo few think themſelves in Chriſts common, and that ſo few make their addreſs to him: Ask the moſt part how they think they will win to Heaven? They will readily name many things and wayes ere they light on Chriſt and Faith in him; If they have done a fault they ſay they will make a-mends, or they will pray for pardon, and they think that will do the turn: Such have this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in effect, that either there is no need of ſatisfaction for ſin, or that they can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for themſelves.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is implyed here, that though the Elect have ſinned, and cannot ſatisfie for themſelves, yet it is neceſſary that a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction be provided for them; I do not ſay ſimply that whoever hath ſinned muſt have a ſatisfaction made for them; For the Lord

            <p n="7">7. It's implyed here, that for this end, to wit, that the Elect might be ſaved from ſin, and that Gods Decree of Election might ſtand ſure, Chriſt Jeſus became Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and did undertake to ſatisfie for their ſins; otherwiſe he could not have been lyable to be ſtricken for them, if he had not become Surety for them; That he was for the tranſgreſſion of God's people ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſayes plainly that he was ingaged for them, as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. <hi>He was made Surety of a better Teſtament;</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7. <hi>Then ſaid I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me: I delight to do thy will, O my God:</hi> Theſe things being ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after the manner of, and borrowed from, the bargainings or tranſactions that uſe to be amongſt men, we may conceive the buſineſs thus, (hinted before) there is the Fathers refuſing of ſomewhat, <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s that Chriſt in his undertaking for the Elect did oblidge himſelf to undergo all theſe ſufferings that were due to them, and even the ſuffering of a curſed death, which was the curſe threatned againſt man for ſin, <hi>The day thou eats thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> And though Chriſt becoming Surety and Cautioner, the Party is altered, yet the price is ſtill continued to be the ſame, as is clear, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>He was made a curſe for us, that the bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:152256:138"/> on us Gentiles;</hi> Whereby the Juſtice of God is vindicat, and he hath acceſs to ſhew mercy to the Elect without any the leaſt imputation to it; Nay, this way is more for the vindicating of God's Juſtice, and for the making of his faithfulneſs to ſhine, that Chriſt became Man, and died for the Elect, than if the curſe had lighted and lyen on all the Elect themſelves, and it is a greater aw-band on ſinners againſt ſin: I ſay again, that hereby the pure and ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Juſtice of God is more vindicated, and hIs faithfulneſs more demonſtrated, when he will needs ſo ſeverely, and with ſo much holy rigidity exact of the Cautioner the Elects debt to the leaſt farthing, then if they had ſuffered themſelves eternally; It ſhews forth alſo, both the manifold wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and the riches of the free grace of God, there being a Decree of Election for ſaving ſo many, and for bringing them to Glory; And they being under ſin, there is another decree and threatning that goes forth for curſing the ſinner, and theſe two ſeeming to be altogether irreconciliable, the Queſtion comes in on the one hand, how is it poſſible that a ſinner under the curſe can be ſaved? And upon the other hand, how is it poſſible that an Elect of God can be damned? The wiſdome of God looſeth the knot; Spotleſs Juſtice is ſatisfied by taking hold of, and falling on the Cautioner: Wonderful Grace and Love vent themſelves in pardoning the ſinner, and in accepting of a ranſome for him; And manifold wiſdome manifeſts it ſelf in knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe two together, ſo as none of them can want its effect; But all returns to the manifeſtation of the Glory of Grace in the up-ſhot; It cannot be that the Elect ſhall be damned; Yet here ſtands the threatning of a juſt God, and his curſe ready to be execute, but here is the reconciliation; The curſe is execute on the Mediator; whereby God ſhews himſelf to be a hater of ſin, and an avenger of the wrong done to his Juſtice; And the Elect ſinner is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, whereby God manifeſteth the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his grace, and his wonderfully condeſcending love.</p>
            <p>But now we come to a 9th <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which is more directly held forth in the words, and it hath two Branches, that our Lord Jeſus his death and ſufferings is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable price and ſatisfaction laid down for the ſins of the Elect, and for them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; This is in the expreſs words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; If the Queſtion be aſked, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffered Chriſt all this? He anſwers, he ſuffered it as a price for tranſgreſſion; If it be aſked again for whom, or for whoſe tranſgreſſion did he ſuffer? He anſwers, not for all Men and Women in the World, but <hi>for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he stricken,</hi> or the ſtroak was on him for their tranſgreſſions; The firſt Branch of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is to this purpoſe, that Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering is intended to ſatisfie for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of Gods elected people, and with reſpect to ſatisfying for their ſins did he ſuffer: And if we take theſe to be truths that we marked before, as implyed in the words, this will natively and neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; If he engaged to be Cautioner and Surety for the Elects debt, then his laying down his life muſt be on the ſame account, and for the ſame end; Now, when we ſpeak of Chriſts laying down a price to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for the tranſgreſſions of the Elect, we mean not only this, that his ſufferings and death have a value in themſelves to ſatisfie for their ſins, but that they are ſo intended by him in undergoing of them, and that they are ſo accepted of God according to his purpoſe, and according to the tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that paſt betwixt Jehovah and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator: They are not only (as <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay) to be a confirmation of the Doctrine which he preached, and to be a rule and example to us of patient ſuffering, and of giving obedience to the death, as he did; But it's alſo and mainly to ſatisfie the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God for our debt; So then this wicked Tenet of the <hi>Socinians</hi> is exceeding derogatory to the ſufferings of Chriſt, and to the matchleſs love that ſhined in them, yea, and even to the whole deſign of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For if Chriſts ſufferings be not a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Juſtice, we are left without all juſt plea and apology for our ſelves at Gods
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:152256:138"/> Bar, and if we have none, then that curſe looks the wakened ſinner full in the face, <hi>The day thou eats thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> And however men in their ſecurity may pleaſe themſelves with ſuch dreams, and think that a ſatisfaction to Juſtice is not needful, yet if the conſcience be once wakened, it will not be quieted without one; And if mens Faith give not credit to Gods threatnings, they can have but little, or rather no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at all in his promiſes; There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a neceſſity of a ſatisfaction, and if Chriſts ſufferings be not the ſatisfaction, there is not another, and ſo the whole work of Redemption is overturned; So then, though Chriſt in his ſufferings hath left us a Copy how we ſhould ſuffer, yet that is not the only nor the principal end of them; but it is contrived in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and intended by the Medi tor, and withall accepted by Jehovah, that they ſhould be the meritorious cauſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing pardon to the Elect, and the price of their Redemption.</p>
            <p>This may be further cleared and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1. From the phraſe that is ordinarily made uſe of in Scripture, <hi>He ſuffered for the ſins</hi> of his people; And in the Text, <hi>For the tranſgreſſion of my people was he stricken;</hi> Their ſins had a peculiar influence in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtroak on him; And what influence I pray could they have but as they procured the ſtroak to him? And if his ſtroaks were procured by our ſins, then the deſert of them was laid on him, and his ſufferings behoved to be the curſe that we elect ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould have ſuffered; So when he is called their Cautioner, it tells that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook their debt, and his laying down of his life is the performance and fulfilling of his undertaken Suretyſhip and Cautionry; And conſidering that their debt was exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him, and that he was arraigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods Tribunal as their Surety in their room, and that this could be for nothing elſe but to anſwer for them as being their Cautioner; His ſufferings behoved to be intended as a ſatisfaction for their ſins; For the Elects ſins were not the cauſe why <hi>Pilate,</hi> the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Scribes and Phariſees purſued him to death, but for our ſins he was ſiſted before God's Tribunal, and being our Cautioner he was called to reckon for them, and they were put upon his account or ſcore. 2. It's clear alſo from the names that his ſufferings get in the Scripture, where they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>price of our Redemption,</hi> a <hi>buying</hi> of us, a <hi>propitiation</hi> for our ſins that pacified God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. A <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> often and <hi>Ranſome,</hi> Matth. 20.28. <hi>The Son of man came to give his life a ranſome for many,</hi> that is, for all his Elect people, to relieve them from the bondage they were under; which plainly ſhews the reſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct that his ſufferings had to our ſins, that they were a propitiation for them to God. 3. It's clear, if we conſider that Chriſts death as to its object is for the tranſgreſſions of all Gods people, of all the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ect that lived before he ſuffered, whether they died in their infancy or at age, and for all that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or ſhall live and die after his ſuffering, to the end of the world; Now, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite could redound to them that died ere Chriſt came in the fleſh by his ſufferings, if it were as <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay? for his death could not ſure be a pattern of patience and obedience to them: But the efficacy of his death was from the beginning of the world; He was ſtill in that ſenſe the Lamb ſlain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Incarnation, as well as ſince: And if it be not meritorious in procuring Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Elect Infants, what influence or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage can it have as to them? Either they are not taken to Heaven at all; or they are taken to Heaven and yet not in the leaſt obliged to Chriſt for their being brought thither; or if they be obliged to him, it is certainly by vertue of the merit of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for expiating the ſins of his people. 4. It's clear from this, that in this ſame <hi>Chapter</hi> and throughout the Goſpel, all the benefits that come to Gods people, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Juſtification and pardon of ſin, they are attributed to this as the cauſe of them, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant justifie many;</hi> And if all the ſpiritual benefits that come to us were procured by his death, there muſt neceſſarily be vertue
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:152256:139"/> in it that procured them, and it muſt be a price and ſatisfaction in reference to the procuring and purchaſing thereof, that he laid down in his dying. 5. It is clear from the end that God had before him in the work of Redemption, and in Chriſt's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; which was to glorify his Juſtice as well as his Mercy, and that neither of them might be clouded or reflected upon; now, by Chriſt's death God's Juſtice is glorified, and he is ſeen to be juſt in executing his threatning againſt ſin, even in the perſon of his own dearly beloved Son when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Surety for ſinners; but if his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings had not a ſatisfaction in them to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, though there might be ſome ſhew of ſhewing Mercy, yet none at all of a ſatisfaction to Juſtice; but ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>God hath ſet him forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs, and that he might be juſt and the justifier of them which believe in Jeſus?</hi> by this, God hath made it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that he is a juſt God, that none may prepoſterouſly preſume upon Mercy, nor dare to bourd with ſin when it is purſued in the Surety with ſuch ſeverity:</p>
            <p>For <hi>Uſe</hi> and Application, 1. Do not think theſe truths to be of little concernment to you, as alace they and ſuch like truths of the Goſpel are often thought of by many, and therefore they are taſteleſs to them, and it's a wearineſs to people to hear them ſpoken of; and yet notwithſtanding, this ſame truth that we are now upon, is a great ground of our faith; for if we believe not this, that Chriſt was a propitiation for ſin, we can have no ground of lippening to him, or believing on him; but knowing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confirmed in the faith of this truth, we have (cordially cloſing with him) ground from it to expect God's favour and to be fred from the curſe; becauſe Chriſt as our Surety undertook and accordingly ſatisfied for us; which is the thing that makes his death to be ſweet; that Chriſt in his death ſhould demit himſelf to leave us an example, is much, yet if we had no more by it, it would be but cold comfort, except we had it as a ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice to reſt upon: Though this may be looked upon as doctrinal only, yet it comes nearer to our practice then we are aware of; and though we have not <hi>Socinians</hi> in opinion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to deal with; yet we have two ſorts that are <hi>Socinians</hi> in heart amongſt us. 1. Theſe that ſecurely ſin on ſtill, and yet hope to get mercy, and who will confeſs that they are ſinners, but that for making an amends they will pray and mend their life, and they will ſpeak of a number of things, but it may be, not one word of Chriſt or of his purchaſe, or of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclination to preſume and to ſlight Chriſt, as if they had nothing yet to look to but a Covenant of works without a Saviour, or as if God had removed or would remove the curſe threatned without a ſatisfaction; ſo that Chriſts ſatisfaction is not known nor reſted on by the multitude of Hypocrites that live in the viſible Church; and this is eaſily proven from this, that there are but very few who make uſe of him or ſtand in awe to ſin; if it were believed that Juſtice required and will have ſatisfaction either of the ſinner himſelf or of a ſurety in his room, and that Chriſt is the only Surety, Folks would either quite their hopes of Heaven, or be more in Chriſts common; and that ſo many mantain the hope of Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a due conſideration of a ſatisfaction to Juſtice by Chriſt, and without employing of him, it declares plainly that they are drunken with this error. A 2d. ſort are theſe who being wakened in Conſcience and ſenſible of ſin, yet are as heartleſs, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitating and hopeleſs to get peace through him, as if he had not ſatisfied; what elſe does the doubting and deſpondency of ſuch ſay, but that there is not a compleat ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in Chriſt's death? and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they dare not truſt to it, otherwiſe they would wonder that God hath provided ſuch a remedy, and yet adventure to reſt upon it, ſeing God is as well pleaſed with it as if they had not provocked him at all, or had ſatisfied his Juſtice themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. It ſerves to let us ſee what we are in God's common and debt, and how much we are obliged to the Mediator; when
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:152256:139"/> there was a neceſſity that either he ſhould ſuffer or that we ſhould periſh; and that though his ſufferings drew ſo deep as to bring him <hi>to priſon and to judgment,</hi> and to put him to a holy ſinleſs anxiety and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, that yet he yielded to it and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent all for our ſakes; this is our great ground of confidence, and the ſtrong ſtay of the mind of a wakened Believer: And ſhould make us wonder at the Fathers love that gave the ſon, and at the Sons love that was ſo condeſcending, and ſhould make our ſouls warm towards him, who, when we deſerved nothing but to be hurried away to the Pit, was content to enter himſelf as our Surety, and to pay our Debt: It ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be a motive to chaſe ſouls in to him, knowing that where ſin is, there a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction muſt be, and that there is therefore a neceſſity to fly to him and to be in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no other way to get Juſtice ſatisfied; the through conviction whereof is that which through grace not only chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſoul to, but engageth it to cloſe with Chriſt and to reſt upon him, and to give him the credit of its thorow-bearing when it is ready otherwiſe to ſink: Now the Lord himſelf teach you to make this uſe of this Doctrine.</p>

            <p>THere is nothing that concerns us more than to be well acquainted with the doctrine of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and his Sufferings; The Prophet hath therefore been much in ſhewing what Chriſt ſuffered in the former words, and hath largely deſcribed his Humiliation to Judgment and Death, <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he was cut off out of the land of the living:</hi> In the words read he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers two important queſtions concerning his ſufferings, 1. To what end were all theſe ſufferings? he anſwers that they were for tranſgreſſions, even to be a ſatisfaction to Juſtice for them. The 2. Queſtion is, For whoſe ſins were the ſufferings of Chriſt to be a ſatisfaction? It is anſwered expreſly in the words, <hi>for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſtricken,</hi> or the ſtroak was upon him; it was for the ſins of the Elect, and of the Elect only, for this is the Prophets ſcope, who, having ſpoken of Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and death, holds forth the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and procuring cauſe and end thereof; and this is the reſult, deſign and ſum of all, even to be a ſatisfaction for Gods elect People; for (as we ſhew) by Gods People are not meaned all men in the world, nor the <hi>Jews</hi> only, for Chriſt hath many ſheep beſide them; but it's Gods peculiar People in oppoſition to the multitude who are not his People.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine, or rather the branch of the Doctrine we left at, was this (and it's excluſive) that Chriſt's death is only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be a price for the ſins of God's elect People and was laid down with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them; his death and ſufferings are to be looked upon, and conſidered only as a price and ſatisfaction for their ſins, and for the ſins of none other; or thus, Jeſus Chriſt in his ſuffering and in the laying down of his life; had a reſpect to the elect, and intended the removing of the ſins and tranſgreſſions of God's elect people only, and of none other; we know nothing that we can make of theſe words, nor of the Prophets ſcope in them but this; who as he hath been deſcribing Chriſts ſufferings in all other reſpects, ſo doth he in this; to wit, in reſpect of the perſons for whom he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and of the meritorious cauſe and end of his ſufferings; for ſays the Text, <hi>for the tranſgreſſions of my people,</hi> that is of Gods elect people <hi>was he ſtricken.</hi>

            <p>This branch of the Doctrine is of great weight and concernment in the whole ſtrain of Grace, for if this march-ſtone be lifted
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:152256:140"/> and removed, Grace becomes common, and as ſome call it, <hi>univerſal,</hi> and ſo to be in effect no grace at all; for Grace hath a peculiar channel of its own wherein it runs towards a certain ſelect number and not towards all: I do not mean of grace taken in a large ſenſe, for ſo all men as they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of any mercy, or of common favours, may be ſaid to have grace extended to them; but I mean, God's ſpecial grace, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and good will which is extended only to the Elect for whoſe ſins Chriſt ſuffered; the right bounding of which Doctrine ſhews forth both God's ſoveraignty in the diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of grace, and the freeneſs thereof in communicating and manifeſting of it to whom he will, and which thus conſidered is eſpecially engaging of the hearts of them on whom he pleaſeth to manifeſt it.</p>
            <p>Ere I come to confirm this branch of the Doctrine, take a word or two of advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the entry. 1. That Chriſt's death may be conſidered <hi>two</hi> ways, 1. In reſpect of it ſelf, and as abſtracting from the Covenant of Redemption wherein it is contrived as to all the circumſtances of it; in which ſenſe as his death and ſufferings are of infinite value &amp; worth, ſo they are (as Divines uſe to ſpeak) of value to redeem the whole world, if God in his deſign and decree had ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and thought meet to extend it. 2. We are to conſider his ſufferings and death as a price agreed upon in the Covenant or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of Redemption, wherein theſe two or three things concur. 1. God's propoſal. 2. Chriſt's acceptation and deſign in laying down his life. 3. The Fathers acquieſcing therein and declaring himſelf well pleaſed therewith; we ſpeak not here of Chriſt's death in the firſt reſpect, that is as abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Covenant, for in that reſpect he might have laid down his life for few or moe, for ſome or for all, if it had been ſo intended; but we ſpeak of it in the ſecond reſpect, as it's a price agreed upon in God's purpoſe and Chriſt's deſign and in God's acceptation; and thus we ſay, that his death is only intended as a ſatisfaction and recompence for the ſins of the Elect, and was laid down for them only.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. We may conſider Chriſt's ſufferings and death in the fruits of it, either as they reſpect common favours and mercies, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts and means of grace which are not peculiar and ſaving, but common to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers with others, being beſtowed upon profeſſors in the viſible Church; or as they are peculiar and ſaving, ſuch as Faith, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, when we ſay, that Chriſt's ſufferings and death, are a price for the ſins of his People, we exclude not the Reprobate ſimply from temporal and common favours and mercies that come by his death; they may have and actually have common gifts and works of the Spirit, the means of Grace, which are ſome way effects and fruits of the ſame Covenant, but we ſay, that the Reprobate partake not of ſaving Mercy, and that Chriſts death is a ſatisfaction only for the Elect, and that none others get pardon of Sin, Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by it, but they only, it was intended for none others, and this we clear and confirm from, and by theſe following grounds and arguments, which we ſhall ſhortly hint at.</p>
            <p>The 1. Argument is drawen from this ſame aſſertion of the Prophet, thus, If Chriſts death be only a ſatisfaction for the ſins of Gods People, then it is not a ſatisfaction for the ſins of all, but it's a ſatisfaction only for the ſins of Gods People, therefore not for all, for his People are not all men, or all men are not his People, but his People are a peculiar People ſeparate from others in God's purpoſe and decree, as we cleared before from <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>Thine they were and thou gaveſt them me</hi> and the Text ſays ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>for the tranſgreſſions of my people was he ſtricken;</hi> he reſpected the ſins of God's People in accepting of the Bargain, and in laying down his Life, and for their ſins only God accepted him; yea, the very mentioning of them thus here, ſecludes all others; and we muſt expone them excluſively as taking in none others, and muſt look upon the things ſpoken of them as agreeing to no other; even as it's ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>There remains therefore a reſt to the people of God,</hi> which is certainly excluſive of all others; and hence,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:152256:141"/> when our Lord ſpeaks of them <hi>John</hi> 17. he oppoſeth them to, and contradiſtinguiſheth them from all others, <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, buy for them that thou haſt given me out of the world,</hi> to let us know that the things, prayed for to the one are denied to the other according to the ſtrain of the Coven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

In the Covenant of Redemption the good of the Elect is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and deſigned by the Father, as is clear <hi>John</hi> 6.39, 40. <hi>This is the Fathers will that ſent me, that of all which he hath given me I ſhould loſe nothing; and this is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son and believeth on him may have everlaſting life:</hi> which will be the more clear if we conſider the time when this is ſpoken it's at ſuch a time when many will not come to him and bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Look on the Son's ſide of the Covenant, and it will alſo be clear, for his undertaking muſt be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Fathers propoſing; if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not propoſe all but ſome only to be redeemed, then his undertaking muſt be for theſe ſome and not for all, conform to the Fathers propoſal, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>Then ſaid I, lo, I come to do thy will O my God;</hi> now, the Fathers will is, that the ſhould undertake for theſe given him, and it's not his will that he ſhould, undertake for others, therefore he did not undertake for them. 3. Chriſts ſufferings and death are the execution of the Fathers will, and therefore muſt be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his undertaking according to his engagement for the Elect and given ones, therefore theſe two are put together, <hi>John</hi> 17.9. and 19. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me: and, for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf,</hi> that is for their ſakes whom thou haſt given me and not for the world; He ſancrifies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for them for whom he prays, for them that are given him and no more.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. This is clear in the Covenant, that Chriſts death is intended there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n as all other Mercies covenanted, are; that is to ſay, to whom Faith Effectual Calling, Juſtification, &amp;c. are covenanted, for theſe is Chriſt's death covenanted, and for none others; for the Covenant being mutual, the reprom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſion on the Fathers part muſt be of equal extent with the Son's ſtipulation, but all theſe are only peculiarly applicable to the Elect, as benefites flowing from, and following upon Chriſt's death, which therefore muſt be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly intended for them as being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone for them; hence when Chriſt ſpeaks of Faith and Effectual Calling, <hi>John</hi> 6. he ſays <hi>All that the Father hath given me ſhall come unto me,</hi> and none other will nor can come; ſo Juſtification, Pardon of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are bought to the Elect and to none others; and when the ſmalleſt of bleſſings are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted and articled for none other but for the Elect, ſhall Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, <hi>that gift of God,</hi> or his death, which is the chief thing articled in the Covenant, be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted for or applyed to any others but to them?</p>

            <p>A 4th. ground is this, Chriſt's death is one of the peculiar evidences of his de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reſt love, beyond which there is none greater, and a main proof and fruit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thereof, and therefore is not common to all, but is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for them only whom he peculiarly loves and deſigns to bring through to glory; which is clear <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Husbands love your wives as Chriſt loved his Church and gave himſelf for it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. <hi>God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends his love to us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us;</hi> John 15.13. <hi>Greater love hath no man then this, that a man ſhould lay down his life for his friends;</hi> there is a world of Reprobates whom Chriſt never loved with peculiar love, and ſure for theſe he did not die; <hi>Jacob have I loved but Eſau have I hated,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13. which the Apoſtle holdeth forth as a ſort of copy of God's dealing in reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and election in reference to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and where the Lord himſelf hath ſet bounds betwixt them whom he loves and hates, it's too great liberality, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too great preſumption for any, under whatever ſpecious pretences, to extend this his peculiar love to theſe whom he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims.</p>
            <p>A 5th. ground is taken from the effect, thus, All for whom Chriſt died, are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and freed from the guilt of their ſins in due time, but Chriſt Jeſus hath not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and actually procured freedom to all men from their ſins; all men be not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, therefore he laid not down his life for all; For, 1. It cannot be ſaid that he laid down his life for purchaſing and buying of ſuch wares, and yet that he got not that which he bought; and ſeing the event tells plainly that all are not juſtified and brought to Heaven, it cannot be that he laid down his life a Ranſom for all, but it muſt be for the Elect only that he died. 2. To ſay that God exacts double payment of one and the ſelf ſame De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts from men over again that which Chriſt payed already for them reflects on the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Wiſdom of God; and to ſay that a perſon that goes to hell ſhall be no leſs in his common then another that goes to Heaven, is no leſs abſurd; for the Apoſtle ſays <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>If while we were enemies we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his life:</hi> where he plainly inſinuates, that if a perſon be bought by Chriſts death, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that he can periſh; for if the price be payed by his death, and ſo the greater thing be done, much more will the leſſer, <hi>we ſhall be ſaved by his life;</hi> now this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning could have no force, if Chriſt died for any that ſhall periſh; yea <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. of this Chapter it's ſaid, <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many for he ſhall bear their iniquities;</hi> where it's clear, that as many (and no mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) whoſe iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Chriſt hath taken on and born, ſhall be juſtified; for the one is given as a reaſon of the other; and there ſhould be no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to his juſtifying of them, from his bearing of their iniquitries, if he could by his death bear their iniquities whom he never juſtified.</p>
            <p>A 6th. ground is taken from the end of the Covenant, which is to put a difference betwixt ſpecial Grace peculiar to ſome, and ſevere Juſtice to others, and particularly and eſpecially in Chriſts death, which makes out what we affirm; for if when Chriſt died many were actually damned, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid that he died for theſe; not that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:152256:142"/> it was with them as with Believers before his death; for it cannot he ſaid that the intention of his death in the Covenant, could be beyond what it was at his death, the one being the execution of the other; And ſure it could not be intended at his death for the damned; For it would ſeem a very abſurd thing to ſay, that when Chriſt was to go and lay down his life, that he was going to ſuffer for many that were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for their own ſins in Hell, as many reprobat ſinners were before he came in the fleſh; Can any imagine a poſſibility of ſuch a thing? Our Lord was not to be ſo indifferent in the adminiſtration of Grace, as to caſt it thus away; And can any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably think, that at one and the ſame time, the ſame puniſhment ſhall be exacted from Chriſt, and from the perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for whom he ſuffered? It is poſſible that this could be intended in the Covenant of Redemption; Or is there free acceſs to Juſtice to purſue? Chriſt as Cautioner when the Principal Debtor is actually ſiezed u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon? Indeed when the Principal is ſet free as the Elect were before his death, there is acceſs to purſue the Cautioner for their debt; But no ſuch thing can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for others that were already dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; But their being taken hold of by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, is a proof that he anſwered not for them, nor payed their debt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We may argue thus, If Chriſt died for all, then either for all indifferently, and ſo all were alike obliged to Chriſt; Or for ſome more abſolutely that muſt be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for, and for others conditionally on ſuppoſition that they ſhould believe; But this laſt is abſurd, for 1. The Scripture makes not two conſiderations of Chriſts death. 2. It were abſurd to ſay that now it cannot be told whether Chriſt died for ſuch an one or not. 3. Either that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is bought to them, or not; If it be bought, then it muſt be fulfilled (If it be not bought, then 1. That perſon cannot be ſaid to be bought, becauſe all needful for his Redemption is not bought and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. 2. Either that condition can be fulfilled by themſelves or not, if it may be by themſelves, then is Free-will eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and none are abſolutely redeemed; If it cannot be fulfilled by themſelves, and yet bought by him for them, then they are determined for another end, to wit, not to get it, and what wiſdom can there be in ſuch a Redemption as this?</p>
            <p>The 1. <hi>Uſe</hi> ſerves for clearing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of a Goſpel truth of the Covenant of Redemption, and for the refutation of a contrary error; As we have ſomewhat of many errors practically in our hearts, ſo have we this amongſt the reſt, that Chriſt died for all ſinners; which foſters peoples ſecurity, and their groundleſs hope of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Heaven; But here we ſee that our Lord Jeſus in laying down his life, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſatisfaction of Divine Juſtice for none but for his Elect people, and if ſo, there are many for whom he never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the benefite of his death; There are <hi>three</hi> particular Branches of the error which this Doctrine confutes; 1. Their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which is more lax, and takes in the ſins of all men and women in the world, and giveth them an equal ſhare in Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; as if in his intention in laying down of his life, and in Gods purpoſe he had ſuffered and died for all, for him that goes to Hell as well as for him that goes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; But if Chriſt ſtand as Cautioner for the Elect only, then ſure this opinion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold; for all are not Gods Elect; And therefore all are not indifferently redeemed: And though it may be that ſome of you think that this looks liker grace, yet its not only abſurd as being contrary to truth, but its abſurd alſo even with reſpect to grace; For 1. It makes grace a common thing, a man that is in Hell to be as much obliged to Chriſt as one that is in Heaven; And though it plauſibly pretends to give grace abroad and large extent, yet it takes away the power of it; For if grace be thus largely extended, it's not grace that makes the application of grace, but the free will of the Creature; For grace according to this opinion, leaves men to be ſaved or not as they pleaſe, and leaves it ſelf to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by mans will; And therefore theſe
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:152256:142"/> errours divide not, but go together hand in hand; For where grace is made ſo large, free-will is made to have a dominion over it, and thus the weight of grace and of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are laid upon it. 2. It leſſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the eſtimation of Gods grace in the minds of people; for thus, they think little of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſuppoſe that it is an eaſie matter to win at it, and it breeds in them a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs of Hell and of Gods Wrath: And if many of you had not drunken in this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour practically, ye would not be ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of, nor ſo obſtinatly maintain your hope of Heaven without ground; Hence alace it is, that many will ſay, God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and Chriſt died for all ſinners, and for me, and ſo ſleep it out in ſecurity; I am perſwaded that much of the ſecurity and preſumption that abounds among carnal Profeſſors is from this ground, that grace is fancied to be thus broad and large; We grant that as to the convey and nature of it it's broad, but in reſpect of the objects on whom it is beſtowed, it's narrow, though it cometh from large bowels. 3. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly marrs and diminiſheth mens thankfulneſs, for when a mercy is judged to be common, who will praiſe for it as he would do if it were ſpecial and peculiar? That which is a great ground of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Election, Effectual Calling, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is becauſe theſe mercies are peculiar; even ſo that which makes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed thankful for Redemption, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are redeemed and bought when others are left, hence is that Song of the redeemed company, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Thou art worthy to open the Book, for thou waſt ſtain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kind ed, and tongue, and people, and nation;</hi> It hightens not their praiſe that all of every kindred, and tongue, and nation were redeemed, but this doth it that when the Lord had the whole world before him, he was graciouſly pleaſed to purchaſe and redeem them out of it, that as it is, <hi>John</hi> 11.52. <hi>He ſhould gather together in one the children of God that were ſcattered abroad;</hi> They therefore I ſay bleſs him, and wonder when they conſider that they are pitched on who are by nature the ſame with theſe that are paſt by: &amp; were a ſtrange thing to affirm that they who are in Hell have as great ground of praiſe, and of ſaying, <hi>We thank thee, for thou hast redeemed as by thy blood,</hi> as theſe that are in Heaven have. 4. This making of grace ſo wide and large in his extent as to take in all; doth leave the people of God altogether comfortleſs. But it may be here ſaid, How is it that it is more comfort to Believers that grace is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar in ſaving, and that but a few are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed in compariſon of others that are not redeemed, then if we ſhould extend it unto, and account it to be for all? Or how is this more comfortleſs to them, that grace is made univerſal? Anſwer 1. Becauſe if it were univerſal, many whom Chriſt died for, are now in Hell, and what conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can there be from that? A man may be redeemed and yet periſh and go to Hell for all that? But it's ſtrong conſolation when this comes in, <hi>If when we were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies we were reconciled by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his life,</hi> If he died for us when we were enemies, will he not much more ſave us being friends? 2. Suppoſe a perſon to be in black nature, what comfort could he have by looking on Redemption as univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal? He could not expect Heaven by it; for many expect Heaven on that ground who will never get it; But it's a ſort of conſolation even to them that are without, to conſider that Redemption is peculiar to ſome; For though all get not Heaven, yet they that believe get it, and ſo upon their cloſing with Chriſt the conſolation preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flows out unto them; Whereas if they ſhould lay it for a ground that Chriſts death were univerſal, they could never have ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid ground of conſolation by flying to him. 5. This errour doth quite overturn and enervat the whole Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and peculiar love. 1. It enervats and obſcures the wiſdome that ſhines in it, if Chriſt may buy and purchaſe many by his death, who ſhall yet notwithſtanding pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. 2.

It obſcures the Juſtice of it, if he ſhould but all and yet get but ſom for it being the deſign of God to inflict on Chriſt the curſe that was due to ſinners, and to ſpare them; if this ſhould be the reſult of it that many for whom he died and took on him the curſe, ſhould p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and it is Juſtice that it ſhould be ſo. We do the rather inſiſt in the refutation of this errour, becauſe this is a time wherein it is one of the Devils, great deſigns which he drives to trouble the clear Springs of the Goſpel, and to revive this errour amongſt the reſt; And there is ſomething of it in theſe poor fool Bodies who ſpeak ſo much of a light within, as if all were alike, and had ſomething, which if they uſe well they may get life by; This error alwayes leaves men to be Maſters and Carvers of Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and of Chriſts purpoſe and deſign in the work of Redemption, and ſuſpends the benefit of his death mainly, if not only on the conſent of mans free-will.</p>
            <p>A 2d. Branch of the errour which this Doctrine refutes, is that which is vented by ſome who are not profeſſed enemies, but in other things deſerve well of the Church of Chriſt, which therefore ſhould be our grief to mention; And it is this, that though Chriſt hath not ſimply purchaſed Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from ſin to all men, that yet he hath taken away from all, the ſins of that firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, as if there were (as they ſay) no ſin for which men are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but the ſin of infidelity or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; But this is dangerous for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. If this be true that Chriſt's death is only a price for the ſins of the Elect, then there are no ſins of others reckoned on his ſcore. 2. It halveth Chriſts purchaſe, and hardly will we find Chriſts death divided, which were to ſay that he hath bought a man in part or ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f, from wrath and not wholly, ſuch a dividing of Chriſt, and halving of his death, ſeems not conſiſtent with the ſtrain of the Goſpel, for as there is one Sacrifice, ſo there is one account on which it is offered. 3. It ſeems to infer a good and ſafe condition to all them that die without ſinning againſt the Goſpel, and ſo to Infants born out of the Church that never ſinned againſt the Covenant of Grace, and it pleads much for them that never heard the Goſpel, yea poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly for all, if they be not obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel, as it's hard to ſay they are, who never heard of it. 4. There are many in hell this day who know and feel this to be an untruth, being condemned for ſins againſt the Covenant of Works, therefore he undertook not their debt, nor payed for them; And when the Books ſhall be caſt open, there will be many other ſins ſound to be reckoned for then ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel; Are not Whoremongers, Adulterers, Murtherers, Thieves, <hi>&amp;c</hi> to to reckon for theſe ſins? It's very ſad that ſuch things ſhould take place with men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes uſeful, but is in other things, ſo in this hurtful, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hich we ſhould not ſpeak of, were it not that they are ſpread abroad in Books wherewith many may be leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>A 3d. Branch of this errour which this Doctrine refutes, is, that Chriſt died con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally for all hearers of the Goſpel, to whom he is conditionally offered; and this is alſo vented by the ſame Authors who ſay, that though he hath not bought all men abſolutely, nor died to procure life abſolutely to them, yet that he did ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally and upon ſuppoſition that they ſhould afterward believe on him: But there can be no conditional ſatisfaction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:152256:143"/> here, for 1. If reſpect be had only to the ſins of the Elect in Chriſts undertaking, then none is had to the ſins of all. 2. If the Fathers accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the price be abſolute, then there is no conditional buying. 3. If it be conditional then he ſuſpended the effect of his death, the ſatisfaction for his Soul-travel on mans will; And if this condition could not be fulfilled by man, then it is an unwiſe bargain, and nothing of it may fall to be fulfilled, and then believing is no fruit of grace. Again, he hath either bought Faith to them as he hath done to the Elect, or not; If he hath, then they reject it, and ſo grace is not efficacious; If not, he hath bought the end without the midſes leading to it. Or thus, if it be conditional, it's either on a condition which they can fulfil, or on a condition that they cannot fulfil; If it be on a condition which they can fulfil, then it hangs Grace on mens free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, and ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pends the Decree of Election on their receiving of Chriſt; If it be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that is not in their power to fulfil, then either Chriſt hath bought that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, or not; to ſay that he hath not bought the condition of Faith, it will infer a ſtrange aſſertion that he hath bought life and not the condition, the end and not the midſes: And if it be ſaid that he hath bought it, it cannot be ſaid that he hath done ſo abſolutely, becauſe they never get it; Or if abſolutely, then to the Elect only in whom it muſt be, and is in due time ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; And ſo in effect it reſolves in this, that Chriſt's purpoſe is to be bounded and confined (to ſay ſo) to the Elect only.</p>
            <p>There are ſome difficulties and objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that will readily here be moved, which we will not enter upon, only for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miſtakes: It ſtands in the way of ſome to hinder their believing as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that Chriſt hath died for ſome and not for all, aad they know not if they be of that ſmall number; If we were to ſpeak to ſuch, we would ſay, 1. God hath not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected all, and ſo who knows if he hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected them <hi>I</hi> And he will not ſave all, and who knows if he will ſave them? And ſo the doubt will ſtick ſtill; If folks will thus break in upon Gods ſecret will and purpoſe which belongs not to them. 2. Chriſts death for you is not the formal ground not warrand of your Faith, not yet of the offer of the Goſpel, but the Lords will warrand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to believe, and calling for it from you, and his commanding you to reſt upon Chriſt for the attaining of righteouſneſs as he is offered in the Goſpel: We are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his command and promiſe, and we are not firſt called to believe that Chriſt died for us, but we are called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him that is offered to us in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that is our duty, And folks are not condemned becauſe Chriſt died not for them, but becauſe when he offered the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his death and ſufferings to them, they ſlighted and rejected it; We are to look firſt to what Chriſt calleth to, and not to meddle with the other, to wit, whom Chriſt minded in his death, till we have done the firſt: The Word bids all believe that they may be ſaved, and ſuch as neglect this command will be found diſobedient. 3. Though Chriſt hath not died for all, yet all that flee unto him by Faith ſhall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his death, and from this ye ſhould reaſon, and not from his intention in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; If ye come not to him, ye cannot have ground to think that he died for you, but if ye go to him by Faith, ye may expect that he will pray for you, and own you for Believers; Chriſt caſts in that word, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>They have believed thy word,</hi> as well as that other. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me;</hi> And if we put theſe two together, the one will be found as ſure a ground of conſolation as the other; But it were but a poor comfort to ſay that Chriſt died for all, and yet that they may all, or moſt, or many of them periſh for all that.</p>
            <p>The 2d. <hi>Uſe</hi> ſerves to ſtir them up to thankfulneſs for whom Chriſt hath ſatisfied, and who are fled for refuge to him; If there be any here, to whom Chriſt hath manifeſted ſuch love, that they can ſay he hath loved me, and given himſelf for me; O! How are ye obliged to wonder and bleſs him? Greater love than this cannot be;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:152256:144"/> and it ſhould warm your hearts with love to him the more, when ye reflect on God's deſign upon you in particular in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3d. If Chriſt intended his Death and Sufferings only for behove of the Elect; Then, as becauſe few come to Heaven, all ſhould be the more diligent; ſo becauſe Chriſt died not for all, every one ſhould aim in Gods own way to have it made ſure to himſelf that Chriſt died for him, and ſhould be the more watchful and diligent to make his Calling and Election ſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as its not all that are elected, ſo its not all that are purchaſed by Chriſts death; Redemption is ſure in it ſelf, and free Grace kithes conſpicuouſly in it, yet Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Soveraignity do alſo appear in this, that its not of all; therefore ſtudy ye to make it ſure by fleeing to Chriſt by Faith, and by the ſtudy of Holine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>EVery paſſage of our Lords way in proſecuting the work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption hath ſomewhat wonderful in it; we heard of ſeveral of them, eſpecially in his Humiliation, how very low the bleſſed Cautioner conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to come for relief of the captivity; how he was put to wreſtle and fight, and what great Strengths or ſtrong Holds he was put as it were to take in; there is one ſtrong Hold (to ſpeak ſo) not ſpoken of as yet which muſt alſo be ſtormed, and the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of it pulled down by the Mediator, and that is the <hi>Grave;</hi> the Prophet tells us, that as he declined not death, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he decline the Grave, but as he was <hi>cut off out of the land of the living</hi> as a wicked man in the account of men, ſo in the account of men he was taken down from the croſs with the Thieves and buried in the Grave as one of them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble you with diverſity of interpretations, but ſhall only hint at two things for your better underſtanding of the words, in which the difficulty lyeth, The 1. is this, Whether doth this relate to his Humiliation only, or to his Exaltation, or to both? for it cannot be reaſonably thought but his being buried with the wicked is a piece of his Humiliation; to make it only an evidence of his Humiliation, ſeems not to ſtand with the next part of the words, <hi>becauſe he had done no violence,</hi> &amp;c. which is a cauſal reaſon of that which goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But we anſwer, that there may be here a reſpect had unto both; the firſt words reſpect his Humiliation, comparing them with the truth of the Hiſtory as it is ſet down <hi>Matth. chap.</hi> 27. where it is clear that he was deſtinate in the account of men, and by their appointment, to be buried with wicked men: for they thought no more of him than if he had been a wicked man. The next words, <hi>And with the rich in his death,</hi> look to his Exaltation, and the meaning of them is, that however he was in the account of men buried with Thieves, and laid in the grave as a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor or wicked Man; yet in God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and by his appointment and over-rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing providence it was otherwayes, for he put a difference betwixt him and others, and gave him a honourable burial with the rich, though he was deſigned by men to be buried with thieves; yet as we have it <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.57. <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea went to Pilat and begged his body and wrapped it in clean Linnen, and laid it in a new tomb;</hi> which in God's providence was ſo ordered, both to ſhew a difference betwixt him and thoſe thieves, and alſo to declare that he was innocent, as the reaſon ſubjoined
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:152256:145"/> tells, <hi>Becauſe he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth;</hi> and to make way for the clearing of his Reſurrection, he being buried in ſuch a remarkable place where never man had been buried before.</p>
            <p>So then the ſum of the words is this, he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>led in coming to the grave, and in mens account and deſtination was buried as a wicked man, yet by God's Decree and Providence it was ſo ordered, that though he was poor all his days, he had a honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Burial ſuch as rich men uſe to have, <hi>becauſe he had done no violence, neither was the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What is rendered <hi>death</hi> here in our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, is <hi>deaths</hi> in the plural number in the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> to ſhew the greatneſs and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribleneſs of the death which he underwent, and the ſore ſpiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Where it's ſaid in our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, that <hi>He made his grave;</hi> In the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal it is, <hi>He gave his grave with the wicked;</hi> ſo that the Pronoun <hi>He,</hi> may be meaned, rather of the <hi>Father</hi> his giving, or it may be underſtood of the Mediator himſelf his giving; and ſo the meaning is, that it came not to paſs by gueſs on God's ſide, but was by him well ordered; and upon the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſide it ſets out his willingneſs to go to the Grave, and his having an over-ruling hand, as God, in his own death and burial; as he ſaith <hi>John</hi> 10.18. <hi>No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf;</hi> His death and burial were determined and well-ordered as to all the circumſtances of both, by a divine decree and by an over rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It's for the conſolation of the Believer, and ſerves mightily to ſtrengthen him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fear of death and the grave; So that the Believer needs not be afraid of death, but may ly down quietly in the grave, becauſe it was Chriſts bed, warmed, to ſay ſo, by him, he was there before him, and the grave is now to the Believer no part of the curſe, more than death is; The grave will not ſwallow him up with a ſort of dominion and right, as it doth the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. 4. It ſerves to confirm the truth of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, more than if he had never been in the grave, as the Apoſtle proves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. from the beginning to the cloſe, even till he come to that, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting, O grave, where is thy victory?</hi> Our Lord by dying and being buried, hath delivered his people from both; As neither a great Stone, nor a Seal put on it could keep him in the grave, but that he roſe again the third day, ſo no thing will be able for ever to keep Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers at under; and as he died to diſarm death, ſo his entering in the grave was to diſarm the grave, and to open a door for Believers to come thorow it, by his power who was dead and laid in the grave, but now is riſen and alive for evermore.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> are 1. To ſhew the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and agreeableneſs that is betwixt what was foretold of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and what is fulfilled; and ſo ſerves to confirm our Faith in this, that he is the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who was crucified, dead and buried; This is one of the Articles of our Faith foretold by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> now fulfilled and recorded to be ſo in the Goſpel. 2. It ſhews the ſeverity of Juſtice, that when any perſon is made lyable to the laſh of it, were it but as Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, it will exact of him ſatisfaction to the uttermoſt; Therefore when Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters himſelf our Cautionrr, it not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts death, and purſues him till he give up the Ghoſt, but after death purſues him to the grave; It will needs have that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Mediator, and he yields to it ſo as to lay himſelf by as a dead man: O what a revengful thing is Juſtice when a ſinner muſt anſwer to it? When the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator was ſo purſued by it, what will it do to others who are out of him? Here we may apply that word, <hi>Daughters of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves and your children; If it be done ſo to the green tree, what will be done to the dry?</hi> When the fire of the vengeance of God ſhall kindle that lake that burns with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and when ſinners ſhall be caſt into it as ſo many pieces of Wood, or as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pieces of dry ſticks, what will be their

            <p n="3">3 It ſhews the Believers obligation to God that hath ſo fully provided a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for him, and hath furniſhed him with ſuch a ground of conſolation; Beſide what is done for the ſatisfying of Juſtice (which is the great conſolation) there is here ground of conſolation againſt all croſſes, pain, ſickneſs, death and the grave; There is not a ſtep in the way to Heaven but our Lord hath gone it before us; We have not only a Mediator that died, but that was buried; And O! but this is much when Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers come to think on their going to the grave; Will it devour them, or feed upon them for ever? No, he hath muzled it, to ſay ſo; They reſt in their grave as in a bed, in their bodies being united to him, and their duſt muſt be counted for; Its true, the bodies of the reprobate muſt be raiſed up, yet upon another account, and not by vertue of their union with Chriſt, and of Chriſts victory over death in their ſtead, as Believers are; In a word, they have many advantages that have Chriſt, and they have a miſerable life, a comfortleſs death, and a hard lying in the grave that want him; Therefore, as the ſhort cut, to have a happy life, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable death and burial, and the grave ſanctified to you; ſeek to have your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt made ſure, then all things are yours, and particularly death and the grave, which will be as a Box to keep the particles of your duſt till it reſtore them faithfuly to Chriſt, to whom it muſt give an account.

That he was willing to undergo all this is a far greater matter then to welcome a ſinner coming home to him; And if he did all that he did for this very end, will he ſtand on it when it comes to the application? The 2d. word is, that this is, and will be a ground of conviction to all who think little of our bleſſed Lord Jeſus, and of his love, and who will not part with a baſe luſt for him, and who will not make choiſe of him, but will refuſe, reject, undervalue and deſpiſe him, with all that he hath done and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; it will exceedingly aggravat your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that when he was ſo willing to die for the good of ſinners, ye were not willing to live for his ſatisfaction; Think on it, O! think ſeriouſly on it; Theſe things are the truths of God, and the main truths of the Goſpel, that ly very near the ingaging of hearts to Chriſt; And if ſuch truths do you no good, none other readily will; God give us the Faith of them.</p>

It was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary if we conſider the end of his Offices, he being to offer up an acceptable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God, behoved to be holy and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, otherwiſe neither the Prieſt nor the Sacrifice could have been acceptable. 3. It was neceſſary if we conſider the dignity of his Office; It behoved him to differ from the former Prieſts under the Law; And if he had not been without ſin he ſhould not have ſo differed from them. 4. It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the perſons for whom he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took theſe Offices; Such a High Prieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them, and another could not have done their turn; All theſe we will find to be put together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26, 27. Where the Apoſtle having ſaid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. That <hi>he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt theſe that come unto God through him,</hi> ſubjoyns, <hi>For ſuch an High Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, made higher then the heavens, who needeth not daily as theſe high Prieſts to offer up ſacrifices first for his own ſins, and then for the ſin of the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple;</hi> The moſt holy of all the Prieſts had ſins for which they behoved to offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and ſo had the holieſt of the pople, but Chriſt was holy and blameleſs and had no ſin, and it behoved him to be ſo; As I ſaid juſt now, his ſacrifice could never have been accepted for others if he had needed to offer up ſacrifices for himſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> are theſe; Not to ſpeak how it vindicats our Lord Jeſus Chriſt from all theſe aſperſions caſt upon him by wicked men, who called him a <hi>Glutton,</hi> a <hi>Wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners, a Deceiver,</hi> &amp;c. He was holy and harmleſs, and ere long he will gloriouſly appear to be holy, when theſe who pierced him ſhall ſee him and be confounded; I ſay, the <hi>Uſes</hi> are theſe, in reference to the Church and People of God; It ſerves 1 To ſhew the condeſcendency of love, and the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of infinite wiſdome for the behove of ſinners, Such a high Prieſt became us; Love condeſcended and wiſdome contrived that he ſhould become man and ſuffer, <hi>the juſt for the unjust;</hi> Wiſdom ſet on work by grace provided for ſinners ſuch a High Prieſt as they ſtood in need of; And indeed ſinners have no want here, for they have a High Prieſt becoming them, and this is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, that <hi>he is holy, harmleſs, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> &amp;c. 2. It ſerves to be a great ground of encouragement to ſinners, to ſtep to, and make uſe of Chriſts Sacrifice, our Lord had no ſin, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to offer a Sacrifice for himſelf; And if he offered Sacrifice for atonement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did he ſo? It was either for himſelf, and that could not be, for he was holy; or for nothing or for no end, and to ſay ſo were blaſphemy, or it muſt be for a real ſatisfaction for Elect ſinners, or ſuch as ſhould make uſe of him; And thus Faith hath a ſure ground to lay hold on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that his ſatisfaction was real; And that it was for this end, to be made forth-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the behove of ſuch as ſhould believe on him, And therefore look upon Chriſt's ſuffering, and upon his innocency who ſuffered, and ye will find that ye have a ſuitable High Prieſt and atonement made for you; O but that is a ſweet word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. He hath made him to be ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3ly. It's ground of great conſolation to them that betake themſelves to Chriſt, why? our Lords Sacrifice cannot but be accepted, for there was in him no guile, nothing that might make his Sacrifice unſavoury; and as it commends the way of Grace to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo it is ground of encouragement to a ſinner to look to be accepted through him; for if the temptation ſhould ſay, thou art a ſinner, and ſuch and ſuch a great ſinner; that is nothing to purpoſe, for God hath accepted of Chriſt and of his Sacrifice, and if thou make uſe of his Sacrifice, it cannot but be accepted for thee; here then is the conſolation, that we have ſuch an High-Prieſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as became us, who needed not to offer for himſelf, but only for the ſins of the People and of his own People.</p>

Their exponing of the law, ſo as it may ſuit to their own apprehenſion and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet ſo as they ſay, that every Believer or godly Perſon wins not to this perfection to keep the law wholly, but only ſome of their Grandees: This the Lord hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully baniſhed out of the Reformed Churches, as Inconſiſtent with the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Saints, who <hi>find a law in their members warring againſt the law of their mind, and leading them captive to the law of ſin that is in their members;</hi> inconſiſtent with the Scriptures which clear, that none have attained nor do att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:152256:151"/> Though we have reaſon to bleſs God, that the people in this place are kept free of theſe things; yet this truth is worthy the vindicating, and the hazard and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is to be guarded againſt by all of us, when this foul Spirit is driving ſo hard, and prevailing with ſome to publiſh abroad this errour in Papers; And ſo ſeeking to draw people into the ſnare, Lay down but theſe two Principles both now maintained, that they that have Faith have no ſin, and that they that want Grace ſhould not pray, what would they turn to and reſolve in? Satan's deſign in this is doubtleſs to make all untender, and it is both ſad and ſtrange that it is not <hi>ſeen and obſerved;</hi> What a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and torrure would it be to an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and tender Chriſtian, and how would it put his Conſcience on the wrack, to ſay to him, What a Faith is this of yours that cannot keep you altogether from ſin, and that cannot quite overcome the world? God be bleſſed that hath given poor Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers other and better grounds in the Goſpel by which to judge of their Faith, ſo that they may own their Faith as found, though they have a mixture of unbelief with it, and yet unbelief is alwayes a ſin, and may ſay with that poor man, <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4ly. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That to the making up of a perfect holy walk there is a neceſſity both of holineſs in practice, and of foundneſs in judgement, that <hi>no deceit</hi> or guilt <hi>be in the mouth,</hi> and that <hi>no violence be in the bands;</hi> And this is needful to be taken notice of, becauſe many have an aptitude to think, that folks may be truly holy, be of what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, judgement and perſwaſion they will; As if God had left the mind of man to be a bare empty Table or Board that he might Write on it what-ever he liked or pleaſed; But our Lord is vindicated here from the ſcandal of corrupt Doctrine, as well as from ſcandals in his practice; And therefore as we would ſay on the one hand to you who are ſound in your judgement, and hate errour, that if ye be groſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender in your practice, the ſoundneſs of your judgement will not prove you to be holy; So upon the other ſide, we would ſay, that though it were poſſible ye could be ſinleſs in your practice, if ye take a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and liberty as to your judgement to be corrupt, and to vent what ye pleaſe, ye will never get Gods approbation as being holy perſons, therefore let both be joyned together, ſoundneſs in Judgement, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs in Practice; God give the right uſe of theſe things.</p>

            <p>WE were ſpeaking ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the laſt day of our Lord Jeſus His Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, which is here compended and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up in theſe two. 1. That <hi>there was no violence in his hands.</hi> 2. That <hi>there was no deceit in his mouth;</hi> however he was accounted of among Men, and by them numbred among tranſgreſſours, yet he was ſo in very deed, and before God.</p>
            <p>The Prophet proceeds, and anſwers an objection, How came He then to Suffer, if He was ſo innocent? eſpecially His Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings being ordered by God, Who is ſaid to <hi>give His Grave with the wicked?</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the Objection, and removes the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by giving three Grounds for this <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Yet it p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eaſed the Lord to bruiſe Him, He hath put Him to grief;</hi> This is the firſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and it is taken from the Fountain whence His Sufferings proceeded, Gods good Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſure graciouſly ordered it ſo; It was the good pleaſure of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that ſo it ſhould be. The ſecond Reaſon, is taken from the Nature or End of His Sufferings, in theſe Words <hi>when thou ſhalt make His Soul an offering for ſin;</hi> Though he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before Men as a ſinner, yet before God it was an Offering for ſin: To ſatisfie for, and to remove the ſins of His Elect People; The word may be either, <hi>When thou,</hi> or, <hi>when he, ſhall make His Soul an offering for ſin:</hi> But both come to one thing, which is this, That His ſufferings were not ſuch as befell other Men, nay, nor ſuch as befell innocent Men, but they were ordered on an higher deſign, and for an hig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er End, even to be a Satisfaction for Sinners, and to make way for their Freedom. A 3. Reaſon is this, as His Sufferings flowed from God's good Pleaſure, and were a ſatisfaction for the ſins of His Elect People; ſo it hath notable and noble effects. And there are <hi>Three</hi> mentioned here, 1. <hi>He ſhall ſee His ſeed,</hi> He ſhall have a numerous Off-ſpring, many that ſhall hold Eternal L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe of Him; Men by their ſuffering of death are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate to increaſe their off-ſpring, but this is a quickning Suffering, and Death that hath a numerous off-ſpring. 2. <hi>He ſhall prolong His dayes,</hi> Which ſeems to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paradox; For Mens dayes are ſhortned by their Sufferings, and Death; But though He be dead and buried, yet he ſhal Riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and Aſcend, and ſit down on the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of the Father, and live for ever, to make Interceſſion for his People. A 3.
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:152256:152"/> Effect, which is the upſhot of all, <hi>The pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in His hand;</hi> God hath deſigned Him for a Work, which is the great Work of Redemption, even the bringing of many Sons to glory; This is the Will of Him that ſent Him, that He ſhould give Eternal Life to as many as ſhould believe on Him: And this is called God's <hi>good pleaſure</hi> which ſhall thrive and proſper in His hand; He ſhall pull many Captives from the Devil, and ſet many Priſoners free; He ſhal by His Sufferings overcome the Devil, Death and the Grave, and all Enemies; and ſhall gather the Sons of God together, from the four Corners of the Earth; and that Work ſhall not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, nor be fruſtrated, but thrive in His hand: So then in this Text, we have much of the Goſpel compended in few Words.</p>
            <p>We ſhal ſpeak a little to one <hi>Obſervation,</hi> more from the cloſe of the 9. <hi>v.</hi> Where Chriſt Jeſus His Sinleſneſs, and Innocency is holden out, in theſe two, <hi>There was no violence in his hands;</hi> no ſinfull practice in Him; <hi>And there was no deceit in his mouth,</hi> Which looks not only to His ſinleſs carriage before Men, and ſo ſayes, that He was no Liar nor Diſſembler in His Dealing, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them, but alſo to H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Doctrine; And ſo ſayes, that there was no Doctrinal deceit in Him; Which is, when Men lie of God to Men, which is a groſs ſort of lying, and a deceiving of Souls, in making them to take that for Truth which is no Truth: And in derogating from the Truth, and making them take that for Error which is Truth? As the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch, that <hi>they ſpeak lies in hypocriſie:</hi> Theſe words, <hi>There was no deceit in his mouth,</hi> Look to both, eſpecially to the laſt, that is, the Doctrinal deceit of corrupt Teaching (whereof he was free altogether) I ſay it looks eſpecially to that, becauſe he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated, traduced, and called <hi>a deceiver of people,</hi> That is (as if the Prophet had ſaid) moſt untrue of Him, There is no deceitful word in all His Doctrine; though it was imputed to Him, yet he was moſt free of it; Thence <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That exact Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Blamleſſneſſe, takes in Holineſs in a Mans Converſation in reſpect of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and ſoundneſs in His judgement in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Doctrine; for if our Lord be a Pattern of Holineſs, that which was in Him as our Pattern, is called for from us, even to be pure as He is pure; <hi>No violence was in his hands,</hi> He was no Stealer, nor Robber, nor Oppreſſor, (to ſpeak ſo with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) <hi>And there was no deceit in his mouth;</hi> The Word and Worſhip of God was not wronged by Him, and He is holden forth for an Example to us in both.</p>
            <p>That which we would ſay further on this, ſhall be in a word of <hi>Uſe;</hi> Where we may clear both the Branches of the Doctrine, to meet with two exceeding prejudicial Tenets among Men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are ſome who if they be not Erronious in their Opinions, and Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they think they are well enough, and inſult over the Infirmities of Poor Folk, that fall into theſe Errors; And they will, (like theſe ſpoken of) Whore, Drink, Steal, Lie, <hi>&amp;c. And yet lean upon the Lord, and ſay, is not the Lord among us, no evil ſhall come unto us;</hi> Such half and divide Godlineſs; They will not be <hi>Papiſts, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> nor <hi>Sectaries,</hi> but there is much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſſe in their Practice, much Self-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Pride, Hypocriſie, Formality, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, Couſening, Falſhood: And they cover all with this, That they are ſound as to their Profeſſion; though only hearing, and not doing, profeſſing and not practiſing; But they would conſider, that Chriſt ſayeth not, Bleſſed are they that hear only, but <hi>bleſsed are they that do the will of God;</hi> O! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of this great deceit; it is a piece of Chriſts Innocency and Holineſs, That <hi>no violence was in his hands,</hi> There was no ſinfull thing in His practice, no ſinful word came from His mouth; Ye ſhall never be accounted followers of Chriſt, though ye give your bodies to be burnt for the Truth, (as it is to be feared few of you would do,) if your Converſation be not ſuitable, God ſhall never accept of your Teſtimony, therefore divide not theſe things which God hath put together; Let Holineſſe be in your practice, otherwayes <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> yea, the groſſeſt and moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Heretickes, and ye will be utterly diſclaimed.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:152256:152"/>2. The other Branch of the <hi>Uſe</hi> is, That ſuppoſe there were never ſo much appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended tenderneſſe in folks walk, though they were much in Duty, and though they would quite all they had to the Poor, yet if Deceit be in their mouth, if they corrupt the Truth, and teach others ſo to do, there is a want of the half of Holineſſe, yea, in ſome reſpect, of the beſt and chief half of it; And the Reaſon is, 1. Becauſe the Image of God conſiſts as much in the Truth as in the Practice, nay if Practice be not conform to Truth, it is no true Holineſſe, and where Error is drunken in, there is in ſo far an utter unſuitableneſs to the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, as well as where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanity appears in the converſation, <hi>For there was no deceit in his mouth.</hi> 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Word of God preſcrives the Doctrine of Faith to be believed, as well as Duties to be performed, and the right grounding of Faith is a main, if not the main thing wherein the Image of God conſiſts, to wit in <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and Error is as inconſiſtent with Knowledge, as Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is, yea, more; in ſo far as it leaves a contrary impreſſion of untruth on the Soul, which is worſe then ſimple Ignorance. 3. Becauſe, when a Perſon miſcarrieth, by turning aſide from the Truth to Error, he alſo miſcarrieth in his Practice, at leaſt in ſo far; The right conceiving of Truth, being both the ground of our Faith, and the Rule of our Practice: As for inſtance, let once the conceit and fancie come in, of Folks being above Ordinances, no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is thenceforth made of ſanctifying the Sabbath, or Lords day, nor of any other Duty of Worſhip, but Men become almoſt, if not altogether Athieſts. Yea, 4. The incoming of Error begets a ſort of preſumptuous confidence, Therefore Chriſt ſayes, <hi>He that breaks one of theſe command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and teacheth men ſo to do, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the kingdom of God;</hi> he not only breaks the Command himſelf, but he ſeeks to engadge others to do ſo likewiſe, ſo that an Error from the Truth, is a ſin againſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irſt Table, and ſo among the greateſt Evils; And the teaching, and propogating of Error, is a ſin againſt the Second Table, becauſe it hazards the Soul of our Neighbour; whereas violence in the hands hurts only his Perſon or Eſtate; And 5ly. If we look to the riſe of <hi>Error,</hi> or whence it comes, we will find it to be a Fruit of the Fleſh. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. And that which flows from our corruption, and is therefore ranked in with <hi>Witchcraft, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Furnication, Idolatry, Hatred, Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> &amp;c. 6. If we look to the Scriptures account of it, and of the Propogators of it, We will find that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. They are called <hi>falſe apoſtles, deceitfull workers, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of ſatan,</hi> not common ſins, <hi>transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves into the miniſters of Chriſt, and no marvel, for ſatan himſelf is transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an angel of light:</hi> For their work is to gather in Souls to the Devil, to hale them, as in a Net to him, to be Diſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ples to him. Or, 7. If we look to the Effects that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon Error, and upon the propogation of it, we will find them to be dreadful; for as it is, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>They draw upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 3.16. <hi>They wreſt,</hi> or pervert <hi>the Scriptures to their own deſtruction.</hi> In all theſe reſpects, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in Judgement is as evil, (if not worſe) then prophaneneſſe in practice. And if we look thorow the Churches of Chriſt, we will find that there hath been more pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable havock, and deſtruction of Souls ſince <hi>Antichrist</hi> aroſe, by his groſſe Errors, and damnable Deluſions, then hath readily been by ſin in Practice; which Men do not own and avouch, as they do theſe Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Think therefore ſeriouſly on this; whoever would be pure as Chriſt is pure, would ſtudy ſoundneſſe in Judgement, as well as tenderneſſe in Practice; And yet how many are readily miſtaken in this? Who, if they meet with ſome that can ſpeak a few good Words, and make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to a holy Walk, though the Second Command be baff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed and diſgraced by them, and the Name of God torn? And though the Fourth Command be made of none effect, or price by them, it's thought but little of, all is covered with this, that they are good Folks, and of a tender walk; But, Oh! can they be good, who abuſe that wherein the Name and Image of God
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:152256:153"/> are moſt tenderly concerned? and will God account that to be Holineſſe aggree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to His Law, that ſlights, depreclars, and vilifies the beſt part of His Law? Let me therefore beſeech you to take in, and to cloſe Error with other ſins, and to look upon unſoundneſſe in the Truths of God, as a Fruit of the Fleſh; and withall to look upon ſound knowledge in the Mind and the form of ſound words in the Mouth, as being a Duty, that is called for from you, as well as other Duties: We the rather take occaſion to ſpeak to this, becauſe the Devil is ſeeking to turn Men meer Athieſts, <hi>Gallio's</hi> as to the Truths of God, to <hi>care for none of theſe things;</hi> and as to weir out the eſteem of Truth, ſo to make People to look upon Error, as if there were no hurt by it; it's ſad that there is not more ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at, and keeping diſtance from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſuch; if they can but give a parcel of good Words, and make ſhewes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Piety: in this lukewarm time, there is need to guard againſt this Temper, or rather Diſtemper; and to look well that we half not, nor divide the Pattern and Copie which God in his Word hath caſt to us, and ſet before us; we would ſtudie Purity and Tenderne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>We come now to the 10. <hi>verſe;</hi> and from the firſt part of it, <hi>yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief.</hi> Theſe three things ariſe clearly. 1. That though our Lord Jeſus was moſt innocent in His own Perſon; yet was He put to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſore Tryalls, and ſharp Sufferings, For 1: <hi>He was bruiſed,</hi> to wit, like Corn betwixt the upper and neither Milſtones, or l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke Grapes in the Wine preſſe, which reſpects not ſo much his outward ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, though great <hi>(for a bone of him was not broken,)</hi> as His inward Soul-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the inward preſſures of Wrath that were on His Humane Soul. 2. <hi>He was put to grief;</hi> was ſore ſtraitned and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and theſe expreſſions import ſo much, <hi>my ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death, my ſoul is ſore troubled and what ſhal I ſay; and my God my God why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> The particulars of this grief were ſpoken to before; and we ſhew in what reſpect He was ſo humbled, and that He was moſt ſinleſs, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thout any the leaſt carnal mude or paſſion, under theſe expreſſions, in which the ſenſe of grief vented it ſelf moſt in Him. Only if it be here aſked, what is the reaſon, why the Prophet doth ſo much inſiſt, in pointing out Chriſt's Sufferings, and the extremity of them, that ſcarce almoſt is there one Verſe, but he hath in it ſome one or other new aggravation of them? we conceive the reaſon of it is, 1. Becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein the greatneſs of the Love of God, and the kindlineſſe of the Mediators condeſcending doth appear in this; for the more He Suffered, the more the Love of God ſhined; and His condeſcendency ky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed the more; this being the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and demonſtrative proof of the Love of God, <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave His only begotten Son,</hi> As it is <hi>John</hi> 3.16. O! manifold and vaſtly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive <hi>So,</hi> what is unfolded in it, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity will but ſuffice fully to unfold; and this being the great inſtance of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators condeſcendencie, and of His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending His Love to ſinners; <hi>That while we were yet enemies, he died for us.</hi> As it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. The Lord loves to have this the ſubject of our thoughts, that we may be led thereby in to the Soul-raviſhing, and ſatisfying contemplation of the Love whence it came. 2. Becauſe there is not any one thing that lyes nearer, or that is readily of greater concern to Believers,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:152256:153"/> then to be well acquainted with Chriſt's Sufferings, wherein the Lord would have his People ſpiritually perqueir: and it is of their concernment, in a twofold reſpect. 1. As it is the ground of their peace, Therefore He is called our Peace, and a Propitiation; for by being acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As it is the ground of their Conſolation; conſidering that they have a ſuffering Mediator, that hath payed the Price that was due by them; even ſuch an One that knows <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> what it was to be bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Wrath, and is therefor very tender of, and compaſſionat towards Souls that are under challenges, and apprehenſions of Wrath; Theſe are ſweet words, which we have to this purpoſe. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an advocat with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, who is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to Suffer and Satisfie for them: O! con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider then what ye are doing, when ye read of His sufferings, for the very Marrow of the Goſpel, and the Life of the Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the People of God lyes here. 2. From theſe words. <hi>Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief; Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> That the Lord Jehovah had the main and principal hand, in all the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this Innocent Mediator: It was not the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> nor <hi>Pilat; but it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, and to put him to grief.</hi> As is clear, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.27, 28. <hi>Herod and Pontius Pilat, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and People of Iſrael were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to do whatſoever thy hand and thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell determined before to be done.</hi> In all that they did, they were but doing that which was carved out before, in the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fluence of the Lords hand, in theſe three reſpects, in Chriſts Pufferings, 1. In reſpect of His appointing them; It was concluded in the Counſel of God, what He ſhould Suffer, what ſhould be the Price that Jehovah would have, and the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>crifice that he would accept of from His hand. 2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Ordering and Over-ruling of His Sufferings, when it came to the execution of His Ancient Decree; He who governs all the Counſells, Thoughts, and Actions of Men; did in a ſpecial manner, govern and over-rule the Sufferings of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, though wicked men were following their own deſigne; and were ſtirred and acted by the Devil, who is ſaid to have <hi>put it into the heart of Judas</hi> to betray Chriſt; yet God had the ordering of all, who ſhould betray Him, what death He ſhould die, how He ſhould de pierced, and yet not a bone of Him broken. 3. In reſpect of His having had a hand actively in them; and as he was the chief Partie that purſued Chriſt; it was He that was exacting the Elects Debt of Him; therefore the Lord looks over <hi>Pilat</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> to Him; and ſayes to <hi>Pilat thou couldeſt have no power over me except it were given thee from above;</hi> and to His Father, <hi>Father take this cup from me; and my God my God wby haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> He was purſued as ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cautioner in our room; in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son;</hi> He ſpared Him not when He cryed, but would have Him drinking out the Cup, and <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Awake O ſword againſt my ſhepherd, and againſt the man that is my fellow, ſmite the ſhepherd.</hi> The Meſſage comes from Him, and He gives the Sword a charge, and orders it to ſmite Him: In all which reſpects, it's ſaid, <hi>The Lord bruiſed him, and he hath put him to grief.</hi> It was this, more then Sword, or Naills, or Speir, or Whipe, that made Him cry out, another, and a higher hand brought his ſinleſs Soul to more bitterneſs, then all the Sufferings He endured from Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> This leads us in to the vendicating of the Soveraign and Holy Providence of God, in that wherein Men have a moſt ſinful
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:152256:154"/> hand, and are moſt unexcuſable; though <hi>Judas</hi> that bettayed, and <hi>Pilat</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Innocent Son of God, acted moſt ſinfully; yet the Lord himſelf hath an active over-ruling Hand, in carring on His own deſign; and what <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Pilat,</hi> with other wicked Men did, was ſo far from being by gueſs, that they were the executions of His Ancient Decrees, and He is moſt Pure and Spotleſs, in venting and manifeſting Grace, Holineſs and Juſtice, when men were venting their Corruptions, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and Injuſtice moſt: Therefore the Holy Providence of God mixeth n more as to any ſinleſs participation with mens ſin, in their ſinfull and wicked actings, than the Covenant of Redemption mixed it ſelf with the ſinfulneſſe of them that crucified Chriſt: Nay this is a principal Diamond in His Crown, that He cannot only govern all the natural ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes that are in the World, in their ſeveral Courſes and Actings, and order them to His own glory, but even Devils, and wicked Men, and Hypocrites, their moſt corrupt and abominable Actions, and make them infruſtrably ſubſervient to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of His own holy ends and purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and yet be free of their ſin; for which they ſhall count to Him; And as it was no excuſe to <hi>Judas,</hi> nor to <hi>Pilat</hi> that they did what before was decreed of God; ſo it ſhall be no excuſe to any Man in a ſinful courſe; that God hath a hand in every thing that comes to paſſe; who yet is juſt and holy in all: It may alſo ſtay our hearts when the Devil, and his Inſtruments, as it were, are runing mad; that they can do no more then what God permits, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay ſome way commiſſionateth them to do. The Devil could not ſo much as touch a tail of one of <hi>Job's</hi> ſheep, without leave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſked and given: <hi>O! the deepth both of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and of the wiſdom of God; how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable are his wayes, and his judgments paſi finding out.</hi> 3. As we may ſee here the concurrence of the Perſons of the bleſſed Trinity, Father, Son and holy Ghoſt; the concurrence of Jehovah with the Mediator, for carrying on the ſame deſign, the work of Mans Redemption, (for it pleaſed them all;) So taking the Lord Jehovah eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as comprehending all the three Perſons, we may <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That the Lord is well wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to, and hath delight in proſecuting the work of Redemption, though even to the bruiſing of the ſecond Perſon of the God-head, conſidered as became Man and Mediator, not that He delighted in the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings as ſuch, of His Innocent Son, for <hi>he affects not willingly the children of men;</hi> but conſidering the end, and the effects that were to follow, to wit, the Seed that He ſhould beget ro Eternal Life, and the Captives whom He was to redeem: In that reſpect, it was not only againſt His will, but it pleaſed Him well, or as the word is in the New Teſtament, <hi>It was his good pleaſure,</hi> alluding, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>is like to this of the Prophet; Hence, when Chriſt ſpeaks of the work of Redemption: He calleth it the <hi>Fathers will</hi> and <hi>work;</hi> the Fathers <hi>will,</hi> when He ſayes, <hi>I came not to do my own will, but the will of him that ſent me,</hi> The Fathers <hi>work,</hi> while He ſayes, <hi>I have finiſhed the work thou gaveſt me to do;</hi> And here it is called His <hi>pleaſure;</hi> for there was nothing without Himſelf to move Him to it; when He might have ſuffered all fallen Mankind to lye ſtill in their forlorne condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; It pleaſed Him to give His Son of His own good will, to redeem ſeveral of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> If we put theſe Doctrines together they affoord us wonderful matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. 1. That we have an able Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that hath given a ſufficient ranſome for us, a price that cannot be overvalued. 2. A willing Mediator, that gave himſelf, no man took His Life from Him, but He laid it down of Himſelf, and took it up again. 3. A willing Jehovah, contriving and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſure in contriving the Redemption of Elect Sinners, through the Death of His own Son: Which reproves, and gives check to the wonderfully ſtrange miſtakes that are often found with ſome poor Souls concerning the way of Peace; as ſome will be ready to ſay, if C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riſt were as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take me, as I am to take Him; as willing to welcome me, as I am to come to Him: But is not this a proof of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:152256:154"/> His willingneſſe, that He was content to be bruiſed, and put to grief about the work of your Redemption? others have a ſecret apprehenſion, that if God were as willing to receive and ſave them, as Chriſt is, they would have more confidence; but ſayes the Prophet here, that it <hi>pleaſed the father to bruiſe him?</hi> in whoſe breaſt (to ſpeak ſo) bred the plot of ſinners Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption? Jehovah thought it good: He loved the ſalvation of ſinners ſo well, that He was content to ſeem in a manner regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of His own Sons cryes and tears, for a time, to make way for performing the ſatisfaction that was due to Juſtice; and He did this with good will, and pleaſantly. We ſhall not inſiſt more on particular <hi>Uſes;</hi> but is there, or can there be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ground of Conſolation, then this? or is there any thing wanting here to compleat the Conſolation? Is there not an well ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Saviour commiſſionate to give Life to whom He will? Who hath purchaſed it, that He may give it, and a well willing, loving, and condeſcending God, willing to give His Son, and willing to accept of His Death for a Ranſome, and what would ye have more? The Partie offended, is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be in friendſhip with the offending Partie, and to give and accept of the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; what can Tentation ſay, or what ground is for Jealouſie to vent it ſelf here? <hi>He that did not ſpare his own Son,</hi> but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and freely <hi>gave him to death for us all, how ſhall be not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> As it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. And if <hi>we were reconcilled to God by the death of his Son, when we were enemies, ſhall we not much more be ſaved by his life,</hi> as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. There is a great diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt, and other Gifts, yea and the gift of Heaven it ſelf; and ſhall a poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner have a ſuffering Saviour given, and may he not alſo expect pardon of Sin, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Faith, Repentance, and Admiſſion to the Kingdom? There is here good and ſtrong ground of Conſolation, to them that will build on it, let the Fathers, and Chriſts love to you be welcome in it's offers; that His end in bringing many Sons to glory, be not fruſtrated by any of you, ſo far as you can, though it cannot indeed be fruſtrated; <hi>For the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand, and he ſhall ſee the travel of his ſoul and be ſatisfied.</hi>

            <p>CHriſt and His Sufferings have been a moſt delightſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be ſpoken and heard of, before ever He ſuffered; and they would be to us now no leſs, but much more ſo; even very glad tydings to hear, that ever the Son of God was made an Offering for ſin.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Verſe,</hi> as we hinted the laſt day, doth ſet forth Chriſt's Sufferings, and in theſe three, that the deſign of God in bruiſing the Innocent Lamb of God might be the better taken up. 1. They are hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en forth in the riſe where they bred, or in the fountain whence they flowed, the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:152256:155"/> good pleaſure of God. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, to put him to grief.</hi> Which the Prophet marks, 1. To ſhew that all the good that comes by Chriſt to ſinners, is bred in the Lords own boſom: It was concluded, and contrived there, and that with delight; There being no conſtraint, or neceſſity on the Lord to give His Son, or to provide Him to be a Cautioner for dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſinners, but is was His own good pleaſure to do ſo. 2. To ſhow the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of all the Perſons of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in promoving the Work of Redemption of ſinners; which was executed by the Son the Mediator, to ſhew, that the Love of the Son in giving His Life, is no greater then the Love of the Father, in contriving and accepting of it for a Ranſom; there being naturally in the hearers of the Goſpel this prejudice; that the Father is more rigid, and leſs loving then the Son, but conſidering, that it was the Father, Son, and Spirit that contrived Chriſts Sufferings; that the Sons Sufferings were the Product, and Conſequent of this contrivance, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth this corrupt imagination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and ſheweth, that there is no place for it; It doth alſo contribute notably to our ingadgement to God, to be throughly perſwaded of the Lords good pleaſure, in the Sufferings of the Mediator, as well as in the Willingneſs of the Mediator to Suffer; He having performed the will of the Father in the loweſt ſteps of His Humiliation. 2. They are expreſt, and holden forth in their Nature and End, they were to be <hi>an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſin;</hi> and this follows well on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>verſe,</hi> becauſe it might be ſaid, How could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He that <hi>had no violence in his hands, nor guile in his mouth,</hi> be brought ſo low? He hath anſwered in part, by ſaying. <hi>It pleaſed the Father to bruiſe him, and to put him to grief:</hi> But becauſe that does not ſo fully obviat, and anſwer the Objection; He anſwers furder, that there was a notably good end for it: Though He had no ſin in Himſelf, nor are we to look on His Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as for any ſin in Him, yet we are to look upon them as a Satisfaction to Juſtice, for the ſins of others; even as the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, Lambs, and Rams, and the Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goat, were not ſlain for their own ſins, for they were not capable of ſin, yet they were ſome way Typical Offerings, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisfactions for ſin, in the room of others for whom they were offered; ſo our Lord Jeſus is the proper Offering, and Sacrifice for the ſins of His Elect People; and His Sufferings are ſo to be looked on by us, and this is the Scop. But to clear the words a little more fully, there are different readings of them, as they are ſet down here in the Text, and on the Margent. Here it is <hi>when his ſoul ſhall make an offering for ſin</hi> (On the Margent it is, <hi>when his ſoul ſhall make an offering for ſin.</hi>) The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diverſity is, becauſe the ſame Word in the Original, which ſignifies the Second Perſon Maſculine, <hi>Thou,</hi> meaning the Father; ſignifies the Third perſons Foeminine: <hi>his ſoul ſhall make it ſelf;</hi> but one the matter, whether we apply it to the Father, or to Chriſt, both come to one thing; It ſeems to do as well to apply it to Chriſt; the former Words having ſet out God's concurrence, and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the Work; theſe ſet out the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators Willingneſſe; as in the laſt <hi>Verſe,</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>He poured out his ſoul unto death;</hi> and properly Chriſt is the Prieſt that offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up Himſelf; yet we ſay, there is no difference on the matter now, as to the ſcope, the will of the Father, and of the Mediator, in this Work of Redemption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both one; though (as we ſaid) we incline to look on them, as relating to Chriſt. 2. <hi>Offering for ſin;</hi> in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſignifies <hi>ſin;</hi> ſo that the Words are, <hi>when thou ſhalt make his ſoul ſin;</hi> The Words being ordinarly uſed in the Old Teſtament, and thence borrowed in the New Teſtament, to ſignifie a <hi>ſin offering,</hi> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.14 and <hi>Levit.</hi> 4.5. and 16. <hi>Chapters,</hi> where the ſin offering is appointed, it is the ſame Word that's here, intimating that, that Sin-offering was deſigned to bear their ſin. <hi>They ſhall lay their hands on the Sin,</hi> or Sin-offering; becauſe the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Beaſt was Typically to have the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſins imputed to it, though properly, no mans fin is imputed to any, but to Chriſt. This is alſo clear, if we compare,

               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, 6. That which in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> is rendered Sin-offering, in the Original is <hi>Sin,</hi> but the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. hath it <hi>ſacrifice for ſin;</hi> and it is the ſame Word which he hath, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. He was made ſin for us,</hi> that is an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſin; by which we may ſee the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantableneſs of ſome Mens accounting Chriſt to be formally a Sinner, becauſe He is called Sin; and becauſe our Sin is ſaid to be laid on Him; which in Scripture Phraſe, is as much as His being a Sacrifice for ſin, in the room of Sinners.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>His ſoul</hi> may be taken either ſimply; for, <hi>He ſhall be an offering for ſin,</hi> the Soul being often taken for the whole Perſon; or it may be taken more properly, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to His Sufferings, called <hi>the travel of his ſoul, Verſ.</hi> 11. however it is the Perſon, the Man Chriſt, Soul and Bodie, that is the Sacrifice, and more eſpecially His Soul as the Wrath of God was on it; and when He ſuffered, His Soul did undergo that Wrath, as well as His Back, was given to the Smiter, and His Cheecks to them that plucked off the Hair.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There are two Words furder, which we would hint at, in the Expoſition, for clearing of Chriſt's being called <hi>an offering for ſin.</hi> 1. We would put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Offerings and Sacrifices which were for Sin under the Law; and this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering which is applyed to Chriſt. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſayes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>That it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the blood of bullocks, and of goats could take away ſin;</hi> They were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Sin-offerings, but as they were Types of that Offering which was to come; and ſo when Chriſt is called an Offering, He is differenced from all the Offerings that were offered before Him, by Prieſts on Earth; In this, That His Offering, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Sacrifice takes away Sin, by vertue of it ſelf, according to the Covenant. But theſe Offerings of of thoſe Prieſts that were under the Law, (as is clear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13.) Took not away ſin by themſelves, but only in ſo far as Chriſt who was Typifyed by them was made uſe of; and from this we may ſee it clear. 1. That it was by the Blood of Chriſt, that the Fathers under the Law had their ſin pardoned; and that the Pardon of ſin was to them an effect of this Offering, as well as unto us. 2. That all theſe Sacrifices and Offerings under the Law, were Types of this one Offering, and not that one Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie Sacrifice, only which was offered once a Year, by the High Prieſt; which we the rather hint at, becauſe, both theſe are by <hi>Socinus,</hi> that enemie of Chriſt's Satisfaction controverted; he aiming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to draw Souls from lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning to this Offering. 2. What we ſpeak of Chriſt's Sacrifice, relates to that which He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on Earth, though He be yet a Prieſt, and <hi>lives for ever to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us;</hi> yet this Offering reſpects that which He offered while He was here in the World, and eſpecially that which He offered on the Croſs, as it is ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. <hi>He hath loved us, and given himſelf for us an offering and ſacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12. <hi>This man after he had offered one ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſins for ever ſat down on the right hand of God;</hi> and by His Sacrifice once offered up before, He went into the moſt Holy; <hi>He hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified:</hi> which is alſo a Truth contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by that ſame enemy <hi>Soncinus;</hi> the clearing of it ſerves not only to open up the meaning of this place, but to let us ſee the effecacy of Chriſts Sufferings, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them, that in them eſpecially, His Offering, as it brings Pardon of ſin, and Peace with God does conſiſt; ſo then the meaning of the place is in ſhort, That though our Lord Jeſus had no ſin, yet it pleaſed God in His Counſell, to appoint Him to Suffer, and that His Sufferingt ſhould be an Offering for the ſin of others.</p>
            <p>More particularly, If it be aſked, what is meaned by this, <hi>an offering for ſin,</hi> we ſhall clear it from the Type; and 1. It is here ſupponed, that there is ſin on the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that wrath due for ſin is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. 2. It is ſuppoſed, that there is an inability in the Perſon to remove the ſin, and yet a neceſſity to have it removed, or elſe he muſt ſuffer. 3. There is ſuppoſed the interveening, or coming of ſomething in the place of that Perſon that is guilty of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:152256:156"/> ſin, and lyable to wrath. 4. There is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the acceptation of that which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veeneth by God, the Partie offended; and ſo it preſuppoſeth a Covenant, whereby the Lord hath condeſcended to accept of that offering. Take it in the Sin-offering goat, the Scape-goat <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. A vive Type of Chriſt, when He is brought into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. 1. The Prieſt muſt put his hands upon him; and confeſs the ſins and tranſgreſſions of the People over him, which ſignified their acknowledgement of their ſins, and a lyableneſs to ſuffering, becauſe of them. 2. It ſuppoſed their propoſing of that Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, as a Sacrifice to bear their ſins, and to take them on him; Therefore it was ſaid, <hi>The Prieſt ſhall put</hi> the iniquities of the People upon him. 3. The one of theſe Goats was to be ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into the Wilderneſs, and the other was to be killed; and generally all the Sin-offerings were to be killed: So that no Remiſſion of ſins was without Blood, and they came in the room of the Sinners, bearing, as it were their ſin, and their puniſhment. And 4. It is to be <hi>an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement,</hi> to wit, a Typical Atonement; by this means the People were to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to Eccleſiaſtical Priviledges; but they could not purifie the Conſcience, except Chriſt were made uſe of; who was the true atonement then, as He is now, ſtill for ſin; and by vertue of His Sacrifice according to the Covenant, they were to deall for the pardon of the ſins born by Him.</p>
            <p>We come now to <hi>Obſerve</hi> ſomethings from the Words, and 1. It is ſupponed here, that even the Elect, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all others, are by their ſin lyable to God's Judgement, and obnoxious to His wrath; there were no need of a Sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if this were not. The name that Chriſt gets here, ſuppoſes that there was Sin, and that there was wrath for Sin ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the door of all Men; ſince Man fell, and brake God's Command; all Men are before God like <hi>Iſaac,</hi> lying before his Father, ready to be killed, his Father having his hand ſtretched out with the knif, ready to take away his Life: And our Lord Jeſus is as the <hi>Ram</hi> that was caught <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the thicket of Thorns, whereby Elect Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are fred, and Himſelf made the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that was provided in their room and place: Thus in the Name that our Lord Jeſus gets, we have holden out to us, the poſture that all of us are in by nature, if Chriſt interveen not to take the ſtroak off us, on Himſelf; laying Himſelf open to the ſtroak of Juſtice for Sin: To clear it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe three things, which will hold out, what this ſtate and poſture of ours is. 1. The natural ſinfulneſs, and guilt that Men are lying under, which makes them naked, and to be as that wretched Infant, (ſpoken of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.) Lying in their Blood, caſt forth into the open field, to the loathing of their perſons. This makes God and them to be at feed, and layes them open to the ſtroak of Juſtice. 2. Conſider the interveening of the Law of God, that threatens the Curſe on ſin wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, and pronunces this Sentence, that <hi>the wages of ſin is death,</hi> and ſayes to the Sinner, as it is ſaid to <hi>Cain, If thou ſin, death lyes at the door;</hi> and in this ſenſe, Sinners are not only lyke to Malefactors, taken and apprehended, but like to ſuch when ſentenced to death; Therefore <hi>John</hi> 3.18. It's ſaid, <hi>He that believes not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already.</hi> 3. Conſider that Men in their natural ſtate, who have broken the Covenant of Works, have Juſtice ſome way purſuing them, to the executing of the Sentence, which God in His Law hath pronunced againſt them; and they are as theſe ſhedders of Blood, before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves in to the City of Refuge, having the avenger of Blood following hard at their heell's; in which ſenſe, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. It's ſaid, <hi>He that believes not, the wrath of God abids on him;</hi> There is an actual appointment, or ordination of the Curſe added to the Laws Sentence, till by Chriſt it be removed, and this is in ſome ſort grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Him, and taking Him as it were by the throat; By the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe Man is found guilty, and lyable to Judgement; by the <hi>Second,</hi> he is Sentenced; but by the <hi>Third,</hi> the Sentence ſtands over his head, ready to be executed, and beſpeaks him thus, therefore thou art curſed, therefore thou art a dead Man.</p>
            <pb n="307" facs="tcp:152256:156"/>
            <p>Soberly think upon this, and make theſe <hi>Uſes</hi> of it, 1. See here the condition of all Men by nature, and your own in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, a very terrible and dreadfull conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wherein they are like Men lying bound to be a Sacrifice to the wrath of God, the Lords hand being ſtreatched out, to lay on the ſtroak, and the wrath of God abiding on them, do ye indeed belleve this to be your ſtate and poſture; till applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be made of Chriſts Sacrifice, and till there be a laying of your Sin over on Him by Faith, that ever till then ye are lyable to the Laws Sentence, and that the Cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and Wrath of God abydeth on you? and yet this is the ſtate and poſture of all the Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> that have not got Jeſus Chriſt put in their room: It was Typicall, if the People did not bring an offering, as was preſcribed, their Sin remained in them; but it's reall here, Sin and Wrath remain, where Chriſt is not made uſe of by Faith.</p>
            <p>The 2. <hi>Uſe</hi> is, for Expoſtulation with many of you, that are ſtill in Nature, (and I wiſh there were fewer of you in this caſe to be ſpoken to) How comes it to paſſe, when this is your condition by Nature, that ye are ſo ſecure, and that ye have few, or no apprehenſions at all of the Wrath of God; and of the hazard of your immortal Souls? Ah! are there none ſuch here, that apprehend there hazard? were ye ever under it? and if ſo, how have ye been delivered out of it? or who is come in your room? do ye think it nothing to be under Sin, and the Curſe of God, to have Wrath abiding in you, yea abiding on you? There are many of you who are ſleeping ſound now, and that diſdain to notice Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, but as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of the Man that was ſleeping on the top of a Maſt, and compleaning of that, and of them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him; So ſhall it be with you, that can lye ſtill ſecurely ſleeping in ſin, and that put by one day after another, and do not make uſe of this Sacrifice: All that the Goſpel aims at is this, that ye would ſeek to change rooms with Chriſt, that the feed may be rem ved, and that the quarrel that is betwixt God and you may not be continued and keeped up; eſpecially, ſeing there is a way laid down how to get your Debt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for; which if ye neglect, what wil ye do, when your day is gone? are there not many dying dayly, and is there not a day of reckoning coming, when the ſtroak that is hanging, and hovering over your head will light? and ſeeing it is ſo, why do ye lye ſtill, and ſlight Jeſus Chriſt? If it were believed what dreadful wrath is abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many (whereof your ſecure ſenſleſneſs, and ſenſleſs ſecurity is a part) and what a terror it will waken in your Conſciences one day, ye would certainly think it good news to have the Sufferings of Chriſt ſpoken of, and the Benefit of them offered to you now.</p>
            <p>The 3. <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to ſtir up Sinners to thankfulneſſe, eſpecially, ſuch of you as are bleſt with effectual counſel, to make the right uſe of this Sacrifice; O! Conſider how much ye are oblidged to God, and to Chriſt the Mediator; the preaching of the Goſpel is now thought little of, and is taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to many; but did ye know what is your ſtate and poſture by Nature, how near ye are to hell, and how near the Curſe and Wrath are unto you, even ready to graſp at you, to tear and devour you, the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators interpoſing to Satisfie for you, would make him more lovely to you; and ye that have gotten intereſt in Him ſecured, would think your ſelves much, unſpeakably much in His common to ſay ſo, and in the Debt of His Grace: this was the poſture that Grace found you in, even lyable to the ſtroak of Gods drawn Sword of Juſtice; and our Lord Jeſus on the one ſide ſtepped in, and ſaid hold, Lord; let that be on me, and let them go free, and upon the other ſide, there was Gods good pleaſure, condeſcending to except of His offer; and ſaying, <hi>Awake O ſword, and ſmite the ſhepherd, and ſpare the ſheep,</hi> what obligation ſhould this lay upon you, to love and be thankfull to God, and to the Mediator, who interpoſed to keep the ſtroak off you; I ſay upon you who are ſinners, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of Wrath? This is Chriſts offer, and if ye be fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d to Him for refuge, he hath changed Rooms with you; ye are
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:152256:157"/> much (as I ſaid) in His Debt, He hath fred you of your Debt, and purchaſed an abſolution to you, and <hi>there is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to you,</hi> as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before ye were in a manner condemned already; But the truth is, our Lord Jeſus is undervalued, not only by them that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not their hazard, and ſo make not uſe of Him, but alſo in a great meaſure by them that do apprehend it; in ſo far as they give way to Unbelief, and dar ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truſt to His Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>The 2. and next thing implyed here, is, That though men be Naturally under Sin, and obnoxious to the Wrath and Curſe of God, by reaſon of Sin, yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can take away that Sin, and free them from Wrath but Chriſt Jeſus His Offering up of Himſelf a Sacrifice for Sin; Therefore He is ſo made the Offering for Sin here, as it is <hi>excluſive</hi> of all other things; no other thing could do it; As it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. <hi>He by one offering hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for ever theſe who are Sanctified.</hi> The Blood of Bulls and of Goats could not take away Sin, <hi>neither is,</hi> as it is, (<hi>Act.</hi> 4.12.) <hi>There any other name under heaven given to ſinners whereby they can be ſaved, but the name of Jeſus:</hi> I ſhall not ſpeak here of the Nature of Chriſt's Offering and Sacrifice; but ſure, though all Men be under Sin, and Wrath by Nature, there is no other way to remove it, except by this Sacrifice; Thouſands of Rams, (as it is <hi>Micah</hi> 6.7.) and ten thouſand Rivers of Oyle, the firſt Born of the Body, will not take away the ſin of the Soul; Chriſt's Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Himſelf, in Gods account, is only the Sin-offering, for the removing of Sin; and Wrath from Sinners: Is it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to prove this? we wiſh it were not, but the truth is, it's hardly believed by Men, and Women; Conſider therefore ſhortly theſe three things, and ye will find it true, 1. The Certification and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorineſs of the Curſe that follows Sin, as we may ſee, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law to do them;</hi> whatever may be ſaid of Gods abſolute Soveraignity, whereof we will not now ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God hath ſo Ordered His Covenant, and revealled His Will in His Word, that <hi>the ſoul that ſins ſhall die,</hi> if a Sacrifice be not put in His Room. 2. Conſider the ineffectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all other things to ſatisfie Juſtice, though we would multiply Offerings, what cares God for theſe? <hi>All the beasts on the mountains are his, he delights not in the blood of bulls and goats,</hi> as it is <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50. Thouſands of Rams, and ten thouſand Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Oyl are rejected; whether we look to Pennances, (whereof ſome fooliſhly talk,) what can theſe do to God? or whether we look to Mens External Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, of Holy Duties, or to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Convictions; Challenges, and Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for Sin, there is no ſuitable value in theſe things, to interpoſe betwixt them, and God's Wrath; ſuppone that Man after the fall could perform Duties without Sin; therefore the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. ſayes, that <hi>it was impoſſible that the blood of bullocks, and of goats could take away ſin;</hi> There is no Suitableneſs nor Proportionableneſſe, betwixt the Blood of a Beaſt, and the Soul of a Sinner; far leſs betwixt it, and the Majeſty of God that is wronged by Sin; wherefore, when the Sufferings of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are lengthened to twenty thouſand Millions of Years in Hell, the Juſtice of God is never ſatisfied, nor never will be to the full; what then can other things do. 3. There is no other thing, that hath a Promiſe made, or annexed to it, nor is there any other mean laid down, for the removall of Sin and Wrath; but Chriſt Offering Himſelf up a Sin-offering: I know ſome are ready to think, that though there be no worth in the thing, or Duty; yet God of His free Grace will acccept of it; but is there a Promiſe of God's accepting any other thing for a Satisfaction for Sin, or for the removall of Wrath, but Chriſts Sacrifice alone? And will, or can Folks expect that, for which they have no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? The Scripture is plain and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory in this, as namely, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.14 <hi>There is no other name under heaven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a ſinner can be ſaved, but by the name of Jeſus, He is the door,</hi> Joh. 10. <hi>the way, the Truth, and the Life;</hi> John 14. <hi>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:152256:157"/> are yea, and amen in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. There is greater neceſſity to be through in this, though a common Truth, then Folks think of; And for <hi>Uſe,</hi> It aims at theſe two, 1. Upon the one ſide, to cry down all beſide, that pretends to ſatisfie God; or to make a Sinner acceptable to Him; Prayer is no Sin-offering; Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Convictions, a blameleſs Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are no Sin-offerings; theſe things are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty, and unſignificant, as to the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sinner, or the obtaining of his Pardon- 2. Upon the other ſide, it points out the abſolute neceſſity of making uſe of Chriſt's Sacrifice, and of the betaking of our ſelves to it, for the ſatisfying of Gods Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, if there be a neceſſity of the pardon of Sin, and of the removing of Wrath; there is then ſure a neceſſity of cloſing with Chriſt, and His Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>The 1. of theſe <hi>Uſes</hi> ſpeaks to two ſorts of Perſons, with whom the Word of God hath no weight, and who, in effect thinks to ſatisfie God with nothing. 1. a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, graceleſs, ſecure Company, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God keeps ſilence, are diſpoſed to think that He is like themſelves, and that He will never purſue a quarrell againſt them,; much like to that Man ſpoken of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.18, 19. <hi>Who ſayes in his heart he ſhall have peace though he walk in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of his own heart, adding drunknneſs to thirst.</hi> We have a Generation of this ſort among us, who tuſh at all threatnings, (alas for them, O! that God would be graciouſly pleaſed to make a change on them, or if that may not be, that He would rid us of them,) Who will needs live ſenſually, and as they liſt, who will needs ſpeak, and do as they pleaſe, and will not be controlled; and yet at the firſt hand, will boldly and confidently aſſert their hope of Heaven, as if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been Sinners; whence comes this? even from their ſuppoſing, that there is another way to Heaven, then God hath Chalked out; they think they may be ſaved, though they never betake themſelves to Chriſt for Union with Him? but whether ſhal their Sentence or God's ſtand? There is a day coming, when ye ſhall know; ye ſay ye ſhall have Peace, but God ſayes, No, Why ſo? Becauſe ye never knew what it was to make uſe of Chriſt; ye had never ſo much as a Form, nor any the leaſt Guſt of Religion, but were, and are ſtill as ſenſleſs as the Stones in the Wall: what do ye think will become of this? God urges as it wete, the offers of Chriſt upon you, and ye ſtill ſlight Him; He tells you, that there is a neceſſity of Union with Him; elſe ye ſhall never ſee Heaven; and ye lye ſtill at a diſtance from Him, and yet will needs hope for Heaven; but alas! it will not be ſo with you: either think on the right way, which is by putting Chriſt in in your Room, and laying of Religion to the heart in ſad earneſt; or dream not of coming to Heaven. A 2d Sort are they, who are not altogether ſo prophane as the others, but will condemn them, (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the practice of many is loathſome) they will, it may be Pray in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and will not be Drunk, neither will they Swear nor Lye, and they will walk blameleſly; and upon theſe grounds, they promiſe Heaven to themſelves, very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently; and yet they come not through the ſenſe of their ſinfull and curſed State, by Nature, to cloſe with Chriſt by Faith, and to make uſe of His Sacrifice; ſuch err on the other hand. Oh! when ſhall we be at this, not to neglect the ſtudy of Holineſs, and yet not to reſt on it, to the prejudice of this one Offering: This were a a practice ſuitable to, and worthy of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Goſpel; to be ſeriouſly aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all Duties of Holineſs that are called for; and yet to be building all their expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of any good from God, on the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt alone; never coming to God without bring it along with them, and looking through it to be accepted before Him; there n eds no more, and no other thing that we can bring, will do our turn, nor be taken off our hand, if this be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected. The Lord Himſelf teach us this way.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> which we propoſed to be ſpoken to, the laſt day was this, That Jeſus Chriſt is the only Sin-offering, by which Sin can be taken away, and God ſo Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as to forbear the Puniſhment of the Sinner, and to admit him to Peace, and Friendſhip with Him; If we would Enum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erat all things imaginable, and Invent Wayes and Means without number to remove Sin, or to make a Sinners Peace with God; there is no other Means but this, that will do it, As we have it <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. Chriſt Jeſus by <hi>his once offering up of himſelf, perfects for ever theſe who are ſanctified;</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 4. <hi>There is no other name given under heaven, whereby ſinners can be ſaved, but the name of Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> is, To Commend, and to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrat to us all, the neceſſity of the Uſe making of this one Offering of Chriſt; if He be the one Offering to take away Sin, and if no other will be accepted; then there is a neceſſity, that He, in His Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Himſelf be made uſe of; If all be under Sin, and if by the Law, Sin and Death, be knit inſeperably together (as it is ſaid, <hi>the wages of ſin is death</hi>) and if Freedom from Sin and Wrath, and Peace with God, be neceſſary; then there is a neceſſity, that Sinners be ſerious in this matter, to get a Title to, and Intereſt in this one Offering, and Sacrifice of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In the proſecuting of the <hi>Uſe,</hi> we ſhall ſpeak a little to theſe four things. 1. To ſome Grounds. or Reaſons, to ſhew the Neceſſity of Sinners uſe making, of Chriſt's Sacrifice, or Offering. 2. To this, what it is to make uſe of this Offering. 3. We ſhall give a Word of Advertiſement, as to ſome miſtakes that are about it. 4. We ſhall give ſome Differencing Characters, or Evidences, of a Perſon that is making right Uſe of this Offering, for obtaining of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and for making of this Peace with God.</p>
            <pb n="311" facs="tcp:152256:158"/>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> That is, the Reaſons to evince the neceſſity of it, The 1. of them is, that which we hinted at juſt now, If Men were not lying under Sin, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Wrath, and if there were any other Sin-offering, or any other Way, or Mean, to eſcape the Curſe and Wrath of God due for Sin; there were no ſuch neceſſity: But ſeing that all Men are under. Sin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curſe of God and His Wrath, becauſe of it, and ſeing there is no other thing that can take away Sin; then there is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, ſeriouſly to make uſe of, and to have an Intereſt in this Sin-offering. 2. Conſider, that the great part of Men in the World, and even of them that hears this Goſpel, do not indeed make uſe of this Offering, though they be ſome way under the Conviction that they are Sinners, and that this is the only Sin offering to take away Sin, and we ſuppoſe, if ye were all put to it, ye could not deny, but ye are Sinners, and that nothing can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Sin, but Chriſt's Offering up of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a Sacrifice to ſatisfie Juſtice; Though ſome be that groſly ignorant, that they will ſpeak of ſome other thing; yet generally theſe that own and maintain the Truth of the Goſpel, are under a Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that no other thing can take away Sin; and yet even amongſt theſe, there are many that never make uſe of Chriſt, and of His Sacrifice to take away their Sins, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Wrath, and make their Peace with God: There were many <hi>Jews,</hi> who by the dayly Sacrifices, which Typed forth this one Offering of Chriſt, were taught, that there was no other way to come by Pardon, and Peace with God, but there uſe making of it; and yet the moſt part of them, in going about theſe Sacrifices, were ſlighters of this one Sacrifice; Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſayes of them, <hi>Rom.</hi>

Conſider, that though there be many of the hearers of the Goſpel, who do not reſt on Chriſt, yet it is very hard to convince any of them that they are ready to ſlight Chriſt's Sacrifice: I am ſure that both the former will be granted. 1. That nothing but Chriſts Sacrifice can Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Juſtice; 2. That many do not reſt on it, and ſo periſh, but if we come to the 3. Sarcely ſhall we find one that will grant (except it be a tender Bodie,) that they make not uſe of Him; they will eaſily be convinced, that Adultery is a Sin, and that they are guilty of it, if they be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that Drunkenneſs, and Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking are Sins; yea, poſſibly, (which is more) that vaging of the Mind in Duties of Worſhip is a Sin, and that they are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it; but it is not ſo eaſie to convince them that they are guilty of the Sin of not making uſe of Chriſt, and of His Sacrifice; nay they are ſo puft up with a good opinion of themſelves, that they will laugh at ſuch a Challenge; And hence it is, that ſo few make uſe of Chriſt's Sacrifice, and of His Righteouſneſſe, becauſe ſo few are convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That theſe will not take Chriſt's firſt anſwer, <hi>I know you not;</hi> what (as if they ſaid) knows thou not us? <hi>we have eaten and drunken in thy preſence,</hi> we have profeſſed Faith in thee, and our hope to get Heaven by thy Righteouſneſs; and yet He ſhall anſwer them again peremptorly, <hi>depart from me, I know you not,</hi> Not that there will be much to do, or any great difficulty to convince folk in that day, or any room left to debate the buſineſſe; but He would tell us by this, that many die in this Deluſion; And if it be a thing that Folks are ſo hardly convinced of, had they not need to be ſeriouſly ſollicitous, that they be not deceived, and diſappointed? 4. Conſider how ſad the diſappointment wil be to Sinners, on day, when they ſhall be brought to acknowledge, that they knew that there was no other Name given where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Sinners could be ſaved, but the Name of Jeſus, and yet that they ſlighted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Him; ye that never ſeriouſly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed compting and reckoning with God, do ye think on this; and that the paſſing of the Sentence will be upon this ground; to wit, whether ye have fled to Jeſus Chriſt, and made uſe of His Sacrifice, or not? will it not be a ſad diſappointment, to meet with a dolefull <hi>depart from me,</hi> on this ground; becauſe though there was ſome Conviction, that this was the only Sacrifice, and Sin-offering, that takes away Sin; that yet it was not made uſe of, nor made the ground of your Peace with God?</p>
            <p>But to the 2. What is it then to make uſe of this Offering? I know no better way then to explain it from the Typical Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, that were under the Law; and we may take it up in theſe three. 1. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes a through Conviction of Folks lyable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leneſſe to the Juſtice of God for Sin, and in an utter inability in our ſelves, and an utter emptineſs, and impotencie in all other Means to ſatisfie for Sin; thus they that brought the Sacrifice to the Prieſt, laid their hands on the head of the Beaſt, by which they acknowledged, that Death was due unto them. So then to have the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſe of the due deſert of Sin; that is, to have the Sentence of Death carried about in our Boſom, to have the through Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the emptineſſe of all other Means of relief, is requiſit to the right uſe making of Chriſt's Offering. 2. It implyeth this, that there be a look had to the Inſtitution, and Ordinance of God, appointing this Sacrifice to be the Mean of the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sinners; Therefore in theſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that were Offered for Sin, there was a reſpect had to Gods Covenant; wherein were not only Promiſes relating to External Cleanſing, and to Admiſſion to Church-priviledges; but Promiſes alſo, relating to inward Cleanſing, and to the Pardon of Sin, which was the great End of theſe Sacrifices; and the looking to the Inſtitution of this Sacrifice, is the Ground that leads us in to take up the end of Chriſts Sufferings, and is a warrand for our Faith, in the uſe mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof; being the only Sacrifice that expiats Sin, and holds off Wrath; and if theſe two things be not carried along in the uſe making of this Sacrifice, to wit, the Conviction of Sin, and of the lyableneſs to Wrath; and Gods Inſtitution and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of this Sacrifice, to take away Sin, and to avert Wrath, our Uſe making of it is, but Will-worſhip. 3. It implyes this, that when the Sinner is walking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſe of his Sin, and of the Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and Ineffectualneſſe of all other things, to remove Sin and Wrath, (as <hi>David</hi> hath it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.16. <hi>Thou deſireſt not ſacrifice, thou delighteſt not in burnt offerings;</hi>) There muſt be a looking to the Worth of Chriſt, and of His Sacrifice, that is appointed to take away Sin, and hold off Worth; and the Soul's actuall applying of it ſelf to His Offering, and the applying of His Offering to it Self; as we may ſee, in the 4, 5, 6. and 16. Chapters of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> where there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sacrifices appointed to be Offered, for ſeveral Sins, and particularly that of the <hi>Scape goat;</hi> on the head whereof, the Prieſt for the People was to lay his hands: in which was implyed, not only their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of Sin; and of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of Death; and of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that to be a Typical Offering for
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:152256:159"/> the Typical taking away of Sin; but theſe two things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urder were implyed. 1. That they did take the Burden of their Sins, which neither they themſelves, nor any other could bear, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> laid it on Chriſt; when Juſtice did put at them for their Debt, (to ſpeak ſo) they drew a Bill on Chriſt, as their Cautioner, to anſwer it; and as they did put the Debt in His hand, to be payed by Him; ſo they Lippened and Truſted the weight of their Souls to Him, and to no other: So that when God was purſuing them for their Debt; ſaying, as it were, I will have Payment of you, or elſe ye muſt Die; they brought the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the Prieſt, to pleaſe God Typically with an Eye to Chriſt Typifyed thereby; Even ſo for Sinners, to make uſe of Chriſt's Sufferings, is in the thorow Conviction of Sin, and of deſerved Wrath; to flie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus Chriſt, and to put Him in their Room; being Content and Deſirous, that He be their Cautioner, and undertake for them, and Satisfie for their Debt; yea, puting Him Actually to it, to pay their Debt, So that they have no other Anſwer to any Challenge for Sin, but this the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner that I have betaken my ſelf to, and put in my Room, will pay this Debt, and anſwer for it: The 2. Act of Faith, is, this, when they have betaken themſelves to Him, and to His Sacrifice, they Acqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſce in, and Reſt upon it alone, for obtaining of the Sentence of Abſolution; which was alſo implyed in the People, their laying their Hands by the Prieſt, on the Head of the Sacrifice; For as it implyed, their acknowledging that they could not Pleaſe, nor Satisfie Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor by any other Way or Mean; ſo it Implyed, that according to God's Covenant, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected His Abſolving of them, becauſe of that Sacrifice; and that, though they were Deſperat by themſelves to Satisfie, yet that they had Faith in God's Covenant, that the Sacrifice they Offered, would Typically Satisfie Him; Even ſo the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever draws the Concluſion from Chriſt's Sacrifice, according to the Terms of the Covenant, that He hath Abſolution; and reſts on, and acquieſces in it; and this is called <hi>Truſting,</hi> or <hi>Confiding</hi> in Chriſt; when not only he caſteth himſelf on Him; but hath Confidence, that the Bill which He hath drawn on him will be Anſwered by Him, which is founded on the Covenant; In which it's ſaid, of all that come unto me, I will put none away; As it is, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>Him that cometh to me, I will in no wayes caſt out;</hi> and <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. <hi>There is a fountain opened in the houſe of David, for ſin, and for uncleanneſs;</hi> On which ground, Believers expect the benefit of Waſhing, on their performing of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant: And when <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.7. Prayes, <hi>purge me, waſh me,</hi> It holds out the Act of Faith, drawing the Bill on Chriſt; And when he ſayes, <hi>I ſhall be clean, and white as ſnow:</hi> It holds out his Confident Reſting on, and acquieſcing in Chriſt for Cleanſing; And this is the reaſon, why ſome expreſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t to dare to Compt, and Reckon with Juſtice, nay, not to dare as it were, to Compt with Chriſt; but leaving Chriſt in the ſtour (to ſpeak ſo,) and running away from Reckoning with Juſtice; to hide our ſelves under Him, who can count to the utmoſt Farthing; Even as when God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and and when he was lifting his hand to ſlay him, there came a Voice from Heaven, <hi>Abraham hold thy hand,</hi> and a Ram is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If it be ſo very difficult, and yet ſo abſolutly neceſſary to make Uſe of Chriſt; and eſpecially in His Offering up of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for the Sin of His People; there is ground here for Warning, and Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to walk tenderly in this Matter, that this Sacrifice be not flighted, that this One Offering be not Neglected, as we would not have Sin lying at our Door. And here we ſhall point at three ſorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who may be counted ſlighters and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecters of this Offering. The 1. Sort are theſe, who think to make their Peace with God, without minding the neceſſity of the interveening of any thing betwixt Him and them; and theſe go on ſeverall Grounds, or are of ſeveral Sorts. 1. Some are utterly careleſſe how their Peace be made, or whether it be made or not, they hope for it, and think to come at it, but cannot give an account whether they will come at it or not; and they are careleſs to know the way. 2. Others go upon their preſumption; They think God loves them, becauſe they love themſelves; and though they know they have Sin, yet they think God will not be ſo ill as to Reckon with them; They think they are ſure that God loves them, but they cannot give a ground for it. 3. Others think, God is mercifull, and therefore they conclude, that they will be Pardoned; They cannot conceive God to be like Man in His Mercy; but to be far beyond Him (as indeed He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, in ſome reſpect) and therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, when Man is mercifull, he ſometime ſeeks no Satisfaction; So neither will God think they; Not conſidering, that though God be merciful, That yet He will not ſhew mercie to the prejudice of His Juſtice; but will needs have it Satisfied; Such think on the Matter at leaſt, that they would have gotten mercy, though Chriſt had never died; It is true, if God had not been mercifull, never a Sinner had gotten mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; yet that is not the ground of His ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy; Otherwayes all the World might expect mercy; For He is, and ever was Gracious and mercifull in Himſelf; and therefore there muſt be ſome other Ground and Way for obtaining of Pardon; elſe it cannot be expected, becauſe of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone Simple, and Abſtract conſideration of His Mercy; And yet many will needs expect it on this Ground, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Mediators Purchaſe. A 2. Sort, are they that take a Legall way for making of their Peace with God; Not, as if they thought to appear before God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin, and Holy, as the Covenant of Works requireth; but if they Sin, they will make a mends; and it's either ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Negative, that they have not done, or ſomething Poſitive, that they have done; or ſome Internal Qualification, that they reſt upon. 1. Something Negative, they have not been ſo ill as other Folks, and if they go to Hell, they think few will go to Heaven; They have done wrong to none; and if they were about to Die, they think, and it may be ſay, that they will leave a good Name behind them, on the account of their harmleſs Walk; like that <hi>Phariſee</hi> they can ſay, <hi>Lord I thank thee, I am not like other men, nor like this Publican:</hi> They are no Drunkards, no Oppreſſors, they neither Curſe nor Swear; and when they ſee any prophane Perſons, they are puft up, with a good Opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe they are not as prophane as they. Or 2. They will come a furder Length, and poſitively do many Duties upon which they reſt, and whereof they are ready to boaſt, with that ſame <hi>Phariſee</hi> who vaunted, <hi>I faſt twice a week, I give tithes of all I poſſeſſe;</hi> If any Dutie be performed, or any good be done by them; their Fingers are ready (to ſay ſo) to ſtick to it: But 3. and eſpecially, if there be any inward Work, as if there be any Liberty, or Motion of the affections in Prayer, if there be at hearing the Word, ſome Convictions ſharper at one time then at another, if there be any ſort of Repentance, Ruing, and Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe they think will do their turn: It is moſt certain, and might be cleared, both from the Word of God, and from Experience, that many hundreds of Profeſſors Daſh, and Periſh
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:152256:160"/> on this Stumbling Block, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 48.1.2. Where the Lord is ſpeaking of a People, <hi>that made mention of his name, and ſware by him, but not in truth, nor in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> of whom He ſayes, that <hi>they call</hi> and count <hi>themſelves of the holy citie, and ſtay themſelves upon the God of Iſrael;</hi> and the Ground of it is, their reſting on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Duties of Faſting and Prayer, and the like: expectations of Happineſs, grounded on ſome feckleſs performances, cut the Throats of many Civil and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Men, that are not groſly prophane. A 3d. Sort, do not altogether ſlight and neglect Chriſt Himſelf, but they ſlight and neglect His Offering; as if they would in a manner make uſe of Himſelf, but not of His Sacrifice, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. and <hi>Mark</hi> 10. There is a Man ſpoken of, that comes to Chriſt, would fain be at Heaven; and aſkes <hi>good maſter, what ſhall I do, that I may inherit eternal life;</hi> and yet he was going on the Grounds of his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; this is exceeding ſubtile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull; And therefore ye would take the better Notice of it; and how it is fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: A man may come to Chriſt, as God for Pardon of Sin; (and ſome think though moſt Ignorantly, and Erroniouſly, that Chriſt the Son is more compaſſionat, and ready to Pardon then the Father) and may ſeek Pardon from Him; but not for His ſake, or on His account; for there is a difference betwixt making Chriſt the object of our Worſhip; and making uſe of Him as Mediator; There are many that have prayed to Chriſt as God, and ſought Pardon of Sin from Him; who never pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obtain Pardon, by vertue of His Offering; Folk may alſo deſire help from Chriſt, to inable them to do Duties, that they may thereby work out the work of their own Salvation; and be helped this way to make their peace with God; who do not ground the making of their Peace with God on His Offering alone; Theſe things are exceeding frequent in Peoples Practice; who will pray to Chriſt for ſuch and ſuch things, and yet not found their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of them upon His Offering, or His Righteouſneſs; If we would make uſe Chriſt's Offering, Singly and Rightly we would eſchew theſe, and all other wrong wayes.</p>

It may be aſked then, what are the Evidences, that may give a Perſon ſome clearneſs, that he is making uſe of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs aright, and that it is not his own Righteouſneſſe; nor the making uſe of Chriſt only as He is God; that ſuſtains him, I anſwer, that this is indeed a Miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and will require ſearching, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obſerve our own Condition; And moe things concurre then one or two, to make a full diſcovery of it; In ſpeaking to this, as we deſire to ſtrengthen the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of none; So we ſhall labour to ſhun the weakning of the Faith of any Sound Believer. There are then theſe <hi>Six</hi> or <hi>Seven</hi> Differencing Evidences, or Characters of a Perſon, that is rightly making uſe of Chriſt's Offering; which Difference Him from others; And 1. one that truely makes uſe of Chriſt's Offering hath not only been brought to ſee his need of It; but his Natural Propenſion, and Readineſſe to miſken it, and reſt upon other things beſide it, for the making of his Peace; Whereas another Man, who does not rightly make uſe of it, though he may ſee his Sin, and ſo his need of it; yet he ſees not, neither will take with the Tendencie, Propenſneſs and Inclination of his Heart, to reſt upon ſome other thing beſide it; See this difference in <hi>Paul,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after Converſion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was Converted, he ſtudied, as he thought all the Righteouſneſſe of the Law; and no doubt offered Sacrifices which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the acknowledgement of Sin; and he thought that all was well with him; Therefore he ſayes, <hi>touching the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the Law, he was blameleſſe;</hi> and verſe 6. <hi>Theſe things that were gain to me;</hi> Or theſe things that I placed my Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in; I thought the moe Sacrifices that I offered, I had the more to buy my Peace by; He ſees, that in his ſtudying of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he was ſeeking to make a Stock in himſelf: But after his Converſion, he caſts all theſe, as to leaning to them, or making them any ground of his Peace with God,

Some that are content with Sin, and make lies their refuge. 2. Others that are ſatisfied with Dutie, if it go well with them, and promiſe themſelves acceptance on that alone Account neglecting Chriſt; but the Believer hath (as I juſt now ſaid) on exerciſe of Faith, how to be quite of Sin; and another new exerciſe of it, how to be fred from reſting on Duty; and how to be ſingly ingadged unto, and to reſt upon Chriſt: is mind is not quiet in all his Duties, till he come hither, even to be found in Chriſt, not having his own R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, but His; It's a good token, when Folks are not only exerciſed to have Sin Mortified, and Duties going with them, but alſo to have their Peace with God grounded on Chriſt, and not on Dutie; Hence it is, that a Chriſtian will ſometimes be taken up a whole day in Dutie, and yet have but little, or no Peace, becauſe he
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:152256:161"/> would be over, and through all Duties to reſting on Chriſt, which he wins not at to his Satisfaction. 4ly. One that is ſingle in uſe making of Chriſt, and of His Offering, hath a fear of miſtaking this Offering of Chriſt; and that ſome other thing be put in His Room, and He miſkent, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected: There will not be only a fear, leaſt he Sin, and come ſhort in the ſuitable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch a Duty; and leaſt he fall under Wrath but alſo Fear and Jealouſie, leaſt in his Unbelief, and Selfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he going wrong in the uſe making of Chriſt, and of His Sacrifice; as is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. Where the Apoſtle having ſpoken of many of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> their Unbelief in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſayes, in the beginning of this; <hi>Let us therefore fear, leaſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of us ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it,</hi> to wit, through Unbelief; Be Holily Jealous (as if he had ſaid) <hi>least,</hi> as it is <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>There be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God;</hi> In a word, he will be ſuſpecting the exerciſe of his Faith, as much as any thing; a Naturall Man will ſometimes it may be, ſuſpect his Duties, but hardly will he be brought to ſuſpect his Faith, otherwayes he could not have the peace that he hath, ſuch as it is: This may alſo be Confirmed, from that poor mans prayer to Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. <hi>Lord, I believe, help my unbelief.</hi> He dare not well truſt his own Faith. 5ly. They that are ſingle in their uſe making of Chriſt's Offering, not only ſee themſelves Sinners, but they carrie along with them the diſcovery of the naughtineſſe of every thing that is beſt in them; when they ſee that to which others lippen to ſo much, ſo very unſuitable, and that they are far ſhort of that which they ſhould be at; they dare not own, nor look on it to boaſt of it; but it's a burden to them, to ſee ſo much Sin in it; It's nothing to ſee Sin in ſome outward Actions, and in that which is directly contrary to Gods Law; but it's much to ſee Sin in our beſt things, as in our Faith in God; in our Love to Him; and in our ends in Holy Duties; A Legal Man will confeſs it may be readily, that he Sins in every thing; but he covers all with this, that he hath a good heart to God, or a good end: The Believer on the contrary, ſees all his good ſo naughty, that it is taſteleſs to him; He never gets any thing to reſt on, or that can bear his weight to confide in, till he come to Chriſt's Sacrifie:</p>
            <p n="6">6ly. Such as are aiming rightly to make uſe of Chriſt's Offering and Sacrifice, eſteem, and think exceeding much of it; Therefore they adventure Heaven, and their Eternal Salvation on it; It's that which cheers and delights them moſt, that Chriſt hath ſtepped in and ingadged to do that for them, which neither themſelves nor any other Perſon or thing could do; <hi>The life</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.) <hi>that I now live in the fleſh, is by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came to the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am the chief.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> heartſomlie, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7. <hi>To him that loved us, and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from our ſins in his own blood,</hi> &amp;c. But they that endeavour not, neither aim rightly to make uſe of Chriſts Sacrifice, think little or nothing of it; They are not made glad, nor are their hearts lifted up with Spiritual Joy, becauſe of it: The good and glad news of a ſlain Saviour, are not the chief ground of their Conſolation, as they are to the Believer: This evidence is ſomewhat general, yet ſure as well as the former. O! but it's matter of much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to the Believer, when he thinks how that when the Stroak of Juſtice was ready to come on him; Chriſt ſhould have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed betwixt him and that Fatal, and Deadly Blow; But others eſteem not of it, and therefore cannot make uſe of it. 7ly. They that are rightly making uſe of Chriſt's Sacrifice, find it to be a difficult thing, and that which will coſt them wraſtling to get it made uſe of aright: they breath after it, and yet win not to that which they would be at in it; O! as <hi>David</hi> cryes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>purge me with hyſop, and I ſhall be clean, waſh me, and I ſhall be white as ſnow.</hi> They know not well what way to make uſe of it to their Satisfaction, they would make
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:152256:162"/> ſo much uſe of it; or how to vent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their Faith on it; and when it comes to Actual Believing, and to the Acting of their Faith, they find it to be like a ſmooth and ſlippery Stone, that they cannot eaſily hold their Feet on. So <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>I count all things but dung, that I may win Christ and that I may be found in him:</hi> He cared not what he caſt over board, that he might win to that Land, even to Chriſt and His Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: Like Sea men in great hazard, who caſt all over board, to win the Shoar; It's even ſo with the Believer, He ſees that there is ſuch hazard to go wrong, and that It's ſo difficult to be right, even to make the heart ſubmit to the way of Faith, and to abide by it Singly, that he is content to ſuffer the loſs of all things, if he may be right here: But on the contrary, a Man that reſts on his own Righteouſneſſe, be a difficultie what will to him, Faith is no difficulty to him: <hi>He</hi> may have fear to come ſhort of Heaven ſometimes; but he thinks that he is alwayes exerciſing his Faith: In a word, the Believer ordinarly believes beſt, when he hath the deepeſt, and moſt kindly impreſſion of his Sin, as for the Legall Man, he can believe well, as he thinks, when he hath no challenge for Sin; but when he is challenged for Sin, his Faith faills him. Now from all that hath been ſaid, ye may ſee the neceſſity of making uſe of this Sacrifice: And how warrily, and cautiouſly it ſhould be done; that ye may ſteer a ſtraight Courſe between groſs Prophanity, and Preſumption, either of which will ruine and deſtroy the Soul: The Lord Jeſus Himſelf be your Steers-man, and Pilot, that ye by His Skilfull Conduct may Stemme the Port, and hold off theſe Rocks, on which thouſands of Souls Split, and make Ship-wrack.</p>

            <p>SIn was eaſily brought into the World, a little buſineſſe brought in Sin, and the Curſe and Wrath of God with it; and without any great difficulty, Men can continue in Sin, and lye under Gods Wrath and Curſe; but the taking away of Sin; and the Satisfying of the Juſtice of God for it, is no eaſie matter; (that if we may ſo ſpeak,) did put Heaven and Earth both to it; There was ſuch a contrivance of this way, and ſuch a mean choſen, and made uſe of, that Sin might be removed, and the Curſe taken away, as the like was never heard of.</p>
            <p>The Intimation and Manifeſtation of this Way, is in the firſt part of this Verſe, <hi>Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him;</hi> In Gods Council, and by His Pleaſure it was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, and the Way found out; and the Mean is ſet down, in theſe Words, <hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin;</hi>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:152256:162" rendition="simple:additions"/> The Mediator, even he who was the Spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Lamb of God, in whoſe Mouth was found no Guile, was bruiſed, and put to ſad Suffering, to get this Effectuat; That the Curſe might be removed from Sinners, He was made the Sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>We ſhew that Jeſus Chriſt is the only Sin-offering, by which Sin is taken away; and that it is implyed here; So that it is denyed to all other Things, or Means to have any Effecacie, Vertue, or Merit in them, as to the removing of Sin, and the Curſe brought on by it; this is, I ſay, ſo peculiarly applyed to Chriſt's Offering; that it is denyed to every thing elſe; which ſhews 1. How much Sinners are oblidg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt, who, when no other thing could do it, interpoſed Himſelf. 2. The neceſſity of making uſe of this one Offering, without which never Soul can be Perfected or Saved: He is the alone Foundation of Sinners Peace, and of all the Conſolation that they can have in the Promiſes of God.</p>
            <p>Now to proceed, and to hint at ſome few things more from the Words; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the End and Nature of Chriſt's Sufferings are ſet forth: He in His Suffering, and Offering up of Himſelf; did ſtep into the Room of the Sinfull Elect, that by Juſtice exacting of Him the Debt that was due by them; they might eſcape, and be ſet free; Hence <hi>Obſerve.</hi> 1. That when there was no other Thing, nor Mean, that could ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſatisfie Divine Juſtice, or be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for Sin; Our Lord ſtepped to, and undertook, and became the Sacrifice to take away Sin; according to that often cited <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. <hi>Sacrifice, and offering thou didſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, in burnt offering thou hadst no pleaſure:</hi> He is not ſpeaking of what God required in the Law, as Typicall; for He required Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Offerings in that reſpect; but not to be a Propitiation for the Sins of the Elect World, becauſe they could not do it; and then follows, <hi>Lo I come,</hi> or I am here: <hi>mine ear hast thou bored,</hi> It is <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: <hi>A body haſt thou given unto me:</hi> which ſets out His being put in a Capacity to be a Sacrifice; <hi>I delight to do thy will, O my God.</hi> Here there are theſe Four Things implyed. 1. A lyableneſs in the Elect to the Juſtice of God for Sin; and as to all other Means and Wayes of Relief, but by this One Sacrifice, a Diſperatneſs and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility; and conſidering the Sentence, which God had Pronunced; <hi>The day thou eats, thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> And <hi>curſed is every one that continues not in all things written in the Law to do them;</hi> No Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice can be accepted but this only; Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Rams, and ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyl have no acceſs; He did not in that reſpect, require theſe, neither would He capitulat on theſe Terms. 2. That when no other Sacrifice could do the turn, Chriſt Jeſus came in, and was content to interpoſe, and to be the Sacrifice for Sin, <hi>Lo,</hi> ſaith He, <hi>I come,</hi> I am here ready to Satisfie for my Elect People; For this is an Old Deſign, and He had undertaken from Eternity to carry it on. 3. There is implyed here a great Willingneſſe, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome, and Heartſome Condeſcending in the Mediator, to be the Sacrifice, He ſteps in affectionatly, in the Room of the Elect, as the Sacrifice for them, to receive the Stroak of Juſtice, that they may eſcape and go free. <hi>I delight to do thy will, O my God:</hi> This is Gods Will, as to the Work of Redemption, as it is, <hi>John</hi> 6.38. <hi>I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have finiſhed the work thou gaveſt me to do;</hi> That <hi>will</hi> and <hi>this work</hi> is all one; And <hi>Heb,</hi> 10. It's ſaid by which (or by this) <hi>will we are ſanctified.</hi> 4. The Fathers admitting and accepting of Him, to Interpoſe in the Room of them, for whom He Offered Himſelf, is implyed here; for otherwayes His Offering up of Himſelf, could not have been a Sacrifice Satisfactory to Juſtice, if the Lord Jehovah had not been content ſo far, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Could we ſuitably make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry what caſe we were in, under the hand of Juſtice, and it's Stroak ready to light on us; And could we behold our Lord Jeſus Chriſt Interpoſing for us, and the Sword of Juſtice awaking againſt Him, and ſmiting Him for us; and the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah accepting of His Interpoſing, and making His Soul an Offering for Sin; And Him Willingly; and Delightſomly Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Himſelf in our Room; we would ſee our obligation to God, who was pleaſed to contrive, admit, and accept of this Way, and Mean of our Redemption; And could we conſider, what a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As for the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe, to wit, That our Lord Jeſus, in His Dying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was Properly the Propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; or is Properly a Propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the taking away of Sin? To clear it alittle, we would conſider. 1. That Sacrifices are ſundry wayes taken in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 1. Sometimes they are taken im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly for Duties; as Alms, Prayers, Praiſes, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>The ſacrifice of a broken heart thou wilt not diſpiſe?</hi> So alſo

               <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15, 16. 2. They are taken more properly for ſuch Sacrifices as were Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Law; as of Bullocks, Lambs Rams, and Goats; yet none of theſe was the true Propitiatory Sacrifice, as is clear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.4. <hi>It was impoſſible that the blood of bulls, and goats could take away ſin.</hi> But Chriſt's Sacrifice is properly the Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory Sacrifice; It being by this Sacrifice, that Believers under the Old Teſtament became part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That there be ſome thing, or matter ſet a part to be Offered to God, in the Room of ſome other thing, as it was in the Typicall Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. 2.

Therefore the Sinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved either to die himſelf, or to have another to die for him, and in his Room. 4. The Sacrifice behoved to be Offered according to the manner preſcribed by God, as to all the Rites and Cerimonies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.

As there behoved to be One, to Offer the Sacrifice, ſo Chriſt Jeſus is the Prieſt, that Offered up the Sacrifice of Himſelf: He is not only the Sacrifice, but the Prieſt; And in this He differed from other Prieſts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>Such an high Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, ſeperat from ſinners, and made higher then the heavens;</hi> and then follows, <hi>who needs not dayly, as theſe high prieſts, to offer up ſacrifices; firſt for their own ſins, and then for the ſins of the people; for this he did once, when he offered up himſelf.</hi> There are three things ordinarly Attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt, as to His Sacrifice, to wit, That He was the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> the <hi>Altar,</hi> and the <hi>Prieſt;</hi> 1. He was the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of His Humane Nature, which we are not ſo to look upon, as Abſtracting, and Dividing it from His Divine Nature; For though He Suffered in the Fleſh, yet it was the ſame Perſon, that was God that Suffered. 2, He was the <hi>Altar,</hi> by which His Sacrifice received a ſpeciall Efficacy, Vertue, Value, and Commendation; As it's ſaid, <hi>The Altar ſanctifies the offering:</hi> So Chriſt Jeſus, according to His God-head, was the Altar, which did put an ſpecial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency on His Sufferings, and made them to be of ſuch Worth and Value; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. It's ſaid, <hi>that he through the eternal ſpirit offered up himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot unto God;</hi> It was the Suffering of the Perſon that was God, that made the Sacrifice to be accepted. 3. He was the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and that according to both His Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs, each Nature concurring, and that joyntly, as in one Perſon, to the making of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>crifice Offered up to God acceptable. 3. We have in Him a reall deſtruction, but do not miſtake the Word; It is not ſo to be underſtood, as if He were annihilat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or had been utterly deſtroyed, and undone; but the meaning is this, That He was Killed, or put to Death, and His Soul ſeperat from His Body: in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, He ceaſed to be what He was before for a time; having been really Slain; Dead and Buried. And 4. All this was according to God's preſcription, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, in the Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>This commandement,</hi> (ſaith He, <hi>John</hi> 10.18.) <hi>have I received of my Father,</hi> to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:152256:164"/> wit, <hi>that</hi> I <hi>ſhould lay down my life for my ſheep;</hi> And moſt emphatically, He ſays, <hi>John</hi> 14.13. <hi>as my Father gave me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, even ſo;</hi> (mark, <hi>even ſo,</hi> moſt exactly, in conformity to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>do I:</hi> It was all, as to every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ordered according to the good pleaſure of God, who was pleaſed thus to bruiſe Him and to put Him to Grief.</p>
            <p>The 1. <hi>Uſe</hi> of it ſerves, To teach us, how to Conceive, and Conſider of Chriſt's Death, and Sufferings rightly, to wit, even as a Sacrifice deſigned by God, to come in the Room of Elect Sinners; and how to look upon His Death; not as the ordinary Death of ordinary or meer Men; who by neceſſity of Nature Die; but to look on it, as being appointed of God, to be a Sacrifice properly ſo taken, for the Sins of His People.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. This ſerves to clear ſome Truths, concerning our Lord Jeſus His Sacrifice; For we muſt conſider it, as ſatisfying to Juſtice, and Meritoriouſly procuring the eſcaping from Wrath, and Salvation of them for whom He Interpoſed: It is from the groſs Ignorance, or from the wicked denyal of this ground, that the damnable denyers of Chriſt's Satisfaction, do alſo deny the Propriety of His Sacrifice on Earth, and bound it to Heaven; whereas, it is bounded to His Death; though by vertue of this One Offering, He continues to interceed for us in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It teaches Sinners what is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Uſe</hi> which they ſhould make of this Sacrifice; They ſhould look upon it, as the only Sacrifice to prevent Eternal Death, and the Curſe of God; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſo it demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats to us, that either Jeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Chriſt muſt be received by Faith, and His Sacrifice reſted on; or we muſt reſolve to meet with Wrath, and the Curſe of God our ſelves in our own Perſons.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly. It ſerves to clear us anent the Way and Tract of Grace; to wit, how it came to paſſe, that our Lord, who was innocent, and without Sin, was ſo bruiſed, and put to grief: He came to be a Propiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion for the Sins of His People, and ſiſted Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in our Room, as our Cautioner, as a Sin-offering for us: It would doubtleſſe gnaſh many Queſtions, and Doubts, that ariſe in the Hearts of Believers, if it were well underſtood: They may ſay, we ſhould have been in ſuch and ſuch a ſad condition; this and that terrible thing would have come on us, if He had not Interpoſed; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enough can theſe words be ſpoken and thought of, that we have, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. He was made ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5ly. It ſerves for notable Conſolation to Believers, who have betaken themſelves to Chriſt, and have many Challenges for Sin to buckle with; That His Death was to be properly a Sacrifice for Sin; and was ſo accepted of God in their Room: So that ye ſee the right uptaking of Chriſts Death, is a matter of no little moment; <hi>Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi> being the very Subſtance of the Goſpel: It helps much, to keep alive the Impreſſion of our Sinfulneſs, and of the Goodneſs of God; and gives us Direction how to eſcape Wrath, by puting Him in our Room: There is nothing, wherein Folks more readily miſcarry, in making of their Peace with God, then in not making the right uſe of Chriſt, and of His Sacrifice, and Death: Some praying for Pardon of Sin from Him, and not for Him, or for His ſake, when they know not what they are ſaying, as we hinted at before; Some praying for ſtrength from Him for Dutie, that they may do for themſelves, not conſidering that we are Juſtified by His Interpoſing in our Room, and by Faith's cloſing with Him, under that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, as fiſting Himſelf at the Bar of Juſtice; and as being content to be a Sin-offering: and the Lord accepting of Him in the Room of Elect Sinners: This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well conſidered, gives to Faith much clearneſs how to take Him up, when the Soul honeſtly aims to partake of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of His Sufferings.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. For clearing this a little further, we would know, That there are (as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines obſerve) <hi>Four</hi> or <hi>Five</hi> wayes, how the Death of Chriſt is to be conſidered; or how Chriſt, in procuring by His Death Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:152256:164"/> Peace, and Pardon to Sinners is holden forth in Scripture. 1. He pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes Redemption, and Pardon of Sin, <hi>Meritoriouſly,</hi> or He <hi>Merits</hi> it by His Death; this Reſpects the Value of Chriſt's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Satisfaction: So that if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Chriſt in Himſelf, and the Elect in themſelves; His Death, and theſe Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, are more; then if all the Elect had Suffered Eternally in Hell. 2: His Death is conſidered, as a <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> And this looks to the Wrong, that Men by Sin have done to God: That the finit and feckleſs Creature durſt be ſo malapert as to break God's Command; It required a Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equivalent to the Wrong done; though the Word <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> be not in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet the <hi>thing</hi> is: Chriſt Jeſus, for the Reſtoring of God to His Honour, That was, as to the Manifeſtation of it, wronged by Mans Sin; comes in to perform the will of God, and to Satisfie, for the wrong done Him by Man; that it may be made known, that God is Holy and Juſt, who will needs avenge Sin on His own Son, the Holy and Innocent Cautioner; when He Interpoſes in the Room of the Sinner, which vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats the Spotleſs Juſtice, and Soveraignity of God as much, as, if not more, then if He had exacted the ſatisfaction off the Sinners themſelves: As it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.16. <hi>To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his righteouſneſs, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that believeth in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> 3 Chriſt's Death is conſidered as a <hi>Redemption</hi> of Man, from Sin, the Law, and the Curſe, becauſe lyable to a Debt which he cannot of himſelf pay; and His Death was in this reſpect a paying of the Debt, that Man was owing, and a looſing of the Captive and Impriſoned Sinner; even as when a Piece of Land is morgaged, and a Perſon comes in, and payes that for which it was Morgaged: So Jeſus Chriſt comes in, and as it were, aſks, what are theſe Men owing? and what is due to them? It's anſwered, they are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Death, and the Curſe are due to them; well, ſaith He, I will take their Debt on my Self, I will pay their Ranſom, by undergoing all that was due to them. <hi>He hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.) <hi>being made a curſe for us, that the bleſſing of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham might come on us Gentiles:</hi> And ſo Chriſt's Death in this reſpect is to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, as a laying down of the ſame Price, that Juſtice would have exacted of Men: His Death is the paying of our Ranſom, and Satisfying of the account that was over our head. 4. His Death is conſidered, as it furthered the Work of the Redemption of Elect Sinners, by a <hi>powerful annulling</hi> of the Obligation that was againſt us, and by a <hi>powerfull overcoming</hi> of all enemies that kept us Captive: He grapled and yocked with the Devil, in that wherein he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſtrongeſt, and overcame him; He tore the Obligation that ſtood over Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners heads, as it is, <hi>Coll.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>Blotting out the hand writting of ordinances that was againſt us, and that was contrary to us; he took it out of the way, nailing it to his croſs, and having ſpoiled principalities and powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in it:</hi> In this reſpect, though His Death be one of the loweſt ſteps of His Humiliation; yet conſidering Him, as in it, prevailling over the Devil, and other Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, He is to be looked on, as powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Working, and efficaciouſly perfecting our Salvation: In the former reſpect, He payes God the Debt that was due by Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; in the Latter Reſpect, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Devil, and Spiritual Enemies, as ſo many Jaylours, keeping Sinners Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, He, by His Death, wrings, as it were the Keyes out of their hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſets the Priſoners Free. 5. Chriſt's Death is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered (as it is in the Text, As an <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for Sin; In this reſpect, it looks to God as diſpleaſed with Man; and our Lord Jeſus Interpoſes to pacifie Him, and to make Him well pleaſed; and that by the means of His Death, God's Peace, Favour and Friendſhip may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to poor ſinfull Men: All theſe Conſiderations of the Death of Chriſt, are but one, and the ſame upon the matter; Yet thus diverſified, they ſerve to ſhew, how unexpreſſibly much Sinners are oblidged to Chriſt; what great advantag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:152256:165"/> they have by Him: And what a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, condition they are in, who are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Him; having nothing to ſatisfie Juſtice, nor to pay their Debt with.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. We ſaid, that this Sacrifice was eſpecially Offered by Him, in His Death; Therefore He is ſaid to Offer this Sacrifice on the Croſs. <hi>He himſelf,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> hath it, 1, 2.24. <hi>bare our ſins in his body, on the tree: Heb.</hi> 9. at the cloſe: And <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. It is ſaid, that <hi>he once offered up himſelf to bear the ſins of many, and by his once offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath perfected for ever, theſe who are ſanctified:</hi> So that this Offering is to be applyed to that which He ſuffered on Earth, before He aſcended; and it is in this reſpect, that He is a Propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: though, as I ſaid the Vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſtill communicated by Him, now when He is in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> This ſerves to remove two Errors, about Chriſt's Sacrifice. The 1. is that, which bounds and limits Chriſt's Offering, and Prieſt-hood to His going to Heaven, thereby to enervat the Efficacy of His Sufferings, and Death; quit contrary to this Scripture, wherein the Prophet expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating His Sufferings on Earth, calleth them <hi>an offering for ſin.</hi> The 2. is that Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Conceit, and Fancie of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who account their abominable <hi>Maſs,</hi> a Propitiatory Sacrifice, for taking away the Sins of the Quick, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Dead; which as it is moſt horrid Blaſphemy; So it is moſt expreſly againſt this Text: for if Chriſt's Sacrifice, for the taking away of Sin, be peculiarly applyed to His Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and Death; which brought with it ſuch a change, as made H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m not to be for a time what He was before: Then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there can be nothing of that now, which can bear that Name; there being no other thing, to which the properties of a real Sacrifice can agree, but this only. 3. I ſaid, that Chriſt's Offering up of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Sacrifice, was in His Soul as well as in Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>u in His hand, He Suffered not only in His Body, but alſo, and Mainly in His Soul, which the <hi>Jews</hi> could not reach; and He is here holden out, as a Sin-offering in His Soul, yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that it was the Wrath of God, and His Curſe due to the Elect, that He had to deal with, His Soul was more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be affected with it then His Body; Hence He ſayes, when no hand of Man touched Him, <hi>John</hi> 12.27. <hi>Now is my Soul troubled, and what ſhall I ſay?</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.38. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.44. <hi>Now is my ſoul exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death; and being in an agony he prayed, &amp;c.</hi> That which looked like ſtrong Armies muſtered, and drawn up againſt Him, was not the Souldiers that came to take Him, nor the Bodily Death, which was quickly to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; but it was the Fathers coming with His awakned Sword, to exact of Him the Debt due, by the Elect: And to be aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Him for their wrongs, and His being to ſtep in into their Room, and to be ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with that awaked, and furbiſhed Sword, and to Offer Himſelf the Sacrifice, as He had long before ingadged: Here O! here was the heat and ſtrength of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> This ſhews, 1. What a Dear Price Chriſt payed for Sinners. 2. The ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Juſtice of God, in exacting the Elects Debt of the Cautioner. 3. How much we are oblidged to the Cautioner, who, ſo willingly undertook the Debt, and was ſo ready to pay it, though it coſt Him not only External and Bodily Sufferings; but Soul-ſuffering, and put Him to encounter with Gods Curſe and Wrath: We are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, could we conceive, and ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of theſe Sufferings, that there is a great Myſtery here: And really it is a wonder, that we are not more affected wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>orious Perſon, as the Son of God, ſhould Interpoſe Himſelf; And that the Father ſhould ſpare the poor ſinfull Enemies, and make a way for them to eſcape, by the Diverting of His Juſtice from purſuing them, and by making it take hold of the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:152256:165"/> Son of His Boſom, Exacting the Debt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely from Him, O! what a wonder is this? That the Lord ſhould paſſe by the Enemy, and ſatisfie Himſelf of His own Son; Yea, that God ſhould take on Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the place of a Mid-man, and Satisfie Himſelf: That <hi>God ſhould be in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world to himſelf.</hi> This, this is the Wonder: Herein Infinit Wiſdom, Pure and Spotleſs Juſtice, Holineſs and Faithfulneſs, Grace and Mercy, to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of Men and Angels appear, and ſhine forth moſt Radiantly; It can hardly be known, in which of theſe the Glory of God ſhines moſt, in this Great and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Work of Redemption. But of them all, we may ſay to you Elect, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Sinners, what could our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus do more for your Salvation? I ſay, what, could He do more, then to Offer up Himſelf, a Propitiatory Sacrifice for your Sins? In the Goſpel, He calleth upon you to make uſe of it, that by Vertue of His Sacrifice, your Peace may be made with God; as it is, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an advocat with the Fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> and then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſins:</hi> This may give abundant ground to Sinners, to go upon, in their Application to God, for Pardon and Peace, even this, that He hath made Himſelf a Sacrifice, for ſeting of them free; For whom He Offered Himſelf a Sacrifice: O! Sinners admire Him, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy; and make uſe of His Moyen, and Court in Heaven; Improve, and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come theſe glad Tydings, and let it never be ſaid, nor heard of, that He was Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up a Sacrifice, and that ye would not admit of the benefit of it; that ye would not accept of Him, to be a Days-man, and Tryſter betwixt God and you, to remove all grounds of quarrel; O! for Chriſt's ſake, and as ye love your Souls, ſtep to, and ſeek Grace to make the right of uſe His Sacrifice, in order to the obtaining of the Pardon of your Sin, and the making of your Peace with God: Let Himſelf powerfully perſwade you to, and prevail with you, in this incomparably greatneſs of all concerns.</p>

            <p>WHere there is any Light and Knowledge of a God-head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men; There is this impreſſion on them, that it is a dreadful thing, to have a Contraverſie lying over betwixt God and them unremoved: And upon this ground it is, that as naturally the Conſcience doth challenge, for the provoking of God, ſo Men, according to the Light they have, are ſet on, to ſeek after this, and that, and the other Mean and Way, to get God appeaſed, and the Conſcience quieted; and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:152256:166"/> it's like that this hath deſcended to Men from <hi>Noah,</hi> that the moſt part of them have thought on the Mean of Sacrifices, by them to make their Peace with God; So the Lord taught the Family of <hi>Adam,</hi> after the Fail; and <hi>Noah</hi> renewed it, after his coming out of the Ark; and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable (as I ſaid) ſomewhat of this hath abiden with, and ſtuck to Men, even when they Degenerated, and Apoſtatized from God, and offered Sacrifices to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, though not intentionally, but unto God in their account: And indeed it is no marvel that Fleſh and Blood be here at a ſtand; and made to ſay, <hi>wherewithal ſhal we come before God?</hi> But we have this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the Goſpel; That in it, the Lord hath ſhewed to us, what it is that ſatisfieth Juſtice, and takes away Sin, and the Curſe; and that it is even this in the Text: <hi>Thou ſhalt make his foul an offering for ſin:</hi> There is no other thing that a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can bring with him, that can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, or that can make him to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God.</p>
            <p>We have hinted at ſome things from the Words already, and ſhew, that Chriſt's Sacrifice is called <hi>an offering for ſin,</hi> as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all others; and as expreſſing the Nature and Ends of it: We ſhall now ſpeak to one thing more, which is the 4th, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in this expreſſion; And it is this, That though Atonement and Satisfaction to God can be made by no other Sacrifice, or Offering, yet there is an Atonement and Satisfaction, that may be made by Chriſt's Offering: Hence He is called <hi>an offering for ſin:</hi> not only becauſe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluds all others, but alſo becauſe he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for that very end, as a Propitiation for the Sins of them, for whom He Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Offered Himſelf in a Sacrifice; as this is denyed to all other things (as we juſt now ſaid) ſo it is Applyed, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to Him, and His Offering, as, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>By the which will we are ſanctified, through the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, once for all. v.</hi> 12. <hi>This man after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſins, for ever ſat down on the right hand of God.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>For by one offering he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for ever, them that are ſanctified:</hi> This is the great thing that the Apoſtle aims at, in that Diſpute, not only to caſt the Leviticall Offerings, as to the removing of Sin and the Curſe, and making of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Peace with God; but to commend this <hi>one offering, as able to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost, all that come unto God through it:</hi> And according to this, we have that great Queſtion anſwered to poor Sinners; <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall ſhall we come before the Lord, and bow our ſelves before the moſt high God? He hath ſhewed, O! man, what is meet, and what the Lord requireth of thee.</hi> That there is nothing but this one Sacrifice of Chriſt, that will do the turn; and this wiil do it moſt infallibly, and moſt fully, as to the procuring of Pardon of Sin, and the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Peace with God; So that by the right making uſe of this Sacrifice, a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may moſt really expect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>emiſſion of Sins, and Peace with God, and His Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as if Sin had never been; For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Chriſt could not be called the <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> or <hi>an offering for ſin,</hi> If He were not accepted in Room of the Sinner that comes to Him.</p>
            <p>To clear it a little, There are <hi>Four</hi> thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, in and about this Sacrifice, to make out this, and to prove, That a Sinner, that makes uſe of this Sacrifice, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Pardon of Sin, and Peace with God. The 1. Is the excellency of His Offering. <hi>He offered himſelf,</hi> As it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10.12.14. The Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Himſelf, and of His Bleſſed Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on the Tree, was another ſort of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice then all theſe Bulls, Rams, and Goats, Offered under the Law, that were but Types of Him. The 2. Is the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Perſon, that Offered up this Offering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is in effect the excellency of the Prieſt: As the Sacrifice was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, beyond all other Sacrifices, ſo alſo, is the Prieſt above all other Prieſts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>Such an high Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeperat from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> A Prieſt, who is the Son, and is ſet over the Houſe, as the Heir; and though the Humane Nature was the Sacrifice, yet (as was ſaid before) not as abſtracted from
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:152256:166"/> the Divine Nature, the Perſon being but One, and ſo the Prieſt Offering com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the Sacrifice Offered, and makes, that it cannot but be accepted. The 3d. is, His Willing condeſcending, to be the Sin-offering, to Interpoſe Himſelf, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this Sacrifice, out of reſpect to the Honour of God, that His Juſtice might be Vindicated and Satisfied: And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by acceſs might be made, for ſhewing Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Heirs of Salvation; which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly commends this Sacrifice; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of <hi>John</hi> 10.17. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life, that I might take it again; No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf, and take it again;</hi> It commends His Sacrifice, that He was not conſtrained to it, but did it moſt Willingly, and with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: It's true, if we look to Him, as the Eternal Son of God, and the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the bleſſed Trinity, He could not but be Loved of the Father, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His Incarnation, as after; but that He ſayes, <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me,</hi> It is to be underſtood, an account of His Voluntary condeſcending, as Mediator, to do His Fathers will; and out of reſpect to <hi>His</hi> Honour ingadging, and according to His ingadgement, ſatisfying His Juſtice for the Elect; And this cannot but commend His Offering, That ſuch a glorious Perſon, who was Holy, Harmleſs, and Undefiled, ſhould out of tenderneſs to the Honour of God, and that the wrong done to it by Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, might be repaired; and out of love to the Elect, ſhould condeſcend to ſtoup ſo low, as to make Himſelf a Sin-offering: This regard for the Honour of God, and Willing condeſcendencie to Suffer for the Repairing of it, is abundantly Valuable, and (though it be a great Word) above the diſreſpect that Sinners evidenced to the Honour of God, by their ſinning. The 4th, is the Covenant, which is the ground of this Offering, and that whereby it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, and the Terms of it: It was not an undertaking, as a piece of Will-worſhip, but according to the deliberat Counſel, and Fore-knowledge of God; wherein it was Determined, that the Son ſhould become Cautioner, and be made lyable for the Debt of the Elect, and be an Offering for their Sin, by which Freedom from Sin and Wrath ſhould accreſce to Elect Sinners; and all this being concluded in the Covenant of Redemption, His Offering could not but be accepted for us: The Lord having condeſcended on the Articles of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for this very end.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Doctrine</hi> is of mighty great and notable concernment to Sinners; and were there any ſuch Wakening and Rouring a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mongſt us, that Souls were put to ſay, and cry, <hi>What ſhal we do to be ſaved?</hi> The opening up of the Truth, to wit, That Chriſt is a Sin-offering for Sinners, and that by His Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Atonement is made; would be much more acceptable and refreſhfull; And therefore let this be the 1. <hi>Uſe.</hi> That though there be nothing imaginable, that can be brought before God, which will be acceptable to Him, as a ſatisfaction to His Juſtice; yet here there is a Ranſome found by the Offering whereof to God, a Soul that is lying under challenges for Sin, and apprehenſions of Wrath may expect abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; This is in effect, that which <hi>Elihu</hi> ſayes, <hi>Job</hi> 33. <hi>If there be an interpreter, one of a thouſand to ſhew unto man his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then he is gracious unto him, and ſaith, deliver him from going down to the pit,</hi> I <hi>have found a ranſome;</hi> here is the Ranſome, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſtepping in, in Sinners Room, and Offering Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up a Sacrifice, to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God; So that a Sinner in making uſe of that, may come to be in good terms with God; and are not theſe glad Tydings of great joy, that an Offering is provided, a Ranſome payed, and a way found out, how Sinners lyable to the Curſe may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Freedome, It's no ſmall matter, that God hath given this Subject to us to ſpeak of, and to you to hear of; that the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing Anxiety of a Soul driven almoſt to Diſpair, may have this for an anſwer; even the Blood of Jeſus, <hi>that blood of ſprinkling that purges the conſcience from dead works;</hi> which, as it ſatisfies Juſtice, ſo it quiets the Conſcience of the Sinner, that flies unto it and makes right uſe of it; It would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:152256:167" rendition="simple:additions"/> Sinners well, to think more of theſe Glad Tydings, and to ſtudy to have them alwayes Freſh: There are many Parts of the World, wherein Men are Sacrificing Beaſts; ſome Lambs, ſome Rams, ſome other Beaſts, And ſome, it may be the Firſt-born of their Bodies, for the Sin of their Souls; (and which is lamentable, Sacrificing theſe things to the Devil, on the matter at leaſt, and not to God) and yet all that does not their turn; And not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard of this Offering, they cannot make uſe of it; neither can their Conſcienee ever be quiet: But our Lord Jeſus hath ſent theſe bleſſed News to us, and hath ſhewed us what is the Sin-offering, the Atonement, and Propitiatory Sacrifice; We need not ſend our Children through the fire, nor bring any other Offering to God, to appeaſe His Wrath; He hath given us His Son, and hath accepted Him for a Sin-offering, and hath told us, that this ſhall be as ſufficient and ſatisfying, as if we had made the ſatisfaction our ſelves; here, O! here is the wonder, even a wonder of wonders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 2. See here the way how we come to Life by Chriſt; It's imported in this Doctrine, to be by Chriſt's being made an Offering for us; It's not by our praying to Him, as God, nor by our Holy Living, nor by His working Holineſs in us; (though theſe ought and will be, in ſome meaſure, where He is made uſe of aright) but by His Offering up Himſelf in a Sacrifice for us; and by Gods imputing it to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſidering that Chriſt Jeſus in the Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Room; And that thereby God is pacified, and Sin and Wrath removed; There can no other way be conceived, how we are made partakers of it, but by <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi> This will be the more clear, if we conſider, that the ſame way, that our Sins became Chriſt's, the ſame way His Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe becomes ours; or the ſame way that Juſtice laid Clame to Him for our Debt; the ſame way lay we Claime to His Righteouſneſſe: Now it is Blaſphemous to think, that our Sin became His any other way; but that Legally he entering Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as our Cautioner, our Sin was reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on His Score; even ſo His Righteouſneſs becomes ours, by being imputed to us: So the Apoſtle ſayes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. He was made ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> And have His Righteouſneſſe deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us: It were good that we would learn how to win to this Righteouſneſſe, even by preſenting Him to Juſtice, as Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner for our Debt, and by taking hold of His Righteouſneſſe to ground our plea upon, when we come to reckon with God for our Sins: And we think that there is here a clear ground, for refuting of that way of Juſtification, by any thing inherent in our ſelves: For if it be by His Offering, that we are Juſtified, then it is by nothing in our ſelves. Now this Name that Chriſt's Sufferings get, bears out, that it's that which ſatisfies God, and abſolves us, as the alone Meritorious and Procuring Cauſe; And therefore there is no other thing, that we can derive our Juſtification from, but His Righteouſneſs only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Seing by Chriſt's Offering there is a Ranſome and Atonement to be had; And ſeing it is offered in the Goſpel, we pray you, in the Name of the Lord, take hold of, and improve this Offering; let every Body that hears tell that Chriſt is the <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> endeavour to get Him to be their Sin-offering; There are none that know, and find that they have Sinned, but they would think of an amends; and here it is: and there is ground to exhort you to make uſe of it, and to encourage you in it; becauſe this is the very End of His Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and He is fully furniſhed compleatly to accompliſh it; If there were no acceſs to Life by this Offering, He would not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> in oppoſition to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Offerings; There is ground therefore to declare this to you, that by Chriſt Jeſus Life, and Reconciliation is attainable, and that it is actually attained by accepting of this Offering: Such as accept of it, and reſt upon it, ſhall find Acceptation with God, and Freedome from Sin and Wrath, by vertue thereof; It's a common Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, What ſhall we do? we do all we dow, or may; but if we were ſtudying a long
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:152256:167"/> time to tell you; This is it, even to make uſe of Chriſt's Offering, This, and this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will do your turn compleatly, and no other thing will do it.</p>
            <p>The 4th <hi>Uſe,</hi> Is of ſtrong Conſolation to all who betake themſelves to Chriſt, He is the Sin-offering, that procures the taking away of Sin and Wrath, and that procures Friendſhip with God; and there is no imputation of Sin, nor <hi>condemnation to them who are in him, Rom.</hi> 8.1. And hence is that triumph <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect?</hi> It is God that juſtifieth <hi>who is he that will condemne? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again,</hi> &amp;c. If Juſtice were coming to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the Sentence, what can it ſay to the Believer? Jeſus Chriſt hath ſtepped in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Wrath and Him; and as to Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, He alone is accounted the <hi>Sin-offering;</hi> and as theſe who under the Law Offered the Typical Sacrifices, had acceſs to the Ordinances, and were Sanctified, as to the purifying of the Fleſh: So much more is this Offering able to purifie the Conſcience, and to purge it from dead works; and to give fair acceſs to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Life, and to the Favour of God, to all them who make uſe of it, as if they had never Sinned. I know much of the weight of this Conſolation will lye on this, whether Chriſt's Offering be made uſe of; And ſome will ſay, How ſhall we make uſe of Chriſt's Offering? And others will aſk, how ſhall we know, if we have made right uſe of it? And would to God, that Souls were beatten off from their Pride and Security, and brought under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of a neceſſity of uſe making of Chriſt, He would diſcover both to them: But before we anſwer the Queſtion, there are two things we would preſuppoſe. 1. We preſuppoſe that the Soul is made ſenſible of it's need of Chriſt's Sacrifice, from the apprehenſion it hath of a Quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betwixt God and it, and from the fear of His Wrath becauſe of Sin; elſe the aſking of ſuch a Queſtion is to no purpoſe; For as we hinted before, the Offering of a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice implyes the Confeſſion of Guilt: So the making uſe of Chriſt's Sacrifice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes ſenſe of Sin; Err a Soul can make uſe of His Offering, it muſt know, it's due was utter Conſumption, 2. We preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, That the Soul is deſirous to be at God, and to have peace with Him, To which End Chriſt is the Midſe; and there will be no reſpect had to the Midſe, except there be a reſpect had to the End, as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>He that comes to God, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him diligently;</hi> where there is implyed in the Comer, a deſire to be at God, and an expectation of ſome Benefit, to be had from Him, or as the Word is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. <hi>He is able to ſave to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, all that come to God by him;</hi> Which implyes the Sinners being ſenſible of his loſt condition; his deſire to be at God; and then Chriſt's Offering comes in, as the Mids, to bring about, and to come by that End. But theſe being preſuppoſed, The great thing wherein the Anſwer of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion lyes, How to make uſe of Chriſt's Offering for the attaining of that End, of Pardon of Sin, and Peace with God, ſeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to be holden out in that Word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, them that come unto God by him;</hi> And therein we may conſider Sinners deſire to be at God, and the uſe making of Chriſt, in reference to that End, in theſe Three. 1. To have the Breach made up with God, in reſpect of their State. 2. For quieting the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in reſpect of Particular Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges. 3. For the making up of their defects, in Grace, as well as for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of Sin: And as uſe making of Chriſt in theſe Three, points out the way of a Sinners coming to Chriſt; So a Sinners going on in this way, evidenceth his right uſe making of Him; which will ſerve to Anſwer both the Queſtions, to wit, how to make uſe of Chriſt's Offering? and how to know that we are making uſe of it a right?</p>
            <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> to wit, Going to God by Chriſt. 1. It is oppoſed to ſtepping in to God, at the firſt hand. 2. It is oppoſed to the uſe making of any other thing in our coming to God, for making up the Breach. 3. It implyes the Sinners betaking of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:152256:168"/> to Chriſt, as the <hi>Mid-man,</hi> by whom he expects to come to Friendſhip with God; There are ſome Scriptural Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, whereof, if we could rightly conceive, and apply them to this Purpoſe, they might ſerve much to clear it: There is a Diſtance, which, like a Gulf is fixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Man, a Soul then comes to God by Chriſt, as one goes over a Gulf by a Bridge; Hinted at by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. <hi>Having therefore boldneſs to enter into the holieſt, by the blood of Jeſus, by a new and living way, which he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to us through the vail, which is his fleſh,</hi> We take the force of the Similitude to lye in this, That as one that hath a Vail betwixt him and another, whom he deſires to approach to; muſt go through the Vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere he win to that other; So here Chriſt's Fleſh being the Vail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He, by His Death hath rent it; that Sinners might ſtep through that Rent, or Breach to God; That is, when all was before ſhut up, and cloſs betwixt God and Sinners; Chriſt was content, that a Rent ſhould be made in His Body, through which they might come to God; Coming to God by Chriſt in this Senſe, is to walk, as 't were, on Chriſt's Sufferings as a Bridge, and to have no other Place, or Ground to Stand, or Walk on to God, but this: Again, <hi>John</hi> 10. Chriſt calls Himſelf the <hi>Door, I am the door,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 14. To the ſame purpoſe, He is called the <hi>way:</hi> To tell us, That, as none can come in to a Houſe, but by the Door, nor can come to the end of their journey, but by the way that leads to it; So Heaven being ſhut up, and cloſed upon Sinners, any that would have entry into it, muſt betake themſelves to Chriſt by Faith; For by Faith in Him, the Door is opened, and the Way Paved to Heaven; It is a good token, when the way to Heaven looks on the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as a hard Wall, or like a ſinking Moſs or Boge; and Faith in Chriſt, gives him ſome little hold, whereby he wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That <hi>he counts all things to be but loſſe and dung, for the excellencie of the knowledge of Chriſt, that he may be found in him, not having his own righteouſneſs, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ:</hi> When he, even he thinks on the Day of Judgement, and where he will hide himſelf in that Day, when it ſhal be aſked, (and every other ſhall be aſked the Queſtion) Where art thou? his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and Reſolution is, to give this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; I am in Chriſt, Lord; I have no righteouſneſs of my own to lippen, or to truſt to; I will never make mention of my pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in my Miniſtry, of the tenderneſſe of my Walk, nor of any thing elſe of that Kind; But I will betake my ſelf to Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and will ſay, Lord, here is much Debt on my Score; but there is a Righteouſneſſe to which I am fled by Faith; And on this I will ground all my Anſwers: This Righteouſneſſe is in Chriſt, as the Purchaſer thereof; And it is ours by Faith, when we betake our ſelves to it, to make it the ground of our Claime; even as if a number of Men were Purſued for Debt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Judge, and one ſhould come in, and ſay; I have payed ſo much; And another ſhould ſay, give me down a Part, and I will pay the reſt; And a Third ſhould ſay, give me a Day and Time, and I will Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; And a Fourth poor Body ſhould come in, and ſay, I have indeed nothing my ſelf to pay m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The 2d. thing, wherein the exerciſe of Faith, in the uſe making of Chriſt's Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice conſiſts; is, in reference to particular Challenges; For even when a Soul hath fled to Chriſt, and made uſe of His Sacrifice for Pardon of Sin, and for Peace with God; it will not be free from Challenges, and from new Accompts; And therefore the exerciſe of Faith is to be continued in the uſe making of this Offering, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to theſe particulars, as well as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the making of our Peace with God at firſt: In which reſpect, Faith is called a <hi>Shield, Eph.</hi> 6.16. When new Guilt is contracted, and drawn on, and when Tentation ſayes to the Believer, Is this the Goodneſſe of your Purpoſes, and Reſolutions, which have been like Flaxe before the Fire? No ſooner was thou Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed, and Aſſaulted, but thou didſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Succumb; and waſt much Foiled, and Prevailed over: The Soul runs to the ſame Targe, Buckler, or Shield; and though every one of theſe Challenges, be like a fiery Dart, that would ſet the Conſcience on a Flame; yet by Faith the Dart is kept off, or the Venome of it Suckt ſo out, that it burns not, and it makes the Soul to ſay, though I cannot ſatisfie for the Debt, yet there is in Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe whereto I betake my ſelf, which can do it; And if we look to that, which intertains Tormenting Exerciſes, that ſpeak evil of the Grace of God (for humbling Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes are called for, and are Profitable) we will find it to be this; to wit, When Souls come to Diſpute, and Debate with Challenges, and do not Interpoſe the Targe or Shield of Faith, taking hold of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, betwixt them and theſe Challenges; for ſometimes a Soul will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it ſelf to Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe for Peace at firſt, and will look upon it ſelf, as bound to keep, and maintain it's own Peace; and yet will, on the matter, think that it's but a ſort of B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ffilling, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning of Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe, (to ſay ſo) to be making dayly uſe of it, for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of new Challenges; And ſuch will be ready to ſay, ſhould not a Believer be Holy? And we ſay, that he ſhould, and that it were to abuſe the Spiritual Armour, to take one Piece of it, and not another, yea, or not all the reſt; but this we ſay, likewiſe, that when one makes uſe of the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> he may warrantably make uſe of <hi>the Shield of Faith alſo;</hi> Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in this, that is, when Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is not made uſe of, in reference to particular Challenges, mightily indiſpoſeth many ſerious poor Souls, for uſe making of the reſt of the Weapons of their Spiritual Warefare; And therefore, as ye would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Faith in general, for reconciiling you to God, as to your State, ſo ye would exerciſe Faith on Chriſt's Offering for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of particular Quarrells; and for ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing of particular Challenges; which is to be dayly waſhing at the Fountain. In ſhort, as to the other Queſtion, This may be a mark of a Perſon, that is making right uſe of Chriſt's Offering for his Peace, if he be dayly making uſe of Chriſt's Offering for his Peace, if he be dayly making uſe of His Offering, for quenching and ſilencing of particular Challenges.</p>
            <p>The 3d. Thing, wherein this exerciſe of Faith: in the uſe making of Chriſt's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice conſiſts, is, in reference to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of our Grace; we have indeed much need of Chriſt, and He hath much forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming in Him, for the helping of Grace; for the amending of weak Faith, and Love, and other Graces; as well as for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Pardon of Sin, and of Peace with God; and for anſwering of Challenges; And yet oftimes, theſe who are making uſe of Chriſt in the former two reſpects, are
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:152256:169"/> in hazard, and ready to think, that they ſhould Believe more, Love more, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe other Graces more, of themſelves; But we are to make uſe of Him, for help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defects of Grace, as well as for theſe other things; By this, I mean not only the uſe making of Chriſt meritoriouſly; and ſo that we ſhould look on Faith, Love, Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and every other Grace, as purchaſed by Him, as well as Peace with God; and and that we ſhould make uſe of Chriſt's Offering, for attaining of theſe; But I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo mean, that we ſhould make uſe of Chriſt, as a Prieſt, to make His own Offering effectual, for attaining all the Benefits of His Purchaſe: Conſidering, <hi>that he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all theſe that come unto God by him:</hi> The Apoſtle goeth on this ground, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. <hi>Seing we have ſuch an high Prieſt,</hi> and ſuch an Offering, <hi>Let us draw near with full aſſurance of faith,</hi> &amp;c. And if ye aſk what this is? It is of largely extended uſe; It is even to make uſe of Chriſt, as a Prieſt, not only as the object of Faith, and as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer and Worker of Faith, but alſo for the confirming of weak Faith; It's a looking to Him, to get the weak Faith, that we dare ſcarcely lippen to, made ſtrong, and a lippening, or truſting of our weak Faith to Him, to carry us through, when we dare not well lean to it; In the firſt reſpect, we do by Faith lippen, and truſt to Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe: in this laſt reſpect, we lippen, or truſt our Faith to Him; And look to Him, not only for Pardon, but we lippen to Him for making Faith, to keep it's grips of Him; and as it was with that poor man ſpoken of, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. Who, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the one ſide, betakes himſelf to Chriſt, <hi>If thou canſt do any thing, have compaſſion on us, and help us:</hi> And on the other ſide, being holily impatient, finding his Faith like to fail and miſgive, when Chriſt ſayes to him, <hi>If thou canſt believe; all things are poſſible to him that believes;</hi> he cryes out, in that his holy impatiencie, <hi>Lord, I believe help thou my unbelief:</hi> he acknowledges his unbelief, as well as his Faith; and truſts Chriſt with the mending of his Faith, and holding together the Sheards of it (ſo to ſpeak,) when it was like to crack, and fall aſunder: Our doing thus, evidenceth a more full denying of our ſelves, when we dare not truſt our own believing, but as it is committed to Chriſt, and when there is a Crediting of Him, and Leaning to Him, both for the Benefit we expect, and for the Application of it; That Word of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. Is appoſit, and excellent to this purpoſe; <hi>That I may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that for which I am apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> As is alſo that of <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 Epiſt- 1 <hi>Chap. v.</hi> 10. <hi>Who are keeped through faith by the power of God.</hi> So then in anſwer to both the Queſtions. 1. How to make uſe of Chriſt's Sacrifice? And 2. How to know, if we have made, or do make uſe of it a right? We ſay in ſhort, as to the <hi>First,</hi> That there muſt <hi>Firſt</hi> be a Leaning to His Merit, for the Buying, or Procuring of our Peace, and a betaking of our ſelves to it for that end. 2. When Tentations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and when new Challenges ariſe, there muſt be a conſtant dayly betaking of our ſelves to Faith, in his Sacrifice, as to a Shield, or as to a Store-houſe; which He Himſelf calleth <hi>an abyding in him, John</hi> 15.3. There muſt be an uſe making of Chriſt, as a Prieſt, not only to remove dayly Contracted Guiltineſſe, but alſo to heall the Infirmity and Weakneſſe of our Graces; eſpecially of Faith and Love; giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Him Credit to bring our Faith and Love to perfection; It is a ſweet Word, which we have, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>He healeth all thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</hi> As to the 2d: Queſtion, we ſay, that Perſon may look on himſelf, as mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right uſe of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, that is, dayly making uſe of Him, in theſe fore-named Reſpects, who, if he were to appear before God, it is Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe only that he would build on; He is alſo dayly making uſe of Him, to anſwer Challenges as they recurre; and dare not lippen to his own Faith, but as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Him; Conſidering, that as Faith is in Himſelf, it is dayly in hazard to be extinguiſhed; And we may add, that he ſo makes uſe of Chriſt; as that he dare not go to God without Him; as the Word is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Them that come to God by him;</hi>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:152256:169"/> he comes unto God by Chriſt, in Prayer, in Praiſes, and in every other Dutie of Worſhip: The Apoſtle, to this Purpoſe, ſayes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. <hi>By him therefore, let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God.</hi> The believing Soul is never right till it's <hi>all</hi> be put in His hand: Though all theſe be not diſtinct, and explicit in the Perſons uſe making of Chriſt's Sacrifice; yet he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, that the Application of the Benefits which Chriſt hath purchaſed to him, ſhal be made forthcoming to him, by vertue of that ſame Purchaſe; And that He who is the <hi>Author,</hi> will alſo be, <hi>the finiſher of his faith:</hi> The ſum and upſhot of all, is, to ſhew that as we have much Good, by and in Chriſt, if we could make uſe of it; So He calleth us to be Cheerfull, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, in the uſe making of it, and not to Miniſh our own Conſolation, when he hath condeſcended Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly thus to Extend, and Inlarge it, with ſo Richly Liberal, and Bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a Hand.</p>

            <p>IT may be thought, and that very juſtly, that there muſt be ſome great and glorious Deſign driven in the contryvance of the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; That was executed by ſuch a Mean, as is the Suffering of the Son of God; And that there muſt be ſome Noble and Notable thing following on it, that moved the Father to ſend his Son, and the Son to come for this Work. This part of the Text anſwers, and tells us, what is the Deſign, <hi>He ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his dayes,</hi> &amp;c. He ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat Life to many that were Dead, and ſhall beget a Generation, that ſhall have Life deryved from Him, as a Seed have from their Parents: And ſo this is a third Anſwer, for removing of that ſtumbling Objection, propoſed in the beginning of the Verſe; to wit, How it came to paſſe, that the Innocent Son of God, <hi>who had done no violence, and who had no guile in his mouth,</hi> was put to ſuch Sufferings? We ſhew that there were three Grounds laid down, in Anſwer to this. 1. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him,</hi> It was the Fathers good pleaſure. The 2d. is, from the Nature of His Sufferings, which were to be a <hi>Sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or <hi>an Offering for Sin,</hi> not for His own, but for the Sins of the Elect. The 3d. Is, That His Sufferings ſhould have notable Fruits, and Effects following them, ſet down in Three Expreſſions; which are partly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies; telling, what ſhould be the Effects of the Sufferings of the Mediator; partly Promiſes made to the Mediator; telling what ſhould be His Reward and Hyre (to ſpeak ſo) for His Sufferings. 1. <hi>He ſhall ſee his ſeed;</hi> that is, many ſhall get good of His Sufferings; 2. <hi>He ſhall prolong his
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:152256:170"/> dayes,</hi> That is, He ſhall outlive theſe His Troubles and Sufferings, and ſhall have a glorious Out-gate, and Reign. 3. <hi>The pleaſure of the Lord ſhal proſper in his hand.</hi> That is, The Work that was given Him to do, and to finiſh ſhall thrive well; and no part of it ſhall faill, or miſcarry. In the Firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to Him, or in the firſt Effect that ſhould follow on His Sufferings, in theſe Words, <hi>He ſhall ſee his ſeed;</hi> We have theſe Three. 1. A Relation implyed betwixt Chriſt and Believers; They are His <hi>ſeed;</hi> ſuch as in the next verſe, are ſaid to be <hi>juſtifiea</hi> by Him; It is in ſhort, many ſhall get Pardon of Sin, and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by His Death; In this reſpect, it's ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. penult verſe, <hi>In ſtead of thy fathers, ſhall be thy children, whom thou mayeſt make princes in all the earth.</hi> 2. A Propheſie, and foretelling of the event, that ſhould follow Chriſt's Sufferings, and ſo it holds out this; That our Lord Jeſus ſhould not only have a Seed, but a numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Seed, that ſhould be made ſure to Him, And it ſeems to be in alluſion to that which is ſpoken of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of others in the Old Teſtament, of whom it's ſaid, that <hi>they ſhould have Seed;</hi> That is, that many ſhould deſcend of them; But there is more here; For, whereas others, while they are Living, or in their Life-time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a Seed, which begetting, is interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Death; The Death of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus begets His Seed, or His Seed are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by His Death. 3. Conſidering the Words as a Promiſe, they hold out this, That though our Lord Jeſus Suffer, and Die, yet He ſha l not only have a Seed, but He ſhall ſee His Seed. He ſhall outlive His Sufferings, and Death; And ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted In ſeeing of them, who ſhall get the good of His Sufferings; As it's ſaid of <hi>Job,</hi> that <hi>he ſaw his children, or ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny that came of him; even ſo though our Lord came to Death, and to the G ave; yet He ſhould not only have a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Seed, many Children, but He ſhould live, and ſee them; and that not only for three, or four, or for ten Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; But for very many Generations: And His dying, ſhould neither mar His be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting, nor the ſeeing of them: And this <hi>ſeeing of his Seed,</hi> is oppoſed to ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents as are Dead; and who, though their Children, and Poſterity be in want, yet they know it not. From the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe, <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That Believers are our Lord Jeſus His Seed; they are come of Him; whatever their Meanneſſe and Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be, in the World; and though they could not clame Kindred to any of external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honeſt Rank and Quality; yet they are His Seed: To this purpoſe, the Apoſtle beſpeaks the believing <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28. <hi>Ye ſee your calling brethren, how that not many mighty, not many wiſe men, after the fleſh, not many noble are called; but God hath choſen the fooliſh things of this world, to confound the wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that no fleſh ſhould glorie in his preſence:</hi> Though ye be not of any high Rank or Quality in the World; yet <hi>of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who of God is made to us, wiſdom, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ſanctification and redemption: In this</hi> reſpect Chriſt is called the <hi>everlaſting father, Iſa:</hi> 9.6. For He is the Father of all Believers; that ever had, or ſhall have Life; who are, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. penult verſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, His <hi>Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To clear this a little, ye ſhall take it in theſe Four or Five reſpects, or Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, in which believers are ſaid to be <hi>Chriſts Seed,</hi> or be deſcended of Him. 1. In this reſpect, that as Believers they have their being of Him, as Children deſcended from off their Parents, as to their Natural be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; So Believers, as they have a Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall Being, deſcend from Him; and hold their Being of Him; without whom they had never been Believers: And in this reſpect they are His Seed. 1. Becauſe He <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly</hi> Purchaſed Life to them; which is the thing here mainly underſtood; as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing immediatly an the back of His Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. 2. Becauſe they have Life from Him <hi>efficiently,</hi> as He works it in them, and by the Goſpel begets them; Therefore He is ſaid 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. <hi>To have brought life and immortality to light, through the goſpel,</hi> which was not known in many parts of the World, till Chriſt brought it forth;
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:152256:170"/> In this reſpect, Believers are Chriſt's Seed; we are not born Believers of our Parents, nor have the Faith which we have, of the Ordinances, nor of Miniſters, as efficient Cauſes thereof; But it is from our Lord Jeſus, who is Believers <hi>Father,</hi> Thus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have an Affinity, and near Relation to Chriſt, even to be His Children: And any that would lay claim to Faith, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life, would ſee well, that it be this way kindly, and (as we uſe to ſay) leill come, from Jeſus Chriſt, and that they be in His Debt, and Common for it. 2ly, They are His <hi>Seed,</hi> in reſpect of the likeneſs that is betwixt Him and them, or in reſpect of the Qualifications that are in them; as they are ſaid, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>By the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great and precious promiſes, to be made partakers of the divine nature;</hi> They have of the ſame Spirit, for the kind that He, as Mediator, hath in Him; And it's in this reſpect, that <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.1. The Believer is called the <hi>Princeſs daughter,</hi> which eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looks to the Spiritual Generous, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Qualifications, that are deryved from Chriſt, to the Believer; Hence, Believers are ſaid to have the <hi>Spirit of Sons,</hi> when all others, though they be the greateſt in the World; have but the Spirit of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and their Generoſity, is nothing to that of Believers; who are <hi>made partakers of the divine nature;</hi> We have not, ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>received the ſpirit of fear, but of faith and love, and of a ſound mind;</hi> Ah! there are many that claime Kindred and Relation to Chriſt, that are very unlike Him. 3ly. They are called Chriſt's <hi>Seed,</hi> in reſpect of the care that <hi>He</hi> hath of them. Never Mother was more tender of the Sucking Child, then He is of His Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children; Therefore, ſayeth the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15. <hi>A mother may forget her ſucking child; but I will not forget thee:</hi> Hence, is that Phraſe, even as to viſible Profeſſors in the Church, who refuſe to liſten to the call of the Goſpel; which is much more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently verified in Believers; <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>How often would I have gathered thee as a hen doth her chickens under her wings?</hi> So tender and reſpective is He to His Children; as the Mother is, tender to the Sucking Child, or as the Hen is of her newly hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and young Chickens; for they are, in ſome reſpect, come out of His own Bowels; His Blood was ſhed to Purchaſe them; So it is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. <hi>He gathered the lambs with his arm, he carries them in his boſome, And gently leads thoſe that are with young.</hi> And, O! what Maſſie Conſolation have ſuch Words as theſe, in them; And what confidence may Believing Sinners have to come to this Mediator; That is a Mother, a Father, a Brother, and a Parent, that hath begotten us out of His own Bowels; and in ſome reſpect, (as we are Believers) hath as a Mother conceived us in His own Womb. 4ly.

               <hi>Uſe,</hi> As all Relations betwixt Chriſt and Bellevers, ſpeak out much Conſolation; So doth this, if we were in Caſe to apply it; This one Word hath in it, and holds forth a good Condition, and is a very broad Chartour.</p>
            <p>See here then. 1. What we are in Chriſt's Common and Debt, who are Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; It's much to be made a Friend, to be fred from the Curſe of God, and to have all our Debt payed; But this is more to be His <hi>Seed,</hi> to be His own Children; to have our Life of Him, to have our Proviſion and Portion from Him; It's really a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that we wonder not more at this, and other Relations, that are betwixt Him and Believers; as namely, he is the Believers <hi>Father,</hi> and takes them to be <hi>His Sons and Daughters;</hi> He is the Believers <hi>Brother,</hi> and <hi>is not aſhamed to call them bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi> He is the Believers <hi>Husband,</hi> and they are His <hi>Spouſe;</hi> He is their <hi>Bridegrome,</hi> and they are <hi>His Bride;</hi> Such Relations as theſe are pitched upon, and made choiſe of, to fill (If I may ſpeak ſo) the Faith of the Believer, and that the Believer may feed ſweetly and delicately on them, till the time come that the Vail of Similitudes betak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away; and they be brought to ſee Him as He is, even Face to Face; and that thereby they may be helped to win to read their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and priviledges, which they have in Him: What can be the reaſon then that ſo few think, and eſteem ſuitably of the Excellent, and Deſirable Condition of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and that words of this kind reliſh not? Here is the Reaſon, He of whom they hold all theſe Priviledges, and by whom they are put into this Notable, and Non-ſuch Condition, is not ſuitably Eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, and accounted Precious; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Believers in Him, are thought the leſs of. Our hearts ſhould melt in love to Him, and in ſorrow for offending Him, at the Reading and Hearing of ſuch expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, wherewith the Scriptures of God are ſtuffed full.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, Are there any that would have a Good and Happy Condition ſummed up, and compended; Here it is; even to have our Lord Jeſus to be a Father; and to be His Seed; to come in as Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Him: I appeal to you all, if any Condition can be put in the Ballance with this; Is there any Honour and Dignity like it, or comparable with it? Who can claim to be come of ſuch a Parent as is He, <hi>who is King of kings, and Lord of lords, the Prince of the kings of the earth;</hi> The Father of Glory, His eldeſt and only begotten Son, by an Eternal and unſpeakable Generation, who, in all things hath the preheminency; What is your Pedegrie, who will ſay, and boaſt, that ye are of ſuch a Laird's or Lord's Houſe, and of ſuch an Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and Stock; yea, though ye were of Blood Royal, what is it to this? what will become of Mens Gentility or Nobility of Birth, yea, of Royalty of Birth, in that Day, when Chriſt ſhall ſet His Throne in the Clouds? To have this Relation to Chriſt, will be more Valuable, and Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable in that Day, then to have been great Commanders, Lairds, Lords, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes Dukes, Princes, and King's; who will all in that Day ſtand upon the ſame Level, with the Pooreſt Peaſants, and

            <p>There are two or three <hi>Marks,</hi> which we may gather from the Words, that may help to ſhew, when this Claim is warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably made, and which may evidence the groundleſſneſs of the Claim of many.

How many dream of a Right to Chriſt; who know no other Birth or Being, but that which is Natural? 2.

A natively and Genuinly diſpoſed Child, acknowledgeth his Father,

               <hi>As</hi> his Father, and reverenceth, and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Father <hi>as</hi> his Father, But there are many that pretend to a Being from Chriſt, who think not themſelves in His Debt, and Common for it, and, who know not what is is to walk under the Conviction of their Obligation to Chriſt, for their ſuppoſed ſpiritual Life and Being. 3. They who are Chriſt's <hi>Seed,</hi> have in them a likeneſs to Him, as they did once <hi>bear the image of the earthly;</hi> ſo <hi>now they bear the image of the heavenly Adam:</hi> Not that they come up in all things to be exactly like to the Pattern, but it is their aim, and other things that diſconform them to Him are deformed, loathſome, and ugly in their ſight; Their old Inclination is burdenſome to them; And is the continual ground of an inward Conteſt and Wreſtling; and in a manner, they are troubled at the very heart, how to keep down what is oppoſit to Chriſt; And when their Corruption Over-maſters them, they are the more diſcompoſed, and diſquieted; They diſcern ſomething in them, that is not like to Chriſt, and they abhor that, though it be never ſo near and dear to them, their very <hi>Self;</hi> they ſee ſomething alſo like to Chriſt in them; And they Cheriſh, and make much of it; they would fain be at more of it, and to have His Image more deeply impreſſed on their Spirits, which they reckon their greateſt, yea, their only Beauty.</p>
            <p>The 3. <hi>Uſe,</hi> is for Direction to Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; if ye be <hi>Chriſt's Seed,</hi> ye muſt be other ſort of Folks in your Deſigns, and in your Deportment and carriage; King's Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ought not to carrie as others; It would be highly unſuitable; yea, even abomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſee them walk ſo trivially, and lightly as every Baſe, Ill-bred Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Child doth; It's no leſs Incongruous, and Unbecoming, that Believers ſhould be taken with this and that Vanity, that meer Worldlings are taken with, and hunt after.</p>
            <p>The 4th <hi>Uſe,</hi> Speaks a Word of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to Believers; And holds forth the greatneſs of the Priviledge of being <hi>Christ's Seed;</hi> It will be much to perſwade a Poor Sinner, duely ſenſible of Sin, to believe this; And that the Lord is in earneſt, when He ſpeaks thus; That ſuch an one, who hath betaken Himſelf to Chriſt for Life, and humbly Claims Right to nothing, but by Verture of Chriſt's Right (the main thing, that our Union with Him is bottomed upon) who is content to be in Chriſt's Common for Life, and goes not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to eſtabliſh his own Righteouſneſſe, but leans to His Righteouſneſſe, for Life, and Salvation, ſhould be <hi>His Seed,</hi> and have all the Priviledges of Sons derived to Him; And yet it is the Lord's faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Word; Neither hath Eye ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor hath it entered into the Heart of Man to conceive, what good things are laid up for ſuch a Perſon; and that are ſtuffed up in theſe Expreſſions of our Relation to Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 5. It may be alſo a quieting and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting Word to ſome Believers, who are in Affliction, Poverty, and Straits in the World; That our Lord Jeſus is a Kindly Affectionat Parent; more kindly and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hearted, then the tendereſt Father or Mother; and indeed it may ſufficiently quiet them, that they have ſuch a kindly Overſeer, and Proviſor, who is alſo a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Sympathizer with them, what ever their Condition be, He will not deny His Off-ſpring, and Seed, whom He laid down His Life to Purchaſe.</p>
            <p>The 6th <hi>Uſe.</hi> May be for Incitement and Provocation to all that would be Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, to place it here; Intereſt in Chriſt Jeſus, by Believing on Him, brings us to have Intereſt in the enjoying of Him, and all that is His; and can there be any more ſought after, or wiſhed for? Are there any, but would think it a good Life, to be here? And who are they, of whom He ſpeaks ſo? It is not of ſome ſort of ſtrange and uncouth Folk, that were once in the World, but are now all out of it; And of whom there are none now in it; It is not ſuch as want Sin, and derive their Life from their own Works; but it is ſuch as are, 1. As conſidered in themſelves dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes, and without Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Life and Being; And who know that all the pains that they can take, will not
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:152256:172" rendition="simple:additions"/> acquire it; And who it may be, are quite Dead to their own apprehenſion and ſenſe oftentimes; And who have Judged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and have the Sentence of Death in themſelves. 2. It's ſuch as look to Him for the obtaining of Life, and who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Him for any Life, or Livelineſſe they have; And who expect it, and bruike it, by vertue of His Purchaſe; which is that on which all their Plea, for Life is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Now I know, that all this will not readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clear ſome; There are ſo many things that look counterfit like; But I am now ſpeaking to them, who have ſome ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Spiritual Life, which yet are not ſo Lively, as they, can diſcern them to be the Stirrings and Sticklings of Life; And they have a Body of Death in them, which is ready to extinguiſh that Life; and often they think it is extinguiſhed already; They have Convictions of their own Deadneſs, and that things are wrong in their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are quite out of all Hopes of Righteouſneſs, from and by themſelves, or from any thing that they have done, or can do; And they have ſome confuſed looks to Chriſt; but they cannot Rid their Feet in the Matter of their Faith; and Duties go not ſo with them as they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and would have them.

               </gap>, whence comes that Stickling of Life or Feeling of that Bodie of Death? What is the Original of it? will Nature diſcover the Corruption of Nature, and bring Folks to be out of Love with Corrupt Nature? Certainly, where this is, it's not like Nature, but is the Life of Chriſt; eſpecially, when it puts Folks to diſcern, and take up their own Deadneſſe; to quit their own Righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to be content to lay their Mouth in the Duſt and to betake themſelves to the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, if they could win to be diſtinct in it; This looks to be from Chriſt, whoſe <hi>Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces the World of ſin,</hi> and of the ſin of <hi>unbelief</hi> in particular; And of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> as being only to be had in Chriſt; and of <hi>judgement,</hi> that is, of the reaſonableneſſe, that He ſhould have a Dominion over them, and that they ſhould walk in Holineſſe: Yet, notwithſtanding of all this, they are hanging in a kind of Suſpence and hover; and know not whether to look on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as Believers or not; They wot well that it is not right with them; that they are loſt in themſelves, and that no other way will do their turn, but Faith in the Righteouſneſſe of a Mediator: The thing whereat they Stick and halt, is, that they know not how to through, and maintain the conſent that they have given; and they cannot think, that their Faith is true Faith, becauſe they know not how to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low forth the exerciſe of it; though they have renunced their own Righteouſneſſe, And laid their Reckoning, to be in Chriſt's Debt and Common, for Righte uſneſſe and Life; if ever they come by them; All their difficulty, is, how to through their Believing. Now it is not to the founding of Life, that we are here ſpeaking, but to the exerciſe of Life, and to the finding out of Life; And we ſay, that ſuch an exerciſe ſuppons Life to be, though it be not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable in it's exerciſe, to the Soul it ſelf; There are many Poor Creatures born and brought forth into the World, that can neither Talk nor Walk, but muſt be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and keeped Tenderly, and that are ſome way, as if they were not brought out of the Womb: So is it with many Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and it were good to be in Chriſt's Common, as for Life, ſo for bringing Life to exerciſe, and by diligence and waiting on Him, in the uſe of His own appointed Means, to ſeek to come to ſome Diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Neating, and Exerciſing of any Life, that He hath given; And it is no ſmall incouragement to this; That Chriſt <hi>ſhall ſee his ſeed,</hi> That He muſt have Saints and Believers in Him; which ſhould make Poor Souls, that have no Life in themſelves, with the more confidence to commit themſelves to Him, upon this very ground, that the Father hath ingadged to Chriſt, that He ſhall have many ſuch for His <hi>Seed;</hi> The which Promiſe is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Him, in the gathering in of Poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and Mind-perplexed Sinners, to be in His Debt, for Life, and to hold their
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:152256:173"/> Life of Him for ever; It will ſure be no ſmall part of the ground of Saints praiſe in Heaven, that He not only bought Life for them, but that He made Application of Life to them; And trained them on, till He got them fitted to ſpeak to His Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iſe; Wherein the Body of Death makes many a ſad ſtop, and makes poor Believers to Stammer, as it were, while they are here. But it's good News that Jeſus Chriſt hath bought Life, and brought it to Light; And that by this Goſpel, He is making Application of it, and declaring that He is content to beſtow it freely, on all them that will be in His Common for it.</p>

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:152256:173"/> and their great Obligation to Chriſt on that account; they are oblidged to Him, for their Spiritual Life and Beeing; as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are oblidged to their Natural Parents, for their Natural Life and Beeing; And Infinitely more oblidged, in as much, as the one Life is Infinitly Preferable to the other.</p>
            <p>There are three things more to be <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,</hi> from the Words, And 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering them as they ſtand in Dependence on the Former; That God's Deſign, in ſending His Son into the World, and the Mediators D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h ſhall certainly procure Life to many; Or thus, it cannot be, but His Death muſt have tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, to the ſaving of Souls from Death, and to the making of them partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Life. 3. Looking on the Words, as a Promiſe made to the Mediator; We <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> from them, That the Seeing of a Seed, is exceeding much thought of, by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; It pleaſed Him wondrous will; Therefore this Promiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of a Seed is m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m to lay down His Life.</p>
            <p>We ſhall ſpeak a Word to each of theſe; And ſhall leave the conſideration of the Words, as they hold out, not only our Lord's out-living his Sufferings, but His ſeeing a Seed on the back of them, to the Second Effect that follows; <hi>He ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Firſt <hi>Doctrine,</hi> we ſuppoſe, It will be clear, if we conſider how the <hi>ſeing of his ſeed</hi> is Subjoyned to, and Dependeth upon the former Words, anent His making <hi>His ſoul an offering for ſin</hi> which holds out this, That the great Deſign of God, and of Chriſt the Mediator its His Sufferings, is, to beget a People to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ternal Life, And to make way, that Sinners Naturall D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life, and may be begotten to the Hope of Eternal Life, through Him: And what other Deſign, I pray, could there be then this? For the Lord had nothing to procure to Himſelf; To ſpeak ſimply, there could be no addition made to the Glory of God thereby; Therefore, it's ſaid <hi>John</hi> 6.39, 40. <hi>This is the Fathers will that hath ſent me, that of all that be hath given me, I ſhould loſs nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up at the laſt day: And this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one who ſeeth the Son,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth <hi>on him may have everlasting life; and I will raiſe him up at the last day.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation;</hi> and what is it? <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> and that <hi>John</hi> 10.10. <hi>I came that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two things that we would ſpeak a Word to, for clearing of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> And then make Uſe of it. The 1. is, How this can be God's Deſign in Chriſt's Humiliation, to beget many Sons to Life? 2. How Chriſt's Death Contributs to this Deſign? For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> When we ſpeak of God's Deſign h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re, we mean not His laſt and ultimat Deſign, but His immediat Deſign in the Goſpel, which is ſubſervient to that His laſt and ultimat Deſign; to wit, The Glorif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing of His Grace and Juſtice, in giving the Mediator, to Satisfie Juſtice for Dyvour Sinners, who are not able to Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for themſelves; and He having choſen this, as the Midſt, to that higheſt end, we may well ſay, that this is His immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at Deſign in the Goſpel; that thereby the Glory of His Grace and Juſtice might be manifeſted. For the 2d. Which is, How Chriſt's Sufferings contribute to this end? It may be ſoon cleared, if we conſider, that there is a twofold Let in the way of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, partaking of Life, which Chriſt's Suff rings do remove. The 1. Let, is a ſtand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng Quarrel, betwixt God and the Elect, they having Sinned, and having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to pay their Debt; This our Lord Jeſus, by His Death removes; He payes the Debt, and tears the Obligation, called, <hi>the hand writing that was againſt them,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:152256:174"/> nailling it to his Croſs,</hi> Col. 2. And in this reſpect, His Death is called <hi>a ranſome for many;</hi> And in the Words before, He is <hi>ſaid to have made his Soul an offering for ſin,</hi> On the ſame account; to wit, That the Principal Deb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or might be ſet free. The 2d. Let, is Mans utter unfitneſſe to walk with God: For though the Debt were taken away, yet they have no Life; But Jeſus Chriſt, by His Death, hath laid down a ground, how a Sinner may be reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, and may partake of Grace here; And ſo be in caſe to walk with God, even while ſojourning in the World, in ſome good meaſure; and of the Life of Glory hereafter; His Sufferings are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Ranſome for their Debt; but alſo a Bridge (to ſpeak ſo) to ſtep over the Gulf of the diſtance th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

See here, Believers, what ye are in the Fathers Debt, for ſending His Son; And what ye are in the Sons Debt, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to die for you; Ye behoved to have born the Curſe your ſelves, if He had not born it, but He took it on H mſelf, that ye might be Freed from it; Thus it ſtood with you, ye deſerved to be ſhut out for ever from God, to have the Sword of His Juſtice awakened againſt you: And <hi>he gave his back to the ſmitters, and his cheecks to them that plucked of the haire;</hi> And was content that the Sword of Juſtice ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake againſt Him, and ſmite Him, that He might, by His ſtrips heal them, and by His Death, procure Life to them; Yea, it ſtood thus with you, and it could not be otherwayes; The Juſtice of God being provocked, and the Elect being under the Curſe, as it is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one, that continueth not in all things written in the Law to do them: Ezek.</hi> 18.4. <hi>The ſoul that ſins ſhall die.</hi> Either they behov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to die, or the Cautioner; and our Lord was content to be a <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſet Sinners free: <hi>To be lifted up on the croſs, that he might draw all men after him,</hi> to pay their D bt, which all the Creatures could never have payed: And therefore, we would aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vers well, to be often reckoning, what they are in His Debt. It's an of God's great Ends in the Work of Redemption, even to have Sinners eſteeming highly of, and much Raviſhed with His Grace, and with His Love, brightly ſhinning in the way thereof; yet leſs Conſcience is made of this, then of many other Duties, by Believers; We will ſend an Ear to a Practical Point of Doctrine, and will ſome way ayme to mind it; If we be bidden pray, we will
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:152256:174"/> pray; if we be commanded to Mortifie Sin, we will endeavour it, and ſo in other Duties: But who minds this as a Dutie, when we are called of God, to Admire, and Praiſe His Grace, and Love, and Humbly to Glory in Him, ſo, as ſeriouſly to ſet our ſelves to fall about it? And yet this were a moſt Native, Proper, and Kindly Exerciſe for Believers; even like the Work of thoſe, who ſay, <hi>Salvation to our God, that ſits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, Rev.</hi> 7.10. <hi>To him who loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. To be taken up, with ſuch ſweet Soliloquies in our ſelves about this Subject, and with ſuch Songs of Praiſe to Him, who hath given us ſo noble a Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Life which is convoyed to us, by His Blood, is ſure a ſuitable Uſe of this Point; For if our Life be of much Worth, He muſt be of Infinitly much more Worth in Himſelf, and ſhould be ſo to us, who purchaſed it at ſuch a Dear Price.</p>
            <p>The 2d. <hi>Uſe,</hi> is to exhort you whom we ſuppoſe to be renewed, (as ſome of you now hearing me are, and O! that all of you were) that when ever ye think of injoying of Heaven, and Glory, ye would think alſo, whence it came to be thus with you; O! think on that Rock, out of which ye are hewen, as ye are Believers, and are intitled to Life; And this will lay the Natural Pride, which, Alas! too oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Believers have going along with their Hope of Life; as if they were ſomething better by Nature then others, becauſe they have hope to come to Heaven; but think this alſo with your ſelves, that there are no thanks to you, but to Him, <hi>who loved you, and waſhed you from your ſins, in his own blood;</hi> which ſhould make you walk ſoftly, and with a ſtopp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That He might have a <hi>Seed;</hi> that poor Bodies that were Dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and without Life might be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and that ſuch as had no hope of Heaven might have it; That in ſuch a way an entry into Heaven ſhould be made to Sinners; this is the wonder; do ye Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, indeed believe this, that the Lord's Deſign, in all the Work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was to bring Dead Sinners to Life? This is it that makes Chriſt get the Name of a <hi>Saviour,</hi> That the <hi>Shepherd being ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, God might turn his hand on the little Ones.</hi> And therefore, as a 4th. <hi>Uſe,</hi> See here a good ground, whereupon to Preach to you by the Death of Chriſt, the Offer of Life, and the Remiſſion of Sin, as the Apoſtle hath it, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.39, 40. <hi>Be it known therefore to you men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you, the forgivenneſs of ſins, And by him, all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not he juſtified by the law of Moſes;</hi> And there is never a Text, that ſpeaks of the end of Chriſt's Sufferings, but readily, it ſome way layes a ground, how a Sinner may get Life; And it is, as it were a Proclamation to Sinners, to make the right uſe of what is offered to them: If our Lord Jeſus had not Suffered, there had not been a warrand for us to ſpeak of Life to you; There had been no Treaty with Sinners, no Door opened, for acceſs to Heaven, no ground for any to call God <hi>Father:</hi> But on the Contraire, Chriſt having Suffered, and Satisfied Juſtice, it giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And therefore, as a 5th. <hi>Uſe,</hi> We beſeech you to concur with Chriſt, in the Deſign of His laying down of His Life; Is it not, think ye, great Ingratitude to Him, and great Cruelty to your ſelves, that when the Lord hath Deſigned ſuch a thing, by the laying down of His Life; That ye ſhould, as far as ye can, ſtand in the way of it?

If the Heart be honeſt, and ye can ſincerely ſay, content Lord, and will creep in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der His Wings, that ye may be found in Him; and may be covered with His Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; There is good ground to expect a cloſed Bargain: For our Lord purpoſly Died, that He might <hi>have a Seed;</hi> and is calling upon you for this very End; and will not go back of His Word, if ye be content to Bargain with Him; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would again ſay unto you, ſhift not His call; It is His Deſign, to have a Seed; and it ſhould be yours, to ſeek to be of that Seed: O! let Him have His Errand among you; The Offer comes (as I juſt now ſaid) to every one of your Doors, and your anſwer will be, and muſt be, either <hi>yea,</hi> or <hi>nay,</hi> either that ye are content to be His Children, that His Grace may be Glorified in you; Or that ye are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and that <hi>ye will not come to him, that ye may have life;</hi> As it is, <hi>John</hi> 5.

            <p>There are two things, which we hinted at the laſt Day, that we ſhall now ſpeak a Word to, and the firſt of them is this.</p>
            <p>That it is an agreed upon, and a conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Article, in the Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that our Lord Jeſus ſhall, and muſt <hi>have a Seed:</hi> This is a moſt certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Truth; It is an effect laid down here, as a neceſſary conſequent of His <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of his Soul for ſin:</hi> It's a determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thing, if we look, 1.

If we look to the <hi>Seed</hi> that He ſhall have; They are particularly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon, to wit, how many Children He ſhall have; and who they ſhall be: That was both a Promiſe in the Covenant, and a Propheſie, as we have it, <hi>Pſal</hi> 22.

It's clear alſo, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the End of this Tranſaction, which is, to glorifie the Grace of God, by Chriſt's Purchaſe, in the Salvation of Elect Sinners; In reſpect of this End, it cannot fail, but Chriſt muſt have a <hi>Seed,</hi> that that End may be attained: So then, our Lord Jeſus muſt have, and certainly ſhall have, many that ſhall partake of Eternal Life by Him.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. There is here Ground of Glad Tydings to Sinners, And that which makes the Covenant of Redemption, to be diſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly called the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and that made the Angels to Sing <hi>Glory be to God in the higheſt, peace on earth, and good will to men;</hi> That there is ſuch a Covenant laid down, for bringing Life to Dead Sinners; And that the Father, and the Mediator are Delighted, Comforted, (to ſay ſo) Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and well pleaſed with Sinners, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Uſe of the Mediator for Life: Is there then any Sinner here, whoſe Conſcience layes open to Him, His hazard, applyes the Curſe to Him, and paſſes Sentence on himſelf, and hath ſome deſire to be at Chriſt; and yet wots not if He will hold out the Golden Scepter? Behold this Text doth hold it out to ſuch, and bids them come in boldly, for Chriſt makes them welcome; yea, the Lord Jehovah makes them welcome; It's the Fathers, and Chriſt's delight, that thou come foreward. If there be a Doctrine in all the Scripture Sweet, it's this; and without th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For, 1. If it had not been the Lord Jehovah His delight, why then did He make ſuch a Covenant? Why did He (as it were) part and ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If He had not had a great delight in the Salvation of Sinners, would He have taken that way, to Smite the only Son of His Love, to ſpare them? And if it had not been the Sons Pleaſure, would He, with ſuch delight have undertaken, and done the Fat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:152256:179"/> of a warrand from Him, to be Reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and they have Chriſt's warrand, in a more peculiar manner, as the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of His Church, to tell you, it's a thing the Lord Jehovah, and the Mediator have Pleaſure in, even in this, that ye ſhould be reconciled. 3. Wherefore are the many expoſtulations with Sinners, that <hi>they will not come unto Christ, for Life, That they will not be gathered,</hi> that, <hi>when he streatches out his hands all the day long, they will not behold him?</hi> &amp;c. Do not all theſe Confirm this Truth, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing He is better pleaſed with, then with a Sinners coming to Chriſt for Life? Let me therefore beſeech you, by the Love that ye pretend to Jeſus Chriſt, and in His Name, and in the Name of Jehovah ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt you, be ye Reconciled to God in Chriſt, let Him have Satisfaction; Let this pleaſure be done to the Lord, even to receive Life from Him: This is no hard, nor hurtfull, no unreaſonable, nor rigid Requeſt, I am ſure; all that He requires of you, is, that ye would come to Him, and get Life: O! if we could but ſuitably apprehend this, to be that which the Lord aims at, in this Preached Goſpel; that we might, (to ſpeak ſo with Reverence) put an Obligation on the Majeſty of God, in making ſure in this His own way, the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our own Souls; and that we could not do Him a better turn (But I pray take the Expreſſions Right, for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſet forth His Love, but in our own Language, which comes infinitely far ſhort of the thing) we could not find in our hearts, to refuſe to grant ſuch a loving, and highly rational a requiſt; As it is ſure then upon the one ſide, that we cannot do that which will pleaſe Him better; So it's as ſure on the other ſide, that we cannot do that which will diſpleaſe Him more, then to ſlight His Counſell in this; Though we would give our Bodies to be burnt and all our Goods to the Poor; He will not count it a pleaſure done Him, if this be not done; We would look upon this, as low Condeſcendencie, and great Grace in the Lord, that He ſeeks no more of us, but the making ſure Eternal Life to our ſelves, as that which will be moſt pleaſing to Him; It's even as if a Son ſhould ſay to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Father, what will pleaſe thee? And as the Father ſhould ſay to his Son; Son have a care of thy ſelf, and that will pleaſe me; Becauſe, by our ſo doing, He reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth His great End; to wit, the glorifying of His Grace and Love, which Sinners, by their unbelief, do what in them lyeth to marr and obſtruct: If we could ſpeak ſeriouſly to you, in this matter, it might be a Text to ſpeak on every day: Always ſeing He hath purchaſed Redemption to Sinners at a dear Rate, And all that He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of you, is to cloſe with Him, and to ſeek after the Application of His Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe; We again earneſtly pray you, be ye reconciled to God, and take heed that ye receive not this Grace in vain; What can ye do that will be pleaſing to God, or profitable to your ſelves without this? Or, what Fruit of the Goſpel can be brought forth, when this Fruit is not brought forth, If Jeſus Chriſt, in His Offices get not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and if His Offering be not fled to for making of your Peace; We may, in Conſideration of this great and grave Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, go from the Congregation partly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, that there is ſuch a Doctrine to be ſpoken of; though we cannot, Alas! ſpeak of it ſuitably, And partly afraid, leaſt we be found, as far as we can, thuart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with, and running Croſſe unto God's good Will, and Deſigne in it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, all the Favour and Grace He hath made Offer of to us; It were good that we carried ſerious Meditation on this Subject, along with us.</p>

            <p>THis is a great Work that the Mediator hath to do; a great Price that He hath to lay down for the ſatisfying of Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and for redeeming of the loſt Elect: Now, what ſhall He have for all the travell of His Soul; Here it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and the Terms of the Covenant of Redemption again compended; as for the Effects and Fruits of His Death, ſpoken of in the cloſe of the former Verſe, <hi>He ſhal prolong his days,</hi> That being ſpoken to, on the matter: from Verſe 8. <hi>And the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</hi> Being ſpoken to, by another lately, in your hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in part by us, <hi>John</hi> 17.4. And from <hi>verſe</hi> 10. Now read over again; we ſhall forbear further ſpeaking to them, and come to that which follows in the 11. <hi>Verſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Verſe then, There are theſe three. 1. An offer and promiſe made to the Mediator; That if He will accept of the propoſall, and lay down His Life for Redeeming of the loſt Elect; it ſhall not be fruitleſs, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travell of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> 2. The way how this ſatisfaction ſhall be brought about; <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie many.</hi> That is, by Faith in Him, His Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe ſhall be applyed to all theſe for whom He ſhould ſuffer, who thereby ſhould be juſtified. 3. The ground of this, which alſo ſhews the way, how He ſhall juſtifie many; <hi>For he ſhall bear their iniquities,</hi> That is, by His undertaking, and paying of their Debt, He ſhould meritoriouſly procure their Abſolution, and the ſetting of them free. In the firſt part, we have theſe three things implyed. 1. A ſuppoſed condition, or reſtipulation on the Mediator's ſide; That His Soul ſhall be put <hi>to travell,</hi> which expreſſes both the Nature of His Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that they ſhall not only be Bodily, but alſo, and mainly, Soul-ſufferings, and Conflicts with the Wrath of God; which the Elect's ſins deſerved, as the main and principall thing Articled, and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Price of their Redemption lay; And the Greatneſs, and Extremity of His Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, here called <hi>Travell,</hi> from the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of a Woman in Travell, and <hi>the Travell of his Soul;</hi> This being the way foretold, how Chriſt ſhould be uſed; He ſhould Travell in His Sufferings, to procure Life to His People. 2. A Promiſe made to Him; That <hi>He ſhall ſee the travell of his ſoul,</hi> That is, He ſhall not bring forth wind, but ſhall have a large Off ſpring, which in the 2d. part of the <hi>verſe,</hi> is called a <hi>Juſtifying of many by his knowledge;</hi> This is the Fruit He ſhall have of His Soul-travel. 3. The extent of this, which is His be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Satisfied,</hi> and quiet; Which looks to two things. 1. To the certain and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ſucceſs of His Sufferings; Not one of the Elect ſhall be amiſſing; None that He hath bought Life to ſhall want it, He ſhall get as many Juſtified and Saved, as He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned for. 2. To the great delight, and complacencie that our Lord hath, in performing the Work of Redemption, and in Sinners getting the benefit of it; He ſhall think all well beſtowed when they come to get the Application thereof, and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:152256:180"/> by Faith in Him to be Juſtified. From the firſt of theſe, <hi>Obſerve</hi> That the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, in performing the Work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in ſatisfying the Juſtice of God, for the Debt of Elect Sinners; was not only put to Externall and Bodily, but alſo and mainly, to Inward, Spirituall, and Soul-ſufferings; Or the Redeeming of loſt Sinners coſt our Lord Jeſus much Soul-travell and Suffering; we have hinted at His Sufferings often before, but this place eſpecially, ſpeaks out His Soul-ſufferings, and the Inward Anguiſh, and Agony that He was brought under; We ſhall therefore ſpeak alittle to this, it being moſt uſeful, and extenſive in the Fruits and Benefits of it to the People of God; And ſhall 1. confirm it by ſome places in the Goſpel, where we have the fulfilling of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie clearly holden out to us; And 2dly. By a fourfold Reaſon: Only take this for an advertiſement, that when we ſpeak of the Soul-ſufferings of Our Lord, we do no mean of any Sufferings after Death (as Papiſts falſly calumniat us) but of theſe Sufferings, eſpecially that were about the time of His Paſſion, when He got the full Cup of the Fathers Wrath put in His hand towards His approaching to the Croſs, and when He was upon it, when He was araigned, and when He was exacted upon, for the Elect's Debt: The firſt paſſage to confirm it, is that of <hi>John</hi> 12.27. <hi>Now is my ſoul troubled, and what ſhall I ſay? Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſave me from this hour;</hi> Here His Soul-ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rings begin clearly to ſhew themſelves when there was no Croſs, nor Suffering in His Body, yet He is put to ſuch a pinch, conſidered as Man, that He is, in a manner, <hi>non-pluſſed,</hi> and put to ſay, <hi>what ſhall I ſay;</hi> the horror of that which was begun, and was further coming on Him, being beyond all expreſſion, whereupon follows that prayer, <hi>Father, ſave me from this hour;</hi> His Sinle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Humane Nature ſcarring ſome way to enter on it. The 2d. paſſage is that of <hi>John</hi> 13.21. where it's ſaid, That <hi>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be troubled in ſpirit and testified,</hi> &amp;c. But let us come forward, and put <hi>Matthew Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> together, and we ſhall ſee what an inexpreſſible and unconceivable, hight and heap of ſorrows, His Soul-trouble and travell will amount to; <hi>Matthew</hi> ſayes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 26.37, 38. That <hi>He began to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, and very heavy;</hi> And in the next words, <hi>my ſoul is exceeding ſorrowfull, even unto death;</hi> and what made Him ſo ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull? The next words, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible let this cup paſſe from me,</hi> ſhew that it was the Cup of His Fathers Wrathfull Juſtice put in His hand; <hi>Mark</hi> ſayes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.33. Thar when He came to the Garden, <hi>He began to be ſore amazed, and very heavy:</hi> A wonderfull expreſſion to be uſed of the Son of God; that the Perſon that was God ſhould be <hi>amazed,</hi> yet being conſidered as Man he was ſo; <hi>Luke</hi> ſayes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.44. That <hi>being in an agony, he prayed more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly;</hi> There is a ſore Exerciſe and ſad Soul-travell indeed, when the Sword of Gods Juſtice awaked againſt the Man that was <hi>Gods fellow;</hi> and when He hath the Curſe that was due to all the Elect, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter and meet with; This was ſuch a Combat, the like whereof was never in the World, And the effect of it is; <hi>His ſweat as great drops of blood falling down to the ground;</hi> when there was no hand of Man ſtirring Him, nor any Man to trouble Him by Him; but God as a ſevere, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily rigid exactor, puting Him to pay the Debt, which He had undertaken to pay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to His Obligation; The inward preſſour of His Soul preſſeth great drops of Blood from His Body: And if we will yet look a little forward, to <hi>Math.</hi> 27.46. we will find Him brought to that extremity on the Croſs, that He cryes, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Which though it ſay that there was ſtill Faith in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, in adhering to the Father as His God; yet it ſets out that great horrour which He had inwardly to wreſtle with; when there was ſome reſtraint on the ſenſibly comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence of the God-head: Now when all the Evangeliſts concur ſo maſſilie, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically, and ſignificantly to expreſs this, wealing out, and pitching upon ſuch weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Words to ſet it forth by; We may ſee it to be deſignedly holden forth, as a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Truth, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the Faith of the People of God may be ſtrongly confirmed therein.</p>
            <pb n="355" facs="tcp:152256:180"/>
            <p>To confirm it yet further, put theſe four together. 1. The eſtate that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are naturally lying in for whom Chriſt undertakes, they are naturally under Sin; lyable to the curſe of God, for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing of His Law; which had ſaid, <hi>The ſoul that ſins ſhall die, and curſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d is every one that continueth not in all things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of the law to do them.</hi> 2. Add to this the ſuppoſition of Chriſt's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to be the Elects Cautioner, and to ſatisfie for their Debt; whereby he ſteps into their room, takes on their Debt; And (as the word is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. Becomes ſin for them.</hi>) Is content to be lyable to, and to be purſued by Juſtice for their Debt, and though here there be a relaxation in reſpect of the Perſons of the Elect for whom the Cautioner ſtands good, yet in reſpect of the Curſe and Death due to them, there is no relaxation; but the ſame thing due to them is laid on Him; as it is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>He hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a curſe for us.</hi> In every thing He was put to pay the equivalent, for making up the Satisfaction due to Juſtice, and theſe two being put together, that Elect Sinners were obnoxious to Wrath, and that our Lord came in their Room, He behoved to be put to ſad and ſore Soul-ſuffering. 3. Conſider God's end in the Work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, which is to point out the inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of His wonderfully condeſcending Grace and Mercy, in exacting of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Cautioner, and in ſetting the Sinner free; that His Grace may be ſo Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, as their ſhall be a proof given of His Juſtice, and Soveraignity going along with it, and Infinit Wiſdom being ſet on Work to glorifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſity for the promoving of this end, that the Mediator ſhall thus ſatisfie, and the more full the Satisfaction be, the more conſpicuouſly do the Grace and Juſtice of God ſhine forth, and are Glorified, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that word, <hi>Rom</hi> 3.26 <hi>To declare his righteouſn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſs that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that ſhall believe in Jeſus:</hi> This is the end of Chriſt's being made a Propitiation, that God may be manifeſted to be Spotleſſe and Pure in His Juſtice, as well as Free and Rich in His Mercy and Grace; who, having given a Law to Man, will not acquite the tranſgreſſion thereof, without a condigne Satisfaction. 4 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that it is indeed a great thing to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Juſtice for Sin; that it's more to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Juſtice for all the Sins of one Perſon, which all the Angells in Heaven, and Men on Earth cannot do; and therefore the puniſhment of the Damned in Hell is drawn out to Eternities length, and yet there is never a Compleat Equivalent Satisfaction made to Juſtice; but it is moſt of all to ſatisfie Juſtice, for all the Sins of all the Elect; who, though they be few in compariſon of the Reprobat World, yet ſimply conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they are many; yea, even innumerable; And our Lord having taken all their Sins on Him, He is peremptorly required to ſatisfie for them all; And if this withall be added, that He is to ſatisfie for all the Sins of all the Elect at once, in a very ſhort time, and hath the Curſe and Wrath of God due to them, Muſtered and Marſhaled in Batallie againſt Him, and as it were in a great Body, in a moſt formidable manner, marching up towards Him, and ſeriouſly charging Him; and all the Wrath which they ſhould have drunken through all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (which yet would never have been drunk out, nor made the leſs) put in one Cup, and propined to Him; as the Word is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>He ſhall drink of the brook in the way:</hi> The Wrath of God running like an impetuous River, muſt be drunk up at once, and made dry by Him: Theſe being put together, do clearly, and convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſhew, that it could not but be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible and inconceivable Soul-travell and Suffering, that our Lord Jeſus was put to.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of this Doctrine is large, and the 1. <hi>Uſe</hi> is this, T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In reſpect of God's People, it's uſefull, that they may be through, and clear in the Reality and Worth of Chriſt's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; He having no other End in it, but to ſatisfie Juſtice for their Sin. 4. It's uſefull to ſhew the Vanity and Emptineſſe of Mens Suppoſed, and Fancied Merits, and of any thing that can be alleadged to be in Mans Suffering, or doing for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of Divine Juſtice; ſeing it drew ſo deep on Chriſt the Cautioner; And here two groſs <hi>Errours</hi> come to be Refuted, and Reprobated; One of the <hi>Socinians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who ſeek quite to overturn Chriſt's Satisfaction; And another of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that miniſh His Satisfaction; and Extenuat and Derogat from the great Priviledge of the Pardon of Sin, as if any thing could procure it, but this Satisfaction of Chriſt by His Soul-trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell; both which are aboundantly refuted by this Text.</p>
            <p>But to ſpeak a word more particularly to the <hi>First,</hi> For clearing of which ye will aſk; What could there be to affect the Holy Humane Soul of our Lord? Or what was that wherein His Soul-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings did conſiſt? But before we ſpeak to this, we would premit this Word of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement in the entry, That there are two ſorts of Puniſhments, or Penal Effects of Sin; The 1. Sort are ſuch as are ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Penal and Satisfying, as proceeding from ſome extrinſick cauſe; The 2d. ſort are ſinfull; One Sin in the Righteous Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God drawing on another; And this proceeds not ſimply from the nature of Juſtice, but from the nature of a meer ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo from an intrinſick cauſe of a Sinful Principle in the Creature: Now when we ſpeak of the Soul-ſufferings of Chriſt, which He was put to in Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying for the Sins of the Elect; We mean of the former, that is, Sufferings that are ſimply Penall; For there was no intrinſick Principle of Corrupt Nature, nor ground of Chal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enge in Him; as there is in Sinfull Creatures; And therefore we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of His Soul-ſufferings, as of ſome thing inflicted from without; and are not to conceive of them as we do of Sinfull Creatures, or that have Sin in them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was altogether free.</p>
            <p>Having premitted this, we ſhall ſpeak a little to theſe two. 1. To that wherein this Soul-ſuffering did not conſiſt. 2. To that wherein it did conſiſt. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wherein it was not. 1. We are not to ſuppoſe, or imagine any actuall ſeparation betwixt His God-head, and His Man-head; as if there had been an interruption of the Perſonall Union; not ſo for the Union of the two Natures in one Perſon remains ſtill, He was God and Man ſtill, though, (as was hinted before) there was a Suſpenſion of ſuch a Meaſure, at leaſt of the ſenſibly Comforting Influence of the Divine Nature, from the Humane, as had wont to be let out thereto; And yet there was even then a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining Power flowing from the God-head that Supported Him, ſo, that He was not ſwallowed up of that which would have quite, and for ever ſwallowed up all Creatures, as is evident in this crying, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Which ſhewes, that though the Union, and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtood firm, yet a comfortable Influence was much reſtrained. 2. There was no ſinfull Fretting, no Impatiencie, nor carnal Anxiety in our Lord, all along His Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for He did moſt willingly undergo them, and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d a kindly ſubmiſſion in them all; As is evident by theſe Words <hi>But for this cauſe came I into this hour,</hi> And <hi>not my will but thy will be done.</hi> 3. There was not in H m any diſtruſt of Gods Love, nor any unbelief of His Approbation before God, neither any the leaſt D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ffidence, as to the Out-gate; For in the Sadeſt and Sharpeſt of all His Conflicts, He was clear about His Fathers Love to Him; that the Relation ſtood firm, and that there would be a Comfortable Out-gate, as His Prayer before ſhews, wherein He ſtyles God, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> And theſe hardeſt like Words utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Him on the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God why haſt thou forſaken me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>rts His Intereſt, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> Though He
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:152256:181"/> was moſt terribly Aſſaulted, yet the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation did not prevaill over Him. 4. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we to conceive, that there was any inward Confuſion, Challenge, or Gnawing of Conſcience in Him, ſuch as is in Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Sinners caſt under the Wrath of God, Becauſe there was no inward cauſe of it, nor any thing that could breed it; yea, even in that wherein He was Cautioner, He was clear, that He was doing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, and finiſhing the Work that was committed to Him; and that even under the greateſt Apprehenſions of Wrath; Therefore all ſuch things are to be guarded againſt, in our Thoughts, leaſt otherwayes, we reflect upon our Innocent and Spotleſs Mediator. But 2. To ſpeak a Word to that wherein it doth conſiſt? 1. It did conſiſt (as we hinted before) in the God-head's Suſpending it's Comfortable Influence for a time from the Humane Nature; Though our Lord had no Culpable Anxiety, yet He had a Sinleſſe Fear, conſidering Him as Man; and that the infinit God was An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and Executing Angryly the Sentence of the Law againſt Him, (Though He was not angry at Him conſidered as in Himſelf, but as He ſtood in the room of the Elect, as their Cautioner, of whom He was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the Payment of their Debt) and could not but be in a wonderfull amazment, as the Word is, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.33. <hi>He was ſore amazed,</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. It's ſaid, <hi>when he had offe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed up prayers, and ſupplications with ſtrong cryes and tears, unto him that was able to ſave him from death, he was heard in that which he feared.</hi> Which looks to His wreſtling in the Garden, 2. He had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible ſenſe of grief; not only from the petty outward Afflictions that He was under; (which may be called petty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, though they were very great in themſelves) but alſo from the Torrent of Wrath flowing in, on His Soul; That Cup behoved to have a moſt bitter Reliſh, and an inconceivable Anguiſh with it, when He was a drinking of it, as appeared in His Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. O! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s He was Pained and Pinched in His Soul? The Soul being eſpecially ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Wrath of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 3 It conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſort of wonderfull Horrour, which no queſtion, the marching up (to ſay ſo) of ſo many mighty Squadrons of the highly provoked Wrath of God; and making ſo Furious and Formidable an Aſſault on the Innocent Humane Nature of Chriſt (that conſidered ſimply in it's ſelf, was a finit Creature) behoved neceſſarily to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with; Hence He prayes, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible let this cup depart from me;</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating, that there was a Sinleſs Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a holy Abhorrence to middle with it, and to adventure upon it. Though we have not Hearts rightly to conceive, nor Tongues ſuitable to expreſs thoſe moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Sufferings, yet theſe things ſhew, that our Lord Jeſus was exceedingly put to it in His Holy Humane Soul.</p>
            <p>The 2, <hi>Uſe</hi> Serves to ſtir us up to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the Love of God the Father, that gave His own Son, and exacted the Elect's Debt of Him; and made the Sword of His Juſtice to awake againſt Him; And to wonder at the Love of the Son, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadged to be ſurety for them; And hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Himſelf ſo Low to lift them up; It was wonderfull that He ſhould ſtoup to become M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And therefore not only, in reſpect of the ommand, but of the Conſequent that will follow the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of it: Be txhorted, if ye mind not to take your hazard of Wrath, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, in God's way to get your Intereſt in this Satisfaction which the Cautioner hath made well ſecured: Ther is here a ſolid ground for Faith, to expect that this Satisfaction will do the turn, of all them who will make uſe of it; And a moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Motive to ingadge them that are lying under Sin, to embrace, to cloſe with, and to reſt upon this Offered Salvation; That, this Grace be not received in vain; Is there not a Teſtimony in your Conſciences of the Former, and why do ye not make uſe of the Latter?

               </gap> foregoing Words; wherein it's ſaid, <hi>He ſhall ſee his ſeed;</hi> Which is repeated here, when it's ſaid; <hi>He ſhall be ſatisfied;</hi> So that as a Mother is in Travell, for bringing forth of a Child; So ſayes he, ſhall Chriſt be put to Soul-travell, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life and Immortality to the Seed given to Him, to be ſaved by Him; And ſeing He is put to Travell, He muſt needs bring forth, and <hi>ſee his ſeed:</hi> Here we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude that of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 66.9. <hi>Shall I bring to the birth, and not cauſe to bring forth? ſaith the Lord; ſhall I cauſe to bring forth, and ſhut the womb? ſaith thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have ſpoken of the Nature and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe Sufferings; Now ere we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to any moe <hi>Obſervations,</hi> we would ſpeak a Word further to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of this; It being indeed an Eater, out of which comes Meat; and a Strong, out of which comes Sweet; Theſe pangs having calmed and quieted the Pangs and Showres (to ſpeak ſo) of many Travelling Souls, and brought forth a Birth at laſt.</p>
            <p>And therefore, beſide what I ſpake to in the <hi>Uſe,</hi> the laſt day, I would add this, That we would endeavour to have the ſolid Faith, not only of His Sufferings, but of the Greatneſs of His Sufferings imprinted deeply on our hearts; That (I ſay) the Sufferings of a Dying, Blood-ſweating Chriſt, Wreſtling and Strugling, even to His being in an Agony, with the Wrath of God, and puting up ſtrong Cryes with Tears, may be born in on our hearts; and
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:152256:183"/> that we may throughly be perſwaded of the greatneſs of the Work of Redemption, and that it was a moſt Dear and Coaſtly Bargain to Chriſt; For it was not Gold nor Silver, it was not Kingdoms nor viſible Worlds, nor Angells that were given as a Price for Elect Sinners; but it was the precious Blood of the Son of God; Nay, it was the bitter and ſharp Soul-travell, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We ſhall draw what we would ſay on it, to theſe four heads. 1. To ſomething for Inſtruction. 2. To ſomething for Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. 3. To ſomething for Exhortation. 4. To ſomething for Reproof, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation.</p>
            <p>I ſay, 1. It ſerves for <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> and ye would from it be Inſtructed in ſeveral things. 1. How to think aright of the great Severity of the Juſtice of God, and of the Horrour of Wrath, and of the dreadfull Conſequ nts of Sin, which it will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have following on it; May it not make your Souls to tremble to think upon, and conſider that our Lord Jeſus was brought to ſuch a paſs, as to be in ſuch an <hi>Agony,</hi> to be ſo <hi>exceeding ſorrowfull,</hi> and even <hi>amazed;</hi> To be ſo troubled in Soul, that he was thereby made to <hi>ſweat great drops of blood,</hi> and to be wreſtling with ſomewhat, that His holy Humane Nature had a ſcarring at: O! the deſert and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Sin is dreadfull, when the Law pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues its Controverſie, and when Juſtice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts what a broken Covenant deſerves; Alace!

               </gap> an evil thing Sin is, and what a dreadfull thing it is to fall into the hands of an angry God; O! that ye would think upon it, that ye may beware of Sin, by all means, and may alwayes be minding that Word which our Saviour hath, <hi>If theſe things be done in the green tree, what ſhall be done in the dry?</hi> If it was ſo done with Him? who in the Action (if I may ſo call it) was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His Fathers will, and giving an admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proof of His reſpect to the Honour of God, What wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hear it, and tremble, and be perſwaded, that the Horror that Sin ſhall bring upon the Sinner, when God comes to reckon with him, is inexpreſſible. 2. Be Inſtructed, and ſee here, how great the difficultie is of making peace with God, when once His Law is broken; A thing that is little believed by moſt, who are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to think that they will get God ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pleaſed and pacifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d to be made a Sacrifice for Sin? Sinners groſly
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:152256:184"/> ignorant miſtakes of the Juſtice of God, appear palpably in this; There was never a Perſon that was called to it, and did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to remove God's Wrath from others, but our Lord Jeſus; And ye ſee here what it coſt Him; And what do ye imagine will be the lot of others, who ſhall lye under it eternally. 3. See here the Worth and Weight of a Soul, and the great moment of the Salvation of a Soul; Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls are of much worth, and though Men often ſell them at an cheap and eaſie Rate, yet our Lord Jeſus bought Souls dear; It's true, Souls conſidered in themſelves, are not worthy of the Price laid down for them; But being conſidered with reſpect to the end for which they are deſigned; to wit, the glorifying of the Riches of the Grace and Mercy of God, and their injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Him, They are of much worth; Ah! that men ſhould ſell that Soul ſo very cheap, when our Lord bought Souls ſo very dear. 4. See here, the Solidity, Fulneſs, and Satisfactorineſs of the Price that Jeſus Chriſt gave to Juſtice, for the Souls of His People? It cannot ſure but be a fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Price, that ſuch a Perſon ſhould Suffer, and Suffer ſo much; Even to be put to Soul-travel; for which there could be no Reaſon, neither could it have any other End, but the ſatisfying of Divine Juſtice, for the Sins of the Elect; And conſidering theſe, His Sufferings in the Degrees of them, which was ſo very high; And in the uſe of them, in Gods Purpoſe and Decree, and in the End of them, which was to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the Juſtice of God, and to make His Grace Glorious, It cannot but be a moſt Solid, Full, and Satisfying Price; So that a Soul may have here a ſufficient ground to build its Salvation upon; And the more low-that the Mediator was brought by His Sufferings, the more ſolid and ſicker is the ground of our Faith, yea, this is the End why He came ſo low. 5. See here how greatly we are in Chriſt's Debt, That when Juſtice was provoked, and Sinners had loſed themſelves; and when nothing elſe could be admitted, but all other Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were rejected, He was graciouſly pleaſed to yeeld Himſelf to be the Sacrifice, by His extream, and moſt exquiſit Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; moſt pleaſantly and heartſomly, ſaying, <hi>Lo, I come in the volum of thy book, it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God; By the which will,</hi> ſayeth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>We are ſanctified;</hi> And by it we have acceſs to Eternall Life; It had been much, if He had made a New World for Believers to dwell in, nay it had been much if He had provided Angels to Mollify, and Mitigat their Sufferings, and to give them drops of water to cool their Tongues in Hell; But that He His own bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſelf, ſhould decline no Soul-travel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Bodily Sufferings, to redeem them from the Curſe; How much, how unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably much are they oblidged to Jeſus Chriſt? If we were ſuitably ſenſible of our hazard, and clear, as to our Intereſt in theſe Sufferings, it could not be, but our Souls would leap ſomeway within us, as the Babe did in <hi>Elizabeths</hi> womb, on this conſideration, that a Cautioner, and Saviour hath come, and payed the Price that was due by us, to the Juſtice of God; This is a greater obligation then His making of the World, for an habitation to Sinners, Nay a greater obligation then His giving of Heaven to us, if abſtracted from Chriſt: O! So well as it would become us, in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Words, to ſtand and pauſe, and to ſay, Is it ſo indeed, that Chriſt gave Himſelf thus for Sinners, and for me? This is it which opens the door of Acceſs to God, and makes a Bridge over the Gulf, that is betwixt God and Sinners; He was ſmitten, that by His Stroaks, and Strips health might be brought to us; He was content to undergo ſore Soul-travel, that thereby Life might be brought to us.</p>
            <p>That which we mainly aim at in this Branch of the <hi>Uſe,</hi> is, That ye would look to the Mercy purchaſed by this Soul-travel, as your great obligation; And at what a Rate you have the Offer of Grace, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to Heaven; When He made the World, Heaven, and Earth, Sun, Moon, Stars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſpake the Word, and it was done, their needed no more, but <hi>let ſuch a thing be and it was,</hi> but the work of Redemption was of another ſort, and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:152256:184"/> brought about at a high and dearer Rate; Therefore among all the things which the Goſpel holds out, put a ſpeciall Price on theſe things that are the fruits of Chriſts Soul-travel; and conſider what a flight it will be, and what guilt it will involve you in, that He ſhould purchaſe Redemption ſo dear, and make offer of it ſo freely, and ye ſhould care little or nothing for it. 6. Be Inſtructed anent the abſolute neceſſity of being in Chriſts Debt, for the Uſe making and Application of His purchaſe; is there any man that can merit it, or render Him a recompence for it? If not; And if there be a neceſſity of making H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aven and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then ſure there is a n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ceſſity of being in Chriſts Debt, and of making uſe of His pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, for the attaining of that which He hath purchaſed; And men are not hardly delt with, nor ill come to, when this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed neceſſity is impoſed upon them, not to ſatisfie for themſelves (For what can they bring that will be an equivalent Price;) but to acquieſce in His Satisfaction made to Juſtice for them, and the rather, that they cannot bind Him to make application of it: Folk are very readily given to one of theſe two, either to miſken, and paſs by the Mediator, and ſo to preſume to make a new bargain for their Peace, by offering to drink themſelves for themſelves, of that Cup which Chriſt drank of, for that only was the Price of Souls; Or if they eſteem of Chriſts Satisfaction, they think to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidge Him, and to procure from Him the Application of His Purchaſe, by their Prayers and good Living: But what is there in this, more then is in the former? What Price is there that can be given to Him, that is equivalent to His Sufferings? It muſt therefore of neceſſity come to this, That as it was freely purchaſed, ſo it is freely applyed; and it were very ſuitable for Sinners to carry the Faith of this along with them in their boſome; If He procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heaven to us by His Soul-ſuffering and Travel, we cannot procure it to our ſelves, and therefore a neceſſity lyes on all that would be at Heaven, to be in Chriſt's common for it; And this is the up-ſhot of all, that Dyvour Sinners may know, that they are in His common: As for His Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, ſo for the Applic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. This Doctrine yeelds much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and it is the Fountain and Riſe of it; His Soul travel bought it all, and makes way to the bringing of us to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it: And in many reſpects, our Conſolation depends on it; We ſhall look upon it as the riſe thereof more generally, in theſe reſpects. 1. That to a poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner lying under the Curſe, there is a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of getting it put by, and kept off, that Heaven is not deſperat, and that the fear of coming before the Tribunal of Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice is not abſolute; for our Lord hath ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Juſtice; the Price that He laid down was not for nought, but levelled at this very Scope, as the Apoſtle hath it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. He was made ſin for us, that knew no ſin, that we</hi> Sinners <hi>might be made the righteouſneſs of God in,</hi> or through <hi>him?</hi> and what ſtrong Conſolation is this; for a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner under the Curſe of God, to have this word ſpoken to him, though thou cannot ſatisfy Juſtice for thy ſelf, yet there is a way laid down to ſatisfy it for thee; the Mediator having the Price that was requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed propoſed to Him, did not ſtick at the Terms, but held the Bargain, and hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly actually performed it. 2. It is a Conſolation in this reſpect, That not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is there a Compleat Satisfaction given to Juſtice, but a willing Saviour, ready to make that Satisfaction forthcoming, and to make it forthcoming freely; can there be a greater proof of our Lord Jeſus His Love to Sinners then this? That when they were conſidered with all their Debt lying on their heads, He undertook this Soul-travel for them, to procure them Salvation from Wrath and Juſtice; This is more then His giving them His Word for it, though that had been enough; it's more then the giving them His Oath, thus to commend His Love, As it is, <hi>John</hi> 15.13. <hi>Greater love hath no man then this, that a man ſhould lay down his life for his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iend; but,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8.10. <hi>God commends his love to us, that while we were yea ſinners, yea enemies Chriſt died for us;</hi> This good Shepherd laid down His Life
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:152256:185"/> for His Sheep. 3. It's a Conſolation in this reſpect, That there is alſo a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Lord Jehovah, the provoked Party, to accept of this Satisfaction, and to abſolve the Elect on account of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; For what I pray was all this Soul-travel that the Lord underwent? But Jehovah His transferring of the Debt of the Elect on Him, according to the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action that had paſt in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; He would never have made the Sword of His Juſtice to awake againſt the man that was His Fellow, if He had not been content to accept of His Satisfaction for them that ſhould make uſe of it; for we have not only the Mediator, and His <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to look upon in this Soul-travel, but alſo the contrivance of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, called in the former words, <hi>The pleaſure of the Lord;</hi> who, while we were enemies gave His Son, and was content to want Him for a time (to ſpeak ſo) and to be a diſtinct party to purſue Him; Is not this then a good Bargain, when we have a willing Mediator, and Merchant, content to give the Price and Satisfaction, and a gracious and willing God, content to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this Satisfaction, and both of them content to make the Application of it to us freely, As it is, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.18. Here is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſtrong Conſolation, the ground whereof will not fall, to wit, The medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators Soul-travel, and the Lord Jehovah will not caſt the Bargain; When the poor Sinner ſayes, I have nothing to pay, but there is a Price in Chriſt's Satisfaction of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Goſpel, and the Judge ſayes, admits it for the Sinner that lays claim to it, as if the Sinner had never Sinned, or had actually payed the Price himſelf.</p>
            <p>But 4. Look a little further, and we will find more Conſolation, though this be much; conſider a Sinner in a tempted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and under Sad-ſoul-exerciſe, that wots not what to do with Unbelief, with the Devil, and with the Wrath of God, all which are like to overwhelm and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them up, and the heart is like to ſink, here is the native and kindly Fountain for ſuch a Soul to drink at; That our Lord Jeſus ſuffered more, and that it was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Cup that He drank of, and drank out; And for theſe Ends 1. To take away the Sting and Bitterneſs of thy Cup. 2. To procure, and Meritoriouſly to Purchaſe a Freedom and Out-gate from theſe Temptations to thee. 3. Alſo, that He might be made a Sympathizing High-Prieſt, and the more compaſſionat towards the Perſon that ſhould be ſo Tempted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>Heb</hi> 2. <hi>ult. For that he himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, he is able alſo to ſuccour theſe that are tempted;</hi> He was Tempted, that He might have kindly ſympathy with Tempted Souls, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when ſuch are ready to fall a ſwoon, He dates and dandles them, as it were on His Knee, and when they are in hazard to turn their backs in the Conflict, He comes up with freſh ſtrength, and recruits them; So, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. <hi>We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like as we are, yet without ſin;</hi> We have ſuch an High Prieſt, as was not only mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſcorned of Men, and ſome way deſerted of God, but who was tempted, though not from Sin within (for He was without Sin) yet to Sin, for He was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by the Devil, and tempted to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and other groſs Sins, As is clear, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. though, (as He ſayeth Himſelf) <hi>The prince of this world had nothing in him;</hi> And He was not only tempted to Sin, but as if He had actually Sinned, He met with Wrath from all, there is a ſweet and ſtrong Sympathy flowing from ſuch bowels, as one Brother hath towards another, yea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivablie beyond the tendereſt bowels, that the moſt warmly loving Brethren in all the World have one towards another; And therefore he knows well what Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, Temptations riding thick (to ſpeak ſo) will attempt to beat in upon poor Souls, and can from experience Sympathy with them; It is not ſo to be underſtood, as if there were any addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all degree made to His Kindneſſe, Skill, and Grace, as He is God, Theſe being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit in Him, as ſo confedred, yet He being Man, as well as God, or having a humane Nature, He hath from His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:152256:185"/> experience a Sympathy, and that in a humane way, though infinitely above what we can conceive, with His own under their Temptations, and ſad Soul-exerciſes: And ſeing the Scripture holds out ſuch a thing as this, That our High Prieſt is a Man that hath bowels of Sympathy, it may ſufficiently warrand a Believer to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect much good, this, and other wayes from Chriſt, He having Grace infinit in Him, as God, and a tender heart as Man to befriend them, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat, and let out of that Grace unto them: And this is great ground of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Believers, under any Croſs and piece of hard exerciſe, to know that we have a Mediator, who knows in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though not the ſinfulneſſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies theſe hard exerciſes in us, yet what theſe fears are, of being ſhut out from God, and how dreadfull a thing it is to be at controverſie with Him; and is like to theſe, who having come thorow a ſad Tryall, and Piece of Exerciſe themſelves, are thereby the more ready to Sympathize with others under it. 5. and laſtly. The conſideration of this may comfort Believers even in their outward afflictions; it had been another ſort of Croſſes that they would have been made to meet with, if He had not taken this Cup of Wrath and dunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en it for them; and therefore they would be comforted, and bleſs God, who hath taken this Soul-travel from off them, and made way for a Retreat and Shelter for them in Him; and it ſhould even ſhame Believers, who are ready to think ſo much of any little Bit of inward Exerciſe, or of outward Affliction, ſeing our bleſſed Lord Jeſus endured ſo much, not only outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Bodily Affliction, but alſo ſo much inward Trouble, and Soul-travel, that thereby their Burden might be made light, and their yoke eaſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. For Exhortation, ſeing our Lord Jeſus was put to ſuch ſore Soul-travel, ſure it layes a great obligation on them, for whom he Suffered, to endeavour to make ſome Suitable and Gratefull Return; ſeing therefore we are ſo much in His Common, and Debt, we ſhould give Him a friendly meeting in theſe <hi>Four,</hi> which this calls for, 1. It calleth for Love to Him, that vented ſuch Love to us. 2. It calleth for Faith, That ſeing He gave ſuch a Price for us we ſhould truſt our Souls to Him. 3.

            <p>THe Work of Redemption is a buſineſs that was very gravely and very ſeriouſly contrived and proſecuted, in reſpect of God, and of the Mediator, there was much earneſtneſs in it as to them; and yet notwithſtanding (which is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) Men whom it concerns ſo much, whoſe Salvation depends on it, and to whom the benefit of it redounds, are but very little ſerious in their thoughts of it; Our Lord Jeſus was in Travel, Soul-travel, ſore Soul-travel to bring about this Work; and that the Goſpel might be Preached to Sinners, that they might have thereby a ground to their Faith, to expect Life and Remiſſion of Sins through Him; Is it not then ſad, that we ſhould ſpeak and hear of it, and be in a manner, like the ſtone in the wall, no more, or little more affected with it, than if it were a matter that did not at all concern us? The Reading and Hearing of theſe Words will doubtleſs be a great Conviction to ſecure Sinners, that our Lord Jeſus was at ſuch pains, and put to ſuch ſore Soul-travel, and Suffering, and that yet ſuch Sinners were never ſtirred, nor made ſerious, to have the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Purchaſed Redemption made to them.</p>
            <p>The Scope of theſe Words is to ſhew the great inward Soul-travels, Conflicts, and Straits that our bleſſed Lord Jeſus had and was put to, in throughing of the Work of Redemption, and in paying the Price due to the Juſtice of God, for the Sins of the Elect; It's a wonder that ever we ſhould have it to ſpeak of, and that ye ſhould hear of this Subject, which is the very Text, (to ſay ſo) and Sum of the Goſpel; And therefore, before we leave it, we ſhall ſpeak a little more to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of it; and truly if we make not uſe of this Doctrine, we will make uſe of none; though I confeſs it is a great practique how to draw it to Uſe, and to conform ourſelves in our practice to the Uſe of it.</p>
            <p>We propoſed ſomethings the laſt day which we could not then proſecute; As 1. ſomething for Exhortation. 2. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Reproof, and Expoſtulation, which riſing clearly from the Doctrine drawn from the Words, we may now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a little in them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For Exhortation, Conſidering Chriſts Sufferings and the extremity of them, and that they were undergone for Sinners, we would exhort you to love Him as ye ought; There is ground and warrand here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it of you, ſeing that Love in His bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome came to ſuch an hight, that He was content to lay down His Life, yea, ſeing He was in ſuch a hot flame of Love, that the Cup of Wrath did not quench it, but His Love drank and dryed it up, <hi>Greater love then this hath no man;</hi> It is a moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Love conſidered with all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, whereby it is hightened; And there is ground here to excite and ſtir you up, to give Him a kindly meeting, and to welcome His Love with Love; It will ſure be a great ſhame, if our Lords Love
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:152256:187"/> ſtood at nothing, ſo that He might do the Fathers will, and finiſh the Work commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Him, which was the perfyting of the Work of Sinners Redemption, the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of His loſt Sheep; It every triffle, or any triffle, ſhall quench Love in our hearts to Him; O! What a ſhame will it be in the Day of Judgement to many, when this Man ſhall be brought forth loving this Idol, and another Man loving that Idol more then Chriſt, this Man loving his Luſt, that Man his Eaſe, and another Man h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s Wealth or Honour, and preferring them to Chriſt, and when it ſhall be found, that they would not quit nor part with their right Eye, nor their right Hand (which are not worth the name of <hi>Members,</hi> being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo, becauſe they are Members of the Body of Death) out of Love to Him: Think Folks what they will, that native impreſſion of the obligation that lyes upon them to love Chriſt, is wanting, and that Divine, and Soul-raviſhing Influence, that His Love ſhould have on hearts; It is true, ye all think, that ye love Him, unleſs it be ſome of them who indeed love Him; but if ye could reflect upon your ſelv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, ye would find that ye have little or no love at all to Him indeed: And therefore, for undeceiving of you, beſide what we ſaid the laſt day, take two or three Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of kindly love to Chriſt, 1. This Love is never ſatisfied with any degree, or meaſure that it hath attained, ſo as to ſit down on it; It hath theſe two things in it, A deſire to be further on in Love, and a weightedneſs that it cannot win at growth in Him; The loving Soul is diſpoſed to think, that it's Love to Chriſt is not worthy to be called Love, and it breaths after it, even to have it ſelf warmed therewith to Him, and to be brought to a further near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Him, as we may ſee through the Song of <hi>Solomon,</hi> And particularly <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. at the cloſe. <hi>There will I give thee my loves;</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>O that thou wert as my brother that ſucked the breaſts of my mother;</hi> Kindly Love to Him puts the Soul to long for an opportunity to vent it's Love towards Him. 2. Where this Love is, the Soul will be as ſerious in praying for it, that it may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, as if it wanted it, and it will be as much affected for the want of the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe of it, and will be as much chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged for coming ſhort in it, as it will be for any other Sin; There is no benefit that it ſeeks more after, then to have the heart circumciſed to love Him, and O! but it will be accounted a great benefit, to get love to Chriſt; And as it's one of the things that it ſeeks in Prayer, ſo it's one of the things that it eyeth in Repentance; It's much affected with the want of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes it to Him, and aggredges the Sin thereof againſt it ſelf, from this ground, that it loves nor Chriſt as it ſhould: I know not if there be much of this among us many will be ſorry if they fall in drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, or in any other groſs Sin, but O! how few repent of their want of Love to Chriſt, and that He gets not His own room in the heart. 3. Where this Love is, it is ever Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>judice of Chriſt: It's a ſad thing, when folks let their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons go our at random, and are not afraid, leſt they out-ſhoot themſelves in loving the World, their Pleaſures, their Credit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But rather they are like the whore in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> who ſayes <hi>come and let us take our fill of loves,</hi> Love to Chriſt, hath a Weanedneſs from theſe things, and a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy leaſt they uſurp a room in the heart, that is not due to them; Becauſe, as <hi>John</hi> ſayes, There is not a conſiſtency betwixt the love of God, and the love of the world in the heart, and therefore it's the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full care of a poor B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Bar, with confidence, Conſidering Jeſus Chriſt Crucified, and put to Soul-travel for Elect Sinners, who ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to Him; Which if it had not been, there had not been any ground for Faith; And the lower He came in His Sufferings, we have the more native and broad ground of Faith, and the ſtronger motive to draw us to take hold of Him, and to found and fix our Faith on His Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To clear this Branch of the <hi>Uſe</hi> a little. 1. Conſider here a ground for Faith, in a fourfold reſpect, And 2. The force of the motives that ariſe from theſe grounds, preſſing a ſenſible Sinner to exerciſe Faith on them, or on Him by them; And 3. The neceſſity that we are under, ſo to do.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> 1. In general, There is ground here to bring the heart to be through in the Hiſtoricall Faith, of what is ſpoken concerning the Truths of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; For, doth not this Soul-travel of Our Lord, ſay, That Men are lying Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in a ſinfull Condition, and obnoxious to Wrath? That there is a Covenant paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Father and the Son, for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Elect Sinners out of that Condition, and that by the Sufferings of the Mediator; And that by our betaking of our ſelves to Him, we may be fred from Sin and Wrath? Otherwayes, why did the Mediator come thus low; except it had been true, that man was under a Debt that he could not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>id the Father ſend His Son, except He had been really minded, that He ſhould offer Himſelf up a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifice to God for Mans Sin? And His accepting of the Satisfaction, tells plainly, that He was content, that the Cautioners Payment ſhould ſtand for the Principal Debtors: All this ſuppoſeth a Covenant, which is as real, as if we had ſeen, and had been Ear-witneſſes of the reading over of the Covenant in all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of it; we wiſh that many were come this length, as to be confirmed in the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Faith of the General Truths of the Goſpel, ſummed up in Chriſts Suffering<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; And there cannot be any ſerious R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e and End; if it be otherwiſe, we do but ſuperficially run over them. 2. As this ſhews the Lords Seriouſneſs in preſſing the offer of Redemption on Sinners, ſo it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you to be Serious in accepting of it, According to that in <hi>John</hi> 12. <hi>When I am lifted up, I will draw all men after m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When we ſay that Chriſt's Soul-travel calls for Faith; It requires this, and gives ground for it, That they that betake themſelves to Chriſt for Juſtification before God, may confidently commit themſelves to His guiding in all other things; For will He not be tender of them in theſe, when out of reſpect to them, when there was not a Covenant betwixt Him and them (though they were mentioned in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption) He laid down His Life, and Suffered ſuch things for them? May we not from this Reaſon, as the Apoſtle doeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>He that ſpared not his own ſon, but gave him to the death for us, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> Can there be a greater ground for Sinners that fear to give Him credit, to truſt Him with all things that concern them, then this? That He ſuffered ſo much for them. 4. Having betaken our ſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Him, it ſerves to confirm our Faith, and to bring us to the quieting of our ſelves in reſting on Him, and acquieſcing in Him; For what more could we require for ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In General, let me aſk, Is there not need that ye ſhould do ſo? Is there not Guilt, and hazard of Wrath, becauſe of Guilt? and if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Which ſure He would not have done, if Salvation could have been had another way. 2dly. And more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, As ye would conſider the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Grounds that He hath laid down for Faith to reſt upon, ſo ye would conſider the many Motives that ye have to preſs you to reſt on theſe Grounds, which we ſhall draw to theſe Four. 1. The Fulneſs and Sufficiency of the Ground that is given to Faith in Chriſts Sufferings, which the deeper they draw on His Soul, Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th hath the Fuller and Better Ground to make Uſe of them. 2. The Power and Ability that are Conſpicuouſly in Him, to make Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of His Purchaſe; He hath encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wrath and hath overcome; He is Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved and Juſtified before God, and <hi>is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to be a prince and a ſaviour, to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to Iſrael and remiſſion of ſins;</hi> And having Satisfied Juſtice, and defeated the Devil, and being thus exalted He can bring through, and land fate, ſuch Sinners as betake themſelves to Him; And theſe two, to wit, A ſufficient Price payed for the Debt of the Elect; And a ſufficient Prince and Saviour able to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt all that come unto God through Him, and who is Exalted, and ſitteth at God's Right Hand, to make Interceſſion for us, as they are a ſolid Ground for Faith to reſt on, ſo, a ſtrong Motive to preſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. 3.

Is the great Love of God, and of the Mediator, that eminently ſhined here, in their willingneſs to make the Application; As He is Faithfull, ſo is He willing to be imployed, and what greater evidence of Love would we have, then this, That Our Lord Jeſus hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted ſo much in the Salvation of Sinners, that He laid down His Life, and endured much more Soul travel for this very End? <hi>We beheld</hi> (ſayes <hi>John, Chap.</hi> 1.14) <hi>his glory, the glory as of the only begotten Son, of the Fatherfull of grace and truth;</hi> In His Humiliation, He was G orious in both theſe, Glorious in His Truth, making His Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to ſhine, in exact keeping of what was Aggreed upon, and Promiſed: Glorious in His Grace to poor Sinners, in making Application of His Purchaſe, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Fully; yea, the more that He was obſcured by His Humiliation, the more did His Grace ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And therefore, 2dly. May we not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulat with you, that are hearers of this Goſpel, and yet continue Strangers to Chriſt, that can hear of His Sufferings, and of His having been in an Agony for this very End, that Sinners might have a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to their Faith, and yet have never to this very hour Actually fled unto Him to find ſhelter? I know that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We ſhall ſpeak a Word to two Sorts. 1. To the Generality of Hearers, who are S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rangers to the right Uſe-making of Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe; And though ye may think this to be a hard Charge, and cannot well endure to be expoſtulated with as Unbelievers, yet let me aſk you. 1.
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:152256:189"/> Do ye think that all of you will go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? If not, but that it is a Truth, that the moſt part of the Hearers of the Goſpel will Periſh; Then, ſure all are not Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; for all Believers will go to Heaven, and not one of them ſhall Periſh, and though ye wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l not now believe this, The Day is coming, when ye ſhall, if Grace prevent not, ſee and find it; When Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers will be taken in with Chriſt, and others ſhut out; Many of you may think that this Doctrine is needleſs, The more needleſs that many of you think it to be, it is ſo much the more needfull, and uſeful to be inſiſted on with you. 2. If ye ſay ye have Faith, I aſk you, whence came it, and how got you it? I know, many of you will ſay, We believed alwayes, ſince we had underſtanding to know Good by Ill; yet, when ye are put to tell what it is, ye know not how to anſwer, nor can ye give the leaſt Satisfying Account of it; And yet ye queſtion not, but it will be well with you, and never once feared to go to Hell; And is that Faith think ye? Alace no, It's a plain Counterfit, and a very Cheat: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are ready to ſay, we believed not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, yet we believe ſometimes, to wit, when we do ſome Duties, and abſtain from groſs Evils; But when Challenges come, for the Neglect of Duties, and for the Commiſſion of Sins, we want it, and have nothing of it; And when Death comes, ſuch are forced to ſay, we fear we have been beguiling our ſelves; Whence comes this? But even from this Ground, that they would never ſuffer it to light, but they had Faith, which yet will never be accounted to be Faith, becauſe it hath not Chriſt's Righteouſneſs for the Ground of it, and therefore, when any Challenge is awakened it's a ſeeking, and quite gone; whereas True Faith will in ſome meaſure ſtand it out againſt a Challenge, and will abide the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yal of a Challenge, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs fled to. 3. We aſk you this Queſtion, Are ye ſure of your Faith? Ye will ſay, we hope ſo and believe ſo, and this is all ye can ſay which in effect comes to this, we Groundleſly preſumed ſo; And it's obſervable, That if ye be put to a Second Queſtion, What ground have ye for your Faith? ye have none at all; If ye be aſked, whether ye be certain, that ye are Believers, ye will anſwer, no body is certain, God knows that; Is not this ſtrange? And hath it not in it an utter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtancy? That Men and Women ſhould confidently aſſert, and maintain their Faith, and yet when they are put to prove it, they will tell you, that they are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and that none can be certain of it; Therefore, think it not ſtrange, that we expoſtulat with you, that ye have been ſo long hearing of Chriſt, and that yet ye have little, or rather, no Faith at all in the Uſe-making of His Righteouſneſs: But to make this the more convincingly clear, We ſhall give you four Characters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by True Faith may be tryed, and known, which will ſerve alſo to diſcover the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſs of the Faith of many. 1. It may be tryed by the Ground that it leaneth upon; ſolid Faith hath for the Ground of it Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, and Satisfaction, His Sufferings, the Price that He payed to Juſtice for Sinners Debt; That <hi>He who knew no ſin might become ſin for us,</hi> As it is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> Ye that ſay ye hope to come to Heaven, and will aſſert ſtrongly, that ye believe, Try it, I beſeech you by this, What is it that warrands you to believe, or, whereon is your Faith founded? Is it Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe that gives your Faith a Ground? ye will ſay, yes, And who do otherwayes? Are there any, but they expect Life through Chriſt? But deceive not your ſelves; There are many that have ſome ſort of reſpect to Chriſt, who do not at all rightly reſpect His Sufferings; many will look upon Chriſt as a Soveraigne, and as one that can pardon them their Sins, and will pray to Him for Pardon of them, who yet never ſeriouſly lay the weight of their obtaining Pardon on His Death, but expect Pardon immediately, without an interveening Satisfaction; Yea, they never look upon that as needfull: Others again, look only to Chriſt's ability to ſave, and will pray to Him as to an able Saviour; And here alſo by ſuch; His Righteouſneſs and Merit is ſhut out, as if it were ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:152256:189"/> and unneceſſary: A third ſort look to His mercy, and think that He is very K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd and Gracious, and that as one Man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives another, ſo will He forgive them; And do not Reſpect His Righteouſneſs, nor found their Faith and Expectation of Pardon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Him, as upon one that hath Satisfied Juſtice by the travel of His Soul, that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don might come to them, who come to Him: But where true Faith is, the Soul begins to look on it ſelf, as arraigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before the Tribunall of Juſtice, and libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as unable to pay its own Debt, Judges it ſelf, and hath not only ſome piece of exerciſe to be fred from a Challenge (which is all the Faith that many have) but hath ſerious exerciſe, how to have the Challenge anſwered, by betaking it ſelf to Chriſts Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; from theſe Grounds that a Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is given, that this Satisfaction is made Offer of in the Goſpel, and that the Soul is content to make uſe of it, and thereupon it draws the Concluſion anent Pardon: It hath interveening betwixt the Conſideration of its Guilt, and its Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Pardon, both the Covenant of Redemption on Gods ſide, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Reconciliation on the Sinners ſide, which the Soul doth eye, as that which gives it warrand to lay hold on Chriſt's Suffering; which the other who preſums, doth not; The Believing Soul ſayes, If this Satisfaction had not been, I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have expected mercy. 2. In the ſolid Faith of a Believer, there is, as an Uſe-making of Chriſt Crucified allenarly, as the meritorious Cauſe of Juſtification and Life, So he is exerciſed in this to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenarly ſettled on Him as ſuch; As for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Souls, as they find it eaſy to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſo they find it eaſie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and to reſt on Him only; but as the true Believer hath it for one Piece of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe to Him, how to win to Chriſt, ſo it's a Second Piece of Exerciſe to Him, to get Him reſted on only, and to get Him as Crucified, made the Ground of his Faith, As the Apoſtle inſinuates, when He ſayes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I determined to know nothing among you, but Chriſt Jeſus, and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> Where we have three Grounds of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, or Knowledge. 1. Jeſus Chriſt. 2. Him as Crucified. and 3. A determining to know no other thing, but Him to reſt upon for Life and Salvation; It's in this Reſpect that the Apoſtle, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. Doth count all things to be but loſs and dung and caſt, as it were, all over board, that he may w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Chriſt, and be found in Him: Many find it no difficult buſineſs to reſt on Chriſt only, and to keep out other things from being joyned with Him, and never once ſuſpect themſelves in this by any thing; But the Believer, (as I juſt now ſaid) hath here an Exerciſe and Difficulty to get Chriſt alone reſted on, ſo that nothing elſe be in the leaſt reſted on; Becauſe he knows nothing elſe to be a ſure Foundation, and becauſe he knows that it's natural to him to reſt on other things beſide Chriſt. 3. The true Believer is taken up, not only to have a ſure Ground to build on, but alſo to have his own Gripping at, and Building on that Ground made ſure; It's his exerciſe to have it out of queſtion, that his Faith is true Faith, and not Preſumption or Gueſſing; To have the Grace of Faith Actually and Really taking hold of, or apprehending Chriſt; Whereas another that preſumeth, and hath only an Opinion, or Conject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure in place of Faith; As he is in his own Opinion eaſily brought to Chriſt, ſo he finds it eaſy to exerciſe believing on Him; he will, it may be, grant, that he cannot Sanctifie the Sabbath-day, and yet he can believe, as if Believing, were leſs difficult then to Sanctifie the Sabbath; So, many will grant, that they cannot Pray, and therefore do decline Worſhipping of God, in their Families, who yet will confidently ſay that they can believe, and that they do believe alwayes, as if believing were leſſe difficult, then to Pray for a quarter, or half a quarter of an hour; But where ſolid Faith is, the exerciſe of it is a difficult thing, and the Perſon that hath it, hath a holy Jealouſy of it; And the experience of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, and of himſelf, ſometime tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that he may be miſtaken, he is often trying it, and doth not, nay, he dar not truſt much to it, and is put often with that Man ſpoken of, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. To cry, and ſometimes <hi>with tears, Lord I believe, help my unbelief;</hi> He dar not truſt much to his
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:152256:190"/> own Grip, and therefore hath recourſe to Chriſt to get it ſickered, and to have Him taking and keeping the Grip of his Grip, as it was with the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12.4. When Believers have betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Chriſt, they have a new Exerciſe, to know that it is ſo indeed; It's not only an Exerciſe to them how to Ground their Faith right, how to quite all other things, and to betake themſelves to Chriſt only, and to caſt their burden on Him; But it's an exerciſe to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE Bargain of Redemption is a great Bargain, and we may ſay, that it is a good Bargain, wherein the greateſt things that ever were imagined are tranſacted; The ſum whereof is in theſe two. 1. What ſhall be the Satisfaction, that muſt be given to the infinit Juſtice of God, or what ſhall be the amends that muſt be made to God for the Satisfying of His Juſtice, for the Sins of all the Elect?
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:152256:190"/> and that is compended in theſe Words, <hi>The travel of Chriſts ſoul,</hi> That is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or theſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What ſhall be the Satisfaction that the Mediator ſhall have for all His Sufferings, and Soul-travel? And this is ſummed up in theſe Words, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied,</hi> Upon which two ſtands the Covenant of Redemption; And hence it is, That all things relating to the Salvation of the Elect, are to ſicker and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Promiſes made to the Mediator, and it's two fold. 1. <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul,</hi> Which Words being an Explication of the former, and looking alſo to theſe which follow, there is a Word to be ſupplied, which will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>uit of the travel of his ſoul,</hi> That is, He cannot but have a Seed, and a numerous off-ſpring, becauſe of His Soul-travel, in bringing them Forth; and ſo the Promiſe in this reſpect ſhews the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the eff ct, that is, that He ſhall moſt certainly bring forth in H s travelling. The 2. Promiſe is, That He <hi>ſhall ſee</hi> the Fruit of His Soul-travel; or His Seed; It's much to have a Seed, but it's more to ſee it; it's not only this. That Chriſt ſhall have a numerous Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or to them, though by His Death He Purchaſe Life to them.</p>
            <p>We ſhall from the firſt Promiſe take <hi>two Obſervations,</hi> The 1. is this, That our Lord J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſus, by His Suffering and Soul trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, ſhall c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t,</hi> Where He compares His own Death, to the ſowing of Seed, which, when ſown doth rot? and then ſprings up, and hath Fruit, ſo (as if He had ſ id) my Death ſhall be a Seed, or Seed-time, whereon abundant Fruit ſhall follow for the Good and Salvation of many: This Doctrine ſuppoſes, 1. That our Lord Jeſus had a reſpect in the laying down of His Life, to the Salvation of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s own Elect People, or thus, that our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, in the laying down of His Life, had a deſigne and purpoſe to ſave the Elect; as often He ſaith, <hi>I lay down my life for my ſheep;</hi> And here, they are called a <hi>Seed,</hi> and <hi>Fruit,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>Juſtified</hi> in due time. 2. That this purpoſe ſhould by His Sufferings be certainly made effectual; this being the Fathers Promiſe to Him, <hi>He ſhall ſee His ſeed,</hi> or <hi>the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> It cannot be fruſtrated; And we may furder confirm it from theſe Grounds. 1 Becauſe it is a Covenanted, and Tranſacted buſineſs betwixt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, and is here Promiſed; If therefore there cannot be a failling of the Tranſaction and Bargain it muſt certainly have the full eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me to theſe ſweet Words uttered by Him on the Croſs, <hi>It is finiſhed;</hi> And therefore as I ſaid, the other part, That <hi>he ſhall ſee the fruit of his Soul-travel,</hi> muſt alſo be performed. 3. It's alſo clear from the End and Deſigne of the Covenant of Redemption, betwixt the Father and the Son, and of Chriſts laying
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:152256:191"/> down His Life, which was to bring about Life unto, and to make it forthcoming for all them that the Father had given Him, and to, and for no more, nor to, and for no fewer; Therefore He ſaith, <hi>All that the Father hath given me ſhall come unto me,</hi> And, <hi>I give them eternal life, and will raiſe them up at the laſt day;</hi> Now, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the End of the Covenant, and of Chriſts Death, and the mean whereby the Glory of Grace is manifeſted, that Life might not only be Purchaſed to the Elect, but alſo actually conferred on them, according to the Fathers and the Mediators deſigne in the Covenant; Chriſt Jeſus cannot but have the Promiſe made good unto Him, there being an engadgement of, and on the God-head (to ſpeak after the manner of Men) as to the Reality, Certainty and Succeſs of the performance, and for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out this Promiſe to the Mediator.</p>
            <p>The 1. <hi>Uſe</hi> Serves for Inſtructing and Clearing of us, in ſeveral things contravert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by unſound men; For, if this be a Truth, That our Lords Sufferings and Soul-travel cannot but have Fruit, and the Fruit that He aimed at therein, then, 1. There is a definit particular, and certain number Elected, to partake of the Benefit of Chriſt's Sufferings; becauſe there is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch a particular number that is given to Chriſt, to be Redeemed by Him, and that do actually partake of the Benefit of His Sufferings, which cannot fail. 2. That Chriſt's Sufferings are not intended as a Price and Satisfaction for the Sins of all and every one; for ſo He ſhould not ſee the Fruit of the Travel of His Soul, but ſhould in a great part miſs and loſs it, if He had intended, that the Travel of His Soul ſhould have been undergone for <hi>Judas,</hi> as well as for <hi>Peter.</hi> 3. There is here a Ground, for the Certainty, and Efficacy of the Grace of God in converting Elect Sinners, for Chriſt Jeſus cannot loſs theſe who are committed to Him to be Redeemed, more then He can loſs the Fruit of His Suffering, then ſure Faith is not left pendelous on Mans Free-will, but is put out of queſtion, as to all His own, through His undertaking, As He ſaith, That <hi>no man can come to me, except the Father draw him,</hi> ſo He ſaith, <hi>Theſe that are given me, ſhall</hi> and muſt <hi>come</hi> to me; There is a Put, or Powerful Draught of the Spirit of God, which is nothing elſe, but the efficacy of His Grace, by which this is made infruſtrably ſure, and not left contingent. 4. See here the Truth of the Perſeverence of Elect, and Regenerat Saints, who are appointed to be the Fruit of His Soul-travel, and a Satisfaction to Him for the ſame; For, if they ſhould fail, and not perſevere to the End, The Promiſe here made to the Mediator ſhould be caſt looſe, and not be neceſſarily performed, and fulfilled. 5. See here how the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Elect Sinners depends on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadgement betwixt God and the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>diator; Their Redemption depends on H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s paying of the Price, and their attaining the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it depends on God's ingadgement to the Mediator; Therefore we are ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>To be keeped by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation:</hi> It ſerves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to clear the Soveraignity of God, and the Freeneſſe of His Grace, when Sinners cannot pretend to have any hand in the Work, to mar the Beauty and Efficacy of Grace that ſhine therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. There is here, 1. ſomething for the incouragement of ſuch as would fain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt. And 2. Somewhat for Comfort to, and for Confirmation of them, who have betaken themſelves by Faith to Chriſt. 3. It ſerves withall, to incourage them, who would be at believing, and find difficulty in the way, while they are breathing after Him: It's certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that <hi>He ſhall have a ſeed,</hi> and <hi>ſhall ſee of the fruit of the travel of his ſoul,</hi> ſuch therefore may expect, that they ſhall come ſpeed, who would fain be at that which is the fulfilling of Gods ingadgement to the Mediator; for it was Tranſacted in the Covenant of Redemption, that His Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be for the good of Elect Sinners, and that the Father ſhould make Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of His Purchaſe made thereby to them; I ſay, 2dly. It ſerves to Comfort, Incour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and Confirm ſuch as are fled to Chriſt, and find their own difficulty, how to win through, for they haye a good Cautioner
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:152256:191"/> to make out their Faith, and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns their Salvation; Gods Promiſe to the Mediator ſhall not be for nought, nor in vain, but ſhall have it's accompliſhment; if poor ſinners were le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and theſe things in the Promiſes flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Covenant betwixt God and the Mediator, Sinners can have no Right
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:152256:192"/> to any thing that is Promiſed, but by a. Covenant, neither can they have any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to them, but through Chriſts Suffering 2. It's clear from the End of the Covenant that whatever Sinners have need of, they muſt be in Chriſts common for it; now, if we had Faith, or Repentance, or any other Grace from our ſelves, or on our own account, we ſhould not be in His Debt, and Common for all that we need, as indeed we are, according to that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 30, 31. <hi>He is made of God unto us, wiſdom,</hi> to be our Guide, and Teacher, <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> to be our Juſtifier, and the meritorious Cauſe of it, <hi>ſanctification,</hi> To be the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and the Procurer of it; and in a Word, compleat Redemption; and this is ſubjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the Reaſon of all, <hi>That he that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> or rejoyces, <hi>may glorie,</hi> or rejoyce <hi>in the Lord;</hi> that is, Whether there be a looking to Faith, or Repentance, or any other Grace, there may be no cauſe to be Vain or Proud of it, but that knowing theſe to be from Chriſt, and Fruits of His Purchaſe, all the praiſe of them may be to Him alone.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of this is large, it ſpeaks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more generally to them that are Strangers to Chriſt, and who think that they would be at Him; and ſomething to them that are in Him; and ſomething to both: And the 1. thing that it ſpeaks is this (which we have often heard of, but cannot hear of it too often,) Even the great and glad Tydings, and very good News, which we have to ſpeak of through Jeſus Chriſt, That Redemption is Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Him to poor Sinners, and that through Him there is acceſs to Life, and Peace, and Reconciliation with God, from which through Sin we had fallen, and run our ſelves, under a Forefaulture of, and from which we had been barred up Eternally except He had Suffered; There was a will of Separation, and Partition ſtanding betwixt God and us, which by His Sufferings was demoliſhed and broken down, and thereby a door of acceſs to God ſtruck up, even <hi>through the vail of his fleſh;</hi> Theſe ſhould be refreſhing and freſh Newes to us every day, as indeed they would be, if we rightly knew, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the benefit of God's Friendſhip, and what were our hazard, in lying ſtill in nature, and what was the Price that Chriſt laid down to Purchaſe for Sinners Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God, and delivery from His Curſe; that it behoved to coſt Him ſore Soul-travel, ere any ſpecial Grace could be beſtowed on Sinners; and that this ſame Goſpel that is Preached to you, is a Fruit of the Travel of His Soul; and that in making the Covenant of Redemption, this ſame was a part of the Indenture (to ſpeak ſo) That theſe good News might be Publiſhed in this ſame place, and theſe glad Tydings ſpoken of among you: And therefore 2. Put a greater Price on the Means that may furder your Salvation; on Repentance, Faith, Holineſs, Peace with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For they are the Fruits of a very dear Purchaſe, and the Reſults of a great and ſore Conflict, which the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator had with the Juſtice of God, ere there could be acceſs for a Sinner to any of them; There was not ſo much payed to get the World Created, as was payed to buy Faith, Repentance, Acceſs to God, and an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to Heaven, to Run-away Sinners: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was payed for the one, but a mighty great Price for the other: And therefore, 3. We would expoſtulat with many of you, How it comes to paſſe, that ye think ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of theſe things that Chriſt hath Purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ye think ſo little of Faith in Him; and that ſo many of you take a counterfit for it; try not if you have it; trouble not your ſelves though ye want it; and that other things of little value are much eſteemed of, and over-valued by you. Is there any thing comparable to that, which Chriſt hath put ſuch a Price on, that He gave His own Life for it, and that God hath put ſuch a Price on, that He promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to Chriſt, as a part of the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Travel of His Soul? And yet its lightly valued by many, yea, by moſt Men and Women; The day will come, when ye will think Faith to be of more value, and will think the Pardon of Sin, and an intereſt in Chriſt's Blood, to be valuable above the whole World, though
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:152256:192"/> ye had it, when ye ſhall be brought to reckon with God for the ſlighting thereof. And therefore 4ly. Seing this is a Truth, that every thing that leads to Life Eternal, is a Fruit of Chriſts Purchaſe, take the right way to attain it; The exhortation implyes theſe two, 1. That ye make a right choiſe of, and put a juſt value on theſe things, that ye ſhould chooſe and value. 2. That ye take the right way for attaining of theſe things. 1. Then, Would ye know what is to be valued and choſen? It's certainly theſe things, that God and the Mediator eſteem of, and that the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Firſt-born eſteem of; The things that Chriſt hath Purchaſed, and which are the Fruits of the Travel of His Soul, are moſt excellent; and therefore, Mind, Study, and Seek after theſe things, that may lead your Souls in to Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; ſeek after Faith, and Repentance, to have your peace made with God, to have the heart purified, to be of a meek and quiet Spirit, <hi>Which in the ſight of God are of great price,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks; to have Pardon of Sin, and Holineſs, for adorning the Goſpel of God, and to have Glory, that ye may ſee God and injoy Him; theſe things are the beſt things, this is undoubtedly <hi>the better part which will never be taken from them;</hi> Whoſe choiſe through Grace it is; God will give great Eſtates, Countries and Kingdoms in the World, to Men, to whom He will not give ſo much Faith as is like a grain of muſtard ſeed, nor a dram of true Holineſſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He thinks much leſs of the one then of the other, and becauſe the one is not ſo like God, nor will it have ſuch abiding Fruit as the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. What way may folk win to make this choice, and to attain theſe beſt and moſt valuable things? no other way, but that which this Doctrine holds out; If all things that lead to Life and Salvation be Fruits of Chriſts Purchaſe, then ſure it is by vertue of Chriſts Purchaſe alone, that ye muſt come by them, Pardon of Sin comes by the Blood of Sprinkling, Peace with God, Grace and more Grace, the exerciſe of Grace, and growth in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Faith in all its exerciſes and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and every other Grace, come by His Sufferings, as alſo doth Glory; becauſe He hath purchaſed theſe Graces of the Spirit, as well as Pardon of Sin, and Heaven: often Chriſt is miſken<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and paſſed by here; many think that they ſhall obtain Pardon of Sin, and go to Heaven without Him; others, though they will not own that, yet fail in the ſecond, and would make uſe of Him for Pardon of Sin, and for paying of their Debt, if they could Repent and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Him; but till they find theſe in themſelves, they ſcar to come unto Him whereas the Sinner that is convinced of Sin and of His hazard, would lay down this as the firſt ſtep of his way in coming to Chriſt, any Repentance and Believing, and the making of the heart willing to cloſe with, and to cleave to Him, is the Fruit of Chriſts Purchaſe, and I muſt be in His Common for it, for there is no other pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible way to get it; The firſt airth (to ſpeak ſo) that a wakened and ſenſible Sinner ſhould look unto, for Pardon and Peace, for Repentance, Faith, and all things, would be to Chriſt, and His Sufferings, whence all theſe come; Sinners at firſt are diſpoſed to take too far a look, and ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the order of things, Therefore, when the ſenſe of Sin pinches them, and they ſet about to believe, and find that their hearts are very averſe from believing, and can hardly be brought to it, then they are fainted, when they conſider, and find that, if it ſtood but on this, even to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to take Chriſt, they cannot do it, but then, and in that caſe, the Lord minds, that they ſhould be much in His Common for Faith, and Repentance, and for a ſoft and tender Heart, and that they ſhould ſeek theſe from Him, as well as Pardon of Sin, conſidering, that all this is Chriſt's Purchaſe; and that there is a poſſibility to win to it this way, when they can win to it no other way; If ye would take this way, even to eye and look to Chriſt as the Author, and Finiſher of Faith, and be in His Common for it, through His Grace it ſhould go better with you; This is it which the Apoſtle hath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.

Is it not a Fruit of Chriſts Purchaſe? and will ye be Vain, or Conceity of that which is the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of another?

            <p>AS it is a moſt wonderfull Work that Our Lord Jeſus hath in hand, and a mighty great Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that coſt Him the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of His Soul; So it may be thought, that it muſt be a very great Price that Our Lord Jeſus hath to expect, as His Satisfaction for all that ſore Labour and Travel; This is it that the Text holds forth, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the fruit of the travel of his ſoul;</hi> Which in Sum is this, He ſhall ſee poor Sinners getting good of Him, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by His Grace, and admitted to friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:152256:194"/> with God, and that to His Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Words following clear, <hi>He ſhall be ſatisfied,</hi> to wit, as to that Fruit, and ſhall acquieſce in it, as His Satisfaction for all the Travel of His Soul.</p>
            <p>We told you, that there were three things in theſe Words, 1. The Price that is called for from the Mediator, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Work of Redemption, and making Reconciliation betwixt God and Sinners, to wit, <hi>The travel of his ſoul,</hi> The ſad and ſorely pinching Straits, and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that He was put to, and brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not only in His Body, but alſo in His Soul. 2. The Promiſe made to Him upon His undertaking, and paying of the Price, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul,</hi> That is, the Fruits and Effects of His Soul travel; It ſhall not be for nought, but ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have Fruit, He ſhall have a numerous Seed and Iſſue. 3. There is here holden forth the Mediators acquieſcence in the Bargain ſo propoſed, That He undertaking the Condition of laying down His Life, on theſe ſame Terms, that He ſhall ſee a Seed, He requires no other Satisfaction, and therefore He accepts of it, and acquieſces in it, as the Reſult of this Deſigne, <hi>and ſhal be ſatisfyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſpoken of the former <hi>Two,</hi> We come now to ſpeak of the <hi>Third,</hi> And we may conſider it, in theſe three Reſpects. 1. As it looks to Chriſt's Deſigne, Who is like to one that is running a Race, and hath the Prize before him, and in his eye; and this is implyed here, That He hath ſomething before Him, in laying down of His Life, which He ſhall not miſs, but ſhall reach and be Satisfied in it; ſo many are given Him, for whom He enters Cautioner, on Condition, that His Righteouſneſs ſhall be made furthcoming to them, and that none of them ſhall be without, or want it. 2. As it looks both to the number, and certainty of the Effects, and Fruits in reſpect of them that are given to Him; <hi>He ſhall be ſatisfied,</hi> He ſhall have, though not all Men and Women, yet a ſufficient number, even as many as ſhall ſatisfie and content Him, And whatever was intended by Him, in the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of His Life, He ſhall want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, but ſhall be ſatisfyed in it; and thus the Words are to be Actively underſtood, to wit, of Gods Actual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of that which ſhall be Satisfying to the Mediator. 3. It may be looked on as the Effect and Conſequent following upon the former Promiſe; and ſo it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood Paſſively for the delight that He takes in the Fruit of His Sufferings, and in the ſeing of Sinners getting the good of them; and the ſo meaning is, That He ſhall be fully contented, and throughly well Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with, yea, even delighted, and (to ſpeak ſo) comforted in this, for all the Travel of His Soul, when many ſhall be brought to believe in Him, and to get good of Him.</p>
            <p>To clear it furder, We may take the Words as alluding to ſeverall Similitudes, As, 1. To that of hungry and thirſty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are ſaid to be ſatisfied, when their hunger and thirſt are removed, by meat and drink; which implyes, That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in His purſuing and performing the Work of Redemption, had a Holy Hunger and Thirſt, and this His Hunger and Thirſt Is Satisfyed in their Salvation, and what leadeth to it; As Himſelf ſaith. <hi>John</hi> 4.32. (Where He makes uſe of this ſame Similitude) <hi>I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</hi> 2. It may allude to a Man's taking pains in planting of an Vine-yard, or Orchard, to whom it is a Satisfaction when all the Trees grow, thrive well, and bear Fruit; and ſo the meaning is, That Our Lord Jeſus ſhall be at vaſt Expence, and great Labour and Pains, in making Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to become <hi>Trees of righteouſneſs,</hi> but that all theſe for whom He Suffered, and was at all this Expence and Pain ſhall hold ſo well, and be ſo Fruitfull at length, that He ſhall be fully Satisfied in them, and think all well beſtowed; Or, 3. We may take it in alluſion to a Woman in Travel, who is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 16.21. <hi>To have ſorrow, while her pains are upon her, but ſo ſoon as ſhe is delivered, ſhe no more remembers her ſorrow, for joy that a man child is born;</hi> And this Similitude is here eſpecially alluded unto, therefore Our Lords Sufferings are called <hi>Travel,</hi> becauſe of the Pains that He was put unto in them, and becauſe the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:152256:194"/> End of them was to bring forth Children, before called <hi>His ſeed;</hi> As if the Prophet had ſaid, Our Lord Jeſus ſhall be put to great Sorrow in Suffering, but He ſhall bring forth; And as a Woman hath Joy in the Man-child brought forth, ſo ſhall He have more comfort and delight in the bringing forth of Believers, then He had ſorrow in the procuring of Life to them, though that was very great.</p>
            <p>From the Words thus conſidered and explained, take theſe <hi>two Obſervations,</hi> 1. That Our Lord Jeſus is exceedingly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſatisfyed, and well-pleaſed with poor Sinners, making uſe, and getting good of His Sufferings; It's a thing moſt Satisfying, and Well-pleaſing to Him. 2. That ſeing Our Lord Jeſus is ſo well-pleaſed with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners making uſe of Him, there is all equity and reaſon for it, that He ſhould have this Satisfaction; and this follows not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the former, but clearly riſeth from the Words; For this Satisfaction is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Him for His Soul-travel; and as it's Juſt, that they that Labour ſhould partake of their Labour, and that the Hirling ſhould have his hire, ſo, it's not only Satisfying to Chriſt, that Sinners get good of Him, but it's Juſt, He having Purchaſed it at ſo dear a Rate.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt of theſe, That Our Lord Jeſus is exceedingly delighted and ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Sinners making uſe, and getting good of Him; If there were no other Scripture to confirm it, this ſame is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; Would ye then know what Chriſt aims at in His Sufferings, what will content and ſatisfie Him, as a Recompence for all His Soul-travel? It's even this, To <hi>ſee the of fruit of the travel of his ſoul,</hi> To have Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners getting good of Him, and ſaved by Him, and there is nothing but this that will Satisfye Him; It were a great matter to have the Faith of this Settled, and Rooted in our Hearts; if we could rightly take up what He hath Suffered, how low He hath condeſcended to come, even to be a Man, and a <hi>Man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief,</hi> To be reproached and mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to take on Him the Curſe, and to be in Pain and Soul-travel; And then if we could rightly take up what He aimed at, and deſigned in all this, and what He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be a recompence to Him for it all; even this, That when His Goſpel is Preached, ſuch and ſuch poor Sinners under hazard of Wrath and Challenges for Sin, ſhould, through cloſing with Him, be brought to anſwer all their Challenges by this; Our Lord Jeſus hath ſatisfied Juſtice for Sinners; and when poor Sinners are under the ſenſe of a hard heart, that they ſhould caſt their Eye on the ſame ground for a remedy of that Spiritual Malady, and Plague, even His Sufferings, which have purchaſed the mollifying of the heart, as well as Juſtification, and Pardon of Sin; And when a Sinner is diſconſolat, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, becauſe of Sin, and Divine Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure that He ſhould be Cheered and Comforted in His Sufferings; This, even this is refreſhing, and is delightſome to Him: We ſay, it were much to get this throughly believed; That Sinners are not half ſo fain to come in under His Sufferings for ſhelter and refreſhing, as Our Lord Jeſus is, (to ſpeak with reverence) to ſee them Sheltered, Refreſhed, and Thriving; The very mentioning of this ought to be <hi>as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to the bones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for furder clearing of it, we would ſpeak a Word. 1. To what this Delight, and Satisfaction is, 2. To ſome grounds to confirm the truth of it, that Our Lord Jeſus is indeed delighted to ſee poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners coming to Him, and getting good of Him</p>
            <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> of theſe, We did, when we was ſpeaking of theſe Words, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>The pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand,</hi> Shew, how it was a delightſome thing to Jehovah; And now ſpeaking of it from this 11. <hi>v.</hi> in reference to the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, we ſhall take it up in theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. 1. There is in Our Lord Jeſus, not only a delight in Sinners getting good of Him, as it is a thing He calls for, and is agreeable to His revealed will, and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required of them as their Duty, in which reſpect it's acceptable to God, and cannot but be acceptable and well-pleaſing to Him; neither, 2. Is this delight only
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:152256:195"/> in reſpect of the End of His Sufferings, which were undergone to make a way for, and to ſtrick open a Door to the Throne of Grace, through the Vail which is His Fleſh; that poor Sinners might come to a Fountain and waſh, and have acceſs to God through Him; Which being the End He had before Him in His Death, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be acceptable to God, becauſe it was His End in the giving of His Son to Die; and ſo it's delightſome to the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; but alſo 3dly. It is ſo in theſe two reſpects further; Sinners coming to Him, reſting on Him, and getting good of Him, is His delight. 1. In reſpect of the Honour that is done unto Him; when a Sinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves on Him, He counts it the putting of the Crown on His Head, As it is <hi>Cant.</hi> 3 11. ſee alſo to this purpoſe, <hi>John</hi> 5.23, 24. And though there could have been a poſſibility of honouring of God before, yet there is no Honouring of the Mediator, till Folk make uſe of His Sufferings by Faith; And it is on this ground that Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains when He is not made uſe of; and therefore, when Sinners give Him credit, by committing the ſaving of their Souls to Him, and by making uſe of His Offices for that End, and for His performing in them that wherefore they were appointed, it cannot but be acceptable and well-pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Him. 2. In reſpect of that Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that Our Lord Jeſus hath with His own Members; For though the Mediator be now glorified in H aven, yet He hath a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne Heart, and affection ſtill, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably glorious, and ſo a kindly Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie with them, and is ſome way affected with both their good and their ill; And conſidering Him thus, He hath a delight in the good and well-fare of His People, and their being delighted in, and ſatisfied with Him, proves a Delight and Satisfaction to Him.</p>
            <p>For the next thing, to wit, the clearing and confirming of it; It might be cleared and confirmed from many Grounds, but we ſhall only touch on ſome, that may make it out moſt convincingly, that it's moſt delightſome to Jeſus Chriſt, to ſee Sinners making uſe of Him, and getting good of His Sufferings; And this His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light may be drawn from Eternity, and carried on to Eternity, 1. In the making of the Covenant of Redemption, it was delightſome to Him to enter in it, As is clear <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>I delight to do thy will, O my God;</hi> The Bargain was no ſooner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed (if we may ſpeak ſo to that which is Eternal) But heartily it was cloſed with by Him; And this is confirmed, <hi>Prov</hi> 8.32. Where the Subſtantial Wiſdom of the Father is brought in, ſaying, <hi>Then I was by him as one brought up with him, and I was dayly his delight, rejoycing in the habitable parts of his earth, and my delights were with the Sons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f men;</hi> Our Lord Jeſus, before the World began, was delighted in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought that ſuch a thing was a coming, that in ſuch and ſuch parts of the World, ſuch and ſuch poor Sinners ſhould be called by His Grace, and get the good of His Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fufferings; As a Man in a long Journey, or Voyage, may be delighted in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fight of the End of it, before He come at it. 2.

               </gap>o a poor ſinfull Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and when the Diſciples would fain have refreſhed Him with that which they had bought, He ſayes to them, <hi>I have meat to eat that ye know not of,</hi> And when they begin to wonder what that could be, He ſayes further to them, <hi>It is my meat to do my Fathers will, and to finiſh his work,</hi> And what was that, a poor whotiſh Woman is ſpoken to, by Him, and brought by His ſpeaking to acknowledge Him to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and to accept of Him as ſuch; And by that bleſſed Work, His Hunger and Thirſt were Satisfied: So <hi>Luke</hi> 22.15. He ſaith to His Diſciples, <hi>with deſire have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to eat this paſſover with you, before I ſuffer:</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 12.50. <hi>I have a baptiſme to be baptized with, and how am I ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed?</hi> Though he drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Cup was terrible to Him, and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:152256:195"/> though mockings and reproaches were not pleaſant in themſelves, yet the love that He had to Sinners good, maſtered all the bitterneſs that was in theſe, and made them ſweet. 3. There is nothing that He more complains of, nothing angers and grieves Him more, then when He is not made uſe of, <hi>Ye will not</hi> (ſaith He, <hi>John</hi> 5.) <hi>come to me, that ye may have life,</hi> To ſhew, that the beſt inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ainment that they could give Him, was, to come and get Life from Him; And it's told us, that <hi>He was angry and grieved for the peoples unbelief, and hardneſs of heart;</hi> Yea, He <hi>weeps</hi> over them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. All which prove the great delight that He had, and hath ſtill, in Sinners getting good of Him; And frequently in the <hi>Song,</hi> as <hi>Chap.</hi> 2, and 6. <hi>He is ſaid to feed among the lillies;</hi> There is all His intertainment that He gets in the World, He feaſts only on the Fruits of His own Spirit in them that welcome Him: I ſhall name but one place more, and that is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.10.11. <hi>He delights not in the ſtrength of a horſe, nor in the legs of a man, but in them that fear him;</hi> The following Words clear it more, what it is that delights Him, <hi>In them that hope in his mercy,</hi> that is, in them that draw into Him by believing, He delights in theſe, Beyond all the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 1. It were a deſirable thing to be believing this; Are there any ſo prophane, but are ready to think, that if they knew what would pleaſe God, or Chriſt, they would do it? The Queſtion is here anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this is pleaſing, and only pleaſing to Him; If this be wanting, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that will pleaſe Him, even that ye make uſe of Chriſts Sufferings, and imploy Him in His Offices, for getting the good that may be had by them; This is it that ye are c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of His Sufferings; and in this reſpect, the more hardly a Sinner is put at, it is the more ſatisfaction to Him, that He in His
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:152256:196"/> Death and Sufferings be made uſe of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this way, the Sinners Life is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely the benefit of His Sufferings; and that ſuch a Perſon hath any Strength, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or Peace, and is admitted to Heaven, It is allenarly through the Travel of His Soul, which is His great Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>And therefore, we would, 2dly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you, That as you would do Chriſt a favour, (to ſpeak ſo with rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; And, O! what a motive is this for vile Sinners, the duſt of His Feet, to be put in a capacity to do Him a pleaſure) Endeavour this eſpecially, that as to you, Chriſt may ſee the Fruit of the Travel of His Soul, and be ſatisfied, and that all His kindneſs offered to you may not be Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; This is the great hing of the Goſpel, as to that which is preſſed upon you, and this is the wonderfull motive that is given to preſſe it, That it's delightſome to Chriſt, and therefore ye ſhould believe on Him: It were incouragement enough that it's profitable to your ſelves; But if ye had hearts of ſtone this ſhould move you to it, That Our Lord Jeſus ſeeks no more Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from you for all His Soul-travel, but that ye make uſe of His Sufferings, that ye do not receive this Offer of His Grace in vain, nor be Fruitleſs under it: In a word, we have here laid before us (and think upon it) the moſt Wonderfull, Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, and Inexpreſſible Sute and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Him who is the Creator, to us poor ſinfull creatures, and what is it? I have been (ſayes He on the matter) in ſore Travel and Pain for you, now I pray you let it not be for nought, let me ſee the Fruit of it; And (to ſpeak it with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Majeſty of God) It would ſay this to you, let not Our Lord Jeſus rue of His Sufferings; for as many as hear of this Offer, and do not credit Him with their Souls, they do what they can, to make Him repent that ever He became Man, and Suffered ſo much, when He is thus ſhifted, and unkindly requited by them, to whom He makes the Offer; and this is very home and urgent, preſſing of the neceſſity of making uſe of Him, when ſuch an Argument is made uſe of, for thus it ſtands with you, and His Offer ſpeaks this; Either make uſe of Chriſt, and of His Soul-travel, for ſaving of your Souls, that ſo He may be ſatisfied; or, if ye ſlight Him, ye not only deſtroy, and cauſe to periſh your own Souls, but ye refuſe to Satisfie Chirſt for His Soul-travel, and do what in you lyes to marr, and defeat the End and Deſigne of His Sufferings; and is not this a great and ſtrongly puſhing <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma?</hi> The reſult of your receiving, or rejecting of Chriſt will be this, if ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Him, ye ſatisfie Him, if ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Him, ye ſay ye are not content that He ſhould be ſatisfied; and what can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to come of it, when Chriſt Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much, and when all that was craved of you, was to make uſe of Him, and when it was told that, that would ſatisfie Him, and yet that was refuſed? What a horrible challenge will this be in the Great Day? And therefore to preſſe this <hi>Uſe</hi> a little, we ſhall ſhew you here, 1. What it is that we exhort you to, And 2. What is the force of this Motive, 1. We would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you in general, that ye would endeavour the Salvation of your own Souls, This is it, He cryes to you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22. <hi>How long ye ſimple ones will ye love ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ye ſcorners delight in ſcorning, turn ye at my reproof,</hi> &amp;c. He aims at this, that ye ſhould get your Souls ſaved from Wrath, and this ſhould not be prejudicial, nor at the long run unſatisfying to your ſelves, and it will be very ſatisfying to Him. 2. It is not only to aim at Salvation ſimply, but to aim at it by Him, to aim at Pardon of Sin, and Juſtification through His Righteouſneſſe and Satisfaction; And that ye would bring no other Argument before God to plead upon, for your Peace with Him, but this; and that ye would aim at Holineſſe, as a Fruit of His Death, <hi>He hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purchaſed a peculiar people to himſelf to be zealous of good works,</hi> As it is, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. And that ye would aim to do holy Duties, by His ſtrengthning of you; and that ye would live by Faith in Him, which is <hi>your victory over the world,</hi> and the very Soul of the practice of all holy Duties; And 3. That ye aim to have a Comfortable, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhfull,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:152256:196"/> and Chearfull Life in Him, and by what is in Him, as if it were your own, it being legally yours by Faith in Him; To be ſtoping your own mouth, as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in your ſelves to boaſt of, and, (as I juſt now ſaid) to be chearing and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelves from that which is in Him, And as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. Even to be <hi>hoping in his mercy;</hi> In a word, It is to be ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace with God through Him, to be ſtudying Holineſs in His ſtrength, and to be ſtudying a Comfortable and Chearfull walk through the grounds of joy that are given you in Him, which is very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; would ye then do Him a favour, and have Him Delighted and Satisfied, do but this, give Him your Souls to be ſaved by Him, in His own way; come to Him ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of Sin, and founding your Peace on Him, though weak in your ſelves, yet ſtrong in Him, <hi>On whom</hi> as <hi>the mighty one God hath laid help;</hi> And ſtudying holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in His ſtrength; drawing vertue from Him, only to moritify your luſts; That it may be known that Chriſt hath died, and is Riſen again, becauſe Grace ſhines in ſuch a Perſon; And be Comforted in Him, <hi>He that glories, let him glorie in the Lord,</hi> having given up with Creature-comforts, and Confidences, with your own Gifts, Parts, Duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And having betaken your ſelves to the Peace, Strength and Conſolation that are in a Mediator, and which run through the Covenant of Grace, and flow forth from Him, as the Fountain from whom all the Grace, and Comfort that come to us are derived. 2dly. For the force of the Motive, conſider ſeriouſly, if this be not a pinching ſtrait that ye are put to; if this be it wherein Our Lords Satisfaction lyes, and wherein the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Edification of your own Souls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; we poſe you, if it be any great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, or unreaſonable thing, that is called for from you? and if the Motive whereon it is preſt be not moſt juſt and reaſonable? that theſe who have, or profeſs to have the Faith of this, that it will be Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Him for all His Soul-travel, that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners make uſe of Him, ſhould yeeld it to Him; And whether in the Day of the Lord it will not be a moſt hainous, ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and abominable Guilt, that when the buſineſs of your own Salvation ſtood on this, even on your Satisfying of Chriſt by yeelding, ye refuſed, diſdained and ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and would not make uſe of Him for your Peace, and would no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in His ſtrength ſtudy Holineſs, though your own Souls ſhould never be ſaved, nor He ſatisfied or His Soul-travel; This, of all other Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges will be the ſharpeſt, and moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and upon the other hand, it may be moſt comforting to a poor bodie that is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of Sin, and afraid of Wrath; is there or can there be hazard to do Chriſt a pleaſure by believing on Him? It's a thing delightſome to Him, and therefore, let this be one great Motive to preſs believing in Chriſt, among the reſt, which, though it be croſs, and thwarting to the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, and may look like preſumption to look a Promiſe in the Face, and to offer to make application of it to the poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſelf; Yet ſeing it's a thing ſo pleaſing to Chriſt, that it ſatisfies Him for all His Sufferings, eſſay it upon this very account, remembring alwayes, that <hi>He delights in them that hope in his mercy; and to him be praiſe, for ever.</hi>

            <p>We propoſed this, as the main <hi>Doctrine</hi> from the Words the laſt day, That it is great Satisfaction to Our Lord Jeſus, to ſee Sinners making uſe of, and getting good of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> 2. If this be Chriſt's Satisfaction for all the Travel of his Soul, that he ſee Sinners getting good of his Sufferings, Then, if any Motive be weighty to move People to give Him their So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls to ſave, this muſt ſure have weight with them, even that thereby he may have Satisfaction for all his Soul-travel; And therefore we
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:152256:198"/> would exhort you on this ground, to give Him your Souls to be ſaved by Him, in order to His Satisfaction: And what is ſpoken in common, take it as ſpoken to every one of you in particular, Men and Women, Old and Young, Rich and Poor; If ye would do Chriſt a favour, and pleaſure, give Him imployment for Pardon of Sin, for Peace with God, for Sanctification, for Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for Acceſs to Heaven; Or, if ye would know what motive we would uſe to perſwade you to make Uſe of this Goſpel for all theſe, take this for one, and a main one, That it will Satisfie, and even (to ſpeak ſo with Reverence) comfort Chriſt for all the Travel of His Soul, and for all the hard Labour that He endured; even as it Satisfies a wooer for all his Pains and Patience, in waiting on after many refuſals and ſlights, when he gains the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Conſent, and when the Match is made up; So it will Satisfie Him, when He ſees Souls, by vertue of His Sufferings, brought to believe on Him, and to lay the weight of their Salvation upon Him, for then He ſees it was not for nought that He laid down His Life; And truly if this Motive prevail not, I know not what Motive will prevail.</p>
            <p>But to make it the more clear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, conſider theſe things, 1. What it is that Chriſt ſeeks, when He ſeeks Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the Travel of His Soul, He even ſeeks your benefit, and good; If He had ſought that which would have been painfull to you, ye would, I ſuppoſe, have judged your ſelves obliged readily to have gone about it, had it been (as we uſe to ſpeak) to have gone through the fire for Him; But now, when this is all that He ſeeks, that by making uſe of His Sufferings ye may be Juſtified, made Holy, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your Life, and brought to Heaven at your Death, ſhould it not much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage you to give Him this Satisfaction? 2. Who ſeeks this Satisfaction, and to whom is it to be given? Is it not to Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? There is very great weight in this Part of the Argument, that by believing on Him, and making uſe of His Sufferings, we not only ſatisfie and ſave our ſelves, but make Glad the heart of Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as God, needs no Satisfaction, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is capable of any Additional Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Creatures. He being infinitely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and fully Satisfied in the injoyment of His own All ſufficient Self; Nothing from without can be added unto Him; yet He hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condeſcended to become Man, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator betwixt God and Man, to reconcile loſt Sinners to God, He is graciouſly pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to account it Satisfaction to Him for all His Soul-travel, to have Sinners making uſe of Him for their good; and if their be any weight in the Satisfaction of one that is Great and Good, and good to us, This hath weight in it, that our doing ſo, will ſatisfie Him, that is Matchleſly Great and Good, and ſuperlatively ſo to Sinners. 3. Conſider the Ground on which this Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is pleaded for, and it will add yet more weight to this Argument; it's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Him for His <hi>Soul-travel;</hi> And can any find in their hearts to think, but He ſhould be Satisfied on this account? Is there not reaſon for it? <hi>Who</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſayes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7.) <hi>goeth a ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare on his own charges? who plants a vineyard and eats not of the fruit thereof? or, who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</hi> Ah! Should Our Lord Jeſus beſtow all this Labour and Pains for nothing? And further, 4ly. Whoſe Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is it that is ſought? (This conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is ſomewhat diverſified from the 2. And would not therefore be looked on as any Tautology,) is it not His who is Lord of all, and who will one day be Judge? When, if we had all the World would give it to pleaſe Him; And who will pronunce the Sweeteſt or the Sadeſt Sentence upon us, according as we have Satisfied Him in this, or not; Conſidering that it is He who deſires this ſatisfaction from us, ſhould there not be an holy Diligence, Eggerneſs, and Zeal to get that performed, that will Pleaſe and Satisfie Him? Eſpecially when the improving of His Sufferings may do it? But 5ly. From whom requires He this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction? Is it not from them, who like ſheep have gone aſtray? From theſe who have many iniquities lying on them, and
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:152256:198"/> are lying under the Curſe of God by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? From theſe, who muſt either be healed by His Strips, or elſe they will never be healed, but will die of their Wounds? may not this make the Argument yet the more ſtrong, that He is not ſeeking this Satisfaction of ſtrangers, but of His own People, nor of Righteous Folks, but of Sinners, who are lying under the Curſe, and whoſe happineſs lyes in giving Him this Satisfaction? And when it is thus with you, That either your Sins muſt be taken away by Him, or elſe ye muſt lye under them for ever; That either He muſt bear the Curſe for you, or ye muſt bear it your ſelves; If theſe things be obvious, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are, O! give Him the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that He calls for, and let Him not be put to ſay, as it is, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.4. <hi>I have laboured in vain, and ſpent my strength for nought, and in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. To preſs this yet a little more (Although it ſhould be ſad to us, that there ſhould be need to preſs that ſo much on us, which is ſo profitable to us, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying to Him) even that we would make uſe of Him, for our Spiritual Good and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; Theſe conſiderations will add weight to the Argument. 1. What eſteem Chriſt hath of it; He thinks it as it were to be Payment, and a ſort of Compenſation for all His Labour and Sufferings; The Price was not Gold nor Silver, nor any ſuch thing, which He gave for Sinners, but it was His Precious Blood, His own Life, who was the Prince of Life, and the Prince of the kings of the Earth; And O! what a vaſt and infinit diſproportion is there betwixt His Life, and all our Lives; and yet He accounts it a ſufficient Reward, if we will but give Him our Souls to be ſaved by Him, in His own way, and will make Uſe of His Death and Sufferings for that End; And if it were poſſible, that we could think little of our own Salvation, and much of Chriſt's Satisfaction for His Soul-travel, ought we not to think much of our own Salvation, in reference to His Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; And now, when he hath joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe together, ſo that we cannot pleaſe, nor ſatisfie Him, except we give Him our Souls to ſave, and cannot ſatisfie Him but that in doing ſo, our Souls ſhall be ſaved; Should it not induce us to make Uſe of Him for that End? If He had commanded us to run here and there, and to undergo ſome long and very toilſome Voyage, or ſome hard piece of Labour, or to beſtow of our Means and Subſtance, yea, all of it to pleaſe Him, it had been very reaſonable on His part to have demanded it, and moſt unreaſonable on ours to have refuſed it, But our Lord layes weight on none of theſe things, as ſeperated from the laying the weight of our Souls on His Righteouſneſs; The Reaſon is, becauſe the making uſe of His Righteouſneſs, and the improving of His Sufferings for our Juſtification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſhews, that He in His Sufferings is eſteemed of, and He ſeeks no more but that. 2. Conſider how good reaſon ye have to ſatisfie Chriſt, and yeeld to Him, and to improve His Sufferings for your own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; Is there any that dar ſay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? Will not Hiſtorical Faith ſay that there is good reaſon for it? if there be any Love to Him, or to your own Souls, will it not plead for this? If ever ye think to be Pardoned, is there any other name given whereby ye can expect it? Is there any Holineſs, or Comfort but from Him, any hope of Heaven, but through Him? and will not this bind the Conſcience of any that is not deſperat, to judge, That He from whom all this comes ſhould be Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? 3. Conſider at what a rate He hath Purchaſed theſe benefits of the Pardon of Sin, of Peace with God, of Sanctification, of the hope of Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And how He hath brought them about; Did He not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the Covenant of Redemption, and hath He not performed all that He ingag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for? in taking on our Nature, in being in an Agony, in Sweating drops of Blood, in being Buffeted, Mocked, Reproached, and in Dying, to procure Life and Peace to Sinners? If we could rightly diſcern His Sufferings, and the benefits that we have by them, it would ſay, that there is good reaſon, that He ſhould have a kindly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who hath done, and Suffered ſo much to obtain theſe to us. 4. Conſider the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:152256:199"/> cheerfull way of His Suffering, and of His laying down of the Price, how well-pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed He was to undergo all for His People, ſo that He ſayeth, <hi>John</hi> 10. <hi>No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf, and take it up again; Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>I delight to do thy will, O my God;</hi> And, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. <hi>I have a baptizme to be baptized with, and how am I ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed?</hi> And, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. <hi>With deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e have I deſired to eat this paſsover before I ſuffer: He opened not his mouth,</hi> in order to His delivery ſo well did He love the Salvation of Sinners: Now, What if a meer and ordinary M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n had done ſomething to the hazard of His Life, for you, would it not plead with the moſt Carnal Perſons, having the leaſt meaſure of Natural, or Moral Inginuity to give Him a meeting; Very Heathens will love theſe that love them, much more ought ye to ſatisfie Him in what He requires, who h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th done ſo much for Sinners. 5. Conſider what He ſeeks as a Satisfaction, (hinted at before) If it were a great matter, or which were to your prejudice, there might be ſome ſhadow of a ground to Refuſe, but when it is no more but to make uſe of His Sufferings, for your own good, how can it be refuſed? It's in this Caſe, as if the Patients health would ſati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fie the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, as if a Poor Mans receiving of a Sum of Money would ſatisfie the Rich Friend, who is pleaſed to beſtow it; Or, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s if one that is naked would ſatisfie another, by putting on the Cloaths laid to his hand by him; What reaſon is there to refuſe ſuch Offers? And yet this that Chriſt calls for, is, even as if the Phyſician ſhould ſay to his dying Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

Conſider, if Jeſus Chriſt get not this Satisfaction, what will come of it, if ye pleaſe Him not in this, He will be highly diſpleaſed, no other thing will Satifie Him, though ye ſhould Pray and Weep an hundred years, and do many good Works, if He get not this Fruit of His Soul-ſufferings, To wit, that ye im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them for your Souls good and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, He will be continually diſpleaſed; Therefore it's ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Kiſs the Son, leaſt he be angry;</hi> And that is not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:152256:199"/> to all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead;</hi> He would have Judged the World though Chriſt had not come; But He will have a day wherein He will call all the hearers of the Goſpel to an account, eſpecially as to this, To wit, What wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come they have given to Chriſt: And ſeing ſuch a day is coming, when Folk will be called to an account, what Uſe they made of Him, with what face will many come before Him, when it ſhall be told them, That He craved no more Satisfaction from them, for all that He Suffered, but that they would have improved His Sufferings for their own good, and that yet they would not give Him that much? Doeth not this ſay, that their is need, that we ſhould look well what Fruit there is of His Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that there may be more then if He had not Suffered at all. 9. Conſider the great weight that will be laid on this Sin, of refuſing to believe, and to Satisfy Him in this, to wit, in improving of His Sufferings, above all other Sins; This is a Sin that will be found to be againſt Equity, Thankfullneſſe, and Ingenuity, that when He had done and Suffered ſo much, He was ſo ill requited; Yea, it will be found to be a wilfull and malicious Sin, That, when your Good and His Satisfaction were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, ye would rather choiſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy your ſelves, then to Satisfie Him, in ſaving your ſelves, through Uſe-making of His Sufferings: There are two remarkable Words to this purpoſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. In the 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> it's ſaid of ſuch, That <hi>they cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame;</hi> That is, they do diſpleaſe and anger Him, and do what in them lyes to caſt reproach upon Him, as if He were no Saviour at all, or an inſufficient Saviour; to put Him to Suffer over again, in His wanting of Satisfaction for His Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; As it is a great pain for a Mother to be in Travel, but it's another, and in ſome reſpect, a greater pain, if the Child die in the bringing forth: In the 10. <hi>Chap. v.</hi> 28. It's called, A <hi>trading under foot the ſon of God, and an accounting the blood of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to be an unholy thing,</hi> And in the 26. <hi>v.</hi> Before it's ſaid, <hi>There remains no more ſacrifice for ſin, but a certain fearful looking for of judgement;</hi> And it's upon this very account; As we did at another occaſion, make uſe of theſe two Scriptures to a like purpoſe, and did thus Caution our Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them againſt miſtakes) For what greater indignity can be put on Him, then, when His Satisfaction depends on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of His Sufferings, yet people will not do it? As nothing pleaſes Him better then to improve His Sufferings, ſo, on the contrary, There is no Sin that doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe Him more, then when they are not improven: And if ye will not now believe this to be a Truth, yet, when the Lord ſhall call you to count for it, ye will find it to be a moſt certain and ſad Truth; That He called you to believe, and that ye would lye ſtill in your Unbelief, Ignorance, and Prophanity; That ye deſtroyed your own Souls, and made His Sufferings as uſeleſſe, as to you, as if there had never a door been opened to Sinners, to Heaven, by them. Is there any of you that will be able to anſwer to this challenge? If not, Then let Him have this Satisfaction, by improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of His Sufferings, that He may find (to ſay ſo) that His Death hath not been for nought, as to you: Study to have Him great in your eſteem, and to have your Souls ſaved by the vertue and efficacy of His Sufferings, otherwayes the challenge will be unanſwerable; Conſidering, that He declared, that this would ſatisfie Him, and ye knew that it would have pleaſed Him, and removed the quarrel, and ſaved your ſelves; And that withall, by this means, a comfortable ſentence at Judgement might have been procured to you; And that yet ye diſdained to do it: And therefore, ſince it ſtands ſo with you, be intreated to make earneſt, and greater earneſt of believing, and of the great work of getting your own Souls ſaved, which He hath thought ſo much of; elſe it had been better for you, that ye had never had a delightſome hour in the World; And ſad will the encount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be, that ye will have with Him, and with your own Conſcience in that Day, when it ſhall have this to tell you, that ye cannot now expect any Good, or Favour
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:152256:200"/> from the Judge; Becauſe, when He would have ſaved you, ye would not have it ſo, but would needs run on your own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And therefore we ſay again, either give Him Satisfaction, by improving of His Sufferings, and by making Earneſt of the buſineſſe of your Salvation, Or, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to meet with a moſt terrible Purſuer of the Quarrel againſt you; The Wrath of God is dreadfull, but much more the Vengeance of the Mediator, who, becauſe ye would not give Him His will in your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, He ſhall have it in your Ruine, and Deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is here a ſweet Word of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to poor Souls, that faln would have Sin taken away, and are afraid to preſume; Our Lord will never be angry, that ye make uſe of His Sufferings for your own good; Nay, He accounts it a Satisfaction to Him, that ye improve them; That when ye find your ſelves Arreſted for Sin, ye put it on His Score, and draw a Bill on Him to pay your Debt; That when you find your ſelves under that, which to you looks like the dominion of Sin, ye look to His Croſs, for Vertue to Crucifie, Kill, and Subdue it: If therefore (as I have often ſaid) ye would do Him a Favour, or Pleaſure, make uſe of Him; Be aſſured, that the more weight ye lay on Him, ye do Him the greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; And this is all the amends that He ſeeks for all the wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngs ye have done to Him, and all the Satisfaction that He ſeeks, for all the good turns He hath done to you, That ye come to Him thus to make uſe of Him; And it is good Reaſon, even all the Reaſon in the World, that He get this amends made to Him, and this Satisfaction granted to Him.</p>

            <p>THere are two things of great Concernment for Men to know, for ſinfull Men to know (if any thing be of Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) The one is, how the Juſtice of God that is provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may be Satisfied, or what it is, by which provoked Juſtice is Satisfied: And the other is, What the way is, how we come to get that Satisfaction applyed to us, or, what is the way to get the Benefit of it made ours? And both of them are Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this <hi>v.</hi> clearly and ſhortly; The firſt is holden out in the firſt part of the <hi>v.</hi> To be <hi>the travel of Chriſts ſoul,</hi> Which hath a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial look to the Covenant of Redemption, and to the Condition on which it is Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed and Performed, That is, His <hi>Soul-travel,</hi> under which all His Sufferings are comprehended; The other is, in the Latter Part of the <hi>verſe; By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their iniquities;</hi> This holds forth in ſhort, the Goſpel, nay, how a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may be brought to get the Benefit of Chriſt's Satisfaction; Theſe two being the Sum of the Goſpel, To wit, Chriſt's Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, and the Application of it to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <pb n="395" facs="tcp:152256:200"/>
            <p>In this laſt part of the <hi>verſe,</hi> We have theſe <hi>Five</hi> things to be conſidered, which expreſs this, 1. The great benefit that flows from Chriſt's Sufferings, and it is <hi>Juſtification,</hi> Which in a word is this much, To be Abſolved, Acquited, and ſet Free from the Guilt of Sin, and from the Curſe of God, <hi>Juſtifying</hi> here being oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Condemning;</hi> So that when its ſaid, <hi>They ſhall be juſtified,</hi> The meaning is, that theſe that were before obnoxious to the Curſe, and that were by the Law to be Condemned (according to that Word, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one that abids not in all things written in the law to do them</hi>) Shall now, through the benefit of Chriſt's Sufferings, be declared Free, and ſet at Liberty, even as a Debtor is ſet Free by the interveening of a Reſponſall Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner 2. The Parties made partakers of the Benefit, And they are called, <hi>Many;</hi> though they are few, being compared with the World, yet in themſelves they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; <hi>They ſhall come,</hi> or many ſhall come; <hi>From the eaſt, and from the weſt, and from the ſouth, and from the north, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;</hi> And comparing this Word with the laſt Words of the <hi>v.</hi> It ſayes, That they are as many as theſe are whoſe iniquities He bare, and the payment of whoſe Debt He undertook; It is not to be taken Univerſally for all, but for ſome ſingular Selected Perſons, whoſe iniquities He bare. 3. The Fountain from which, or from whom this Benefit flows to many; It's the Lords <hi>righteous ſervant, he ſhall justifie many;</hi> Where the effect is attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alone to Him. 4. The way how Chriſt Juſtifies; its not ſimply, by forgiving (as He indeed hath power to forgive Sins,) But <hi>meritoriouſly,</hi> To wit, by His Satisfying for them, Therefore it is added, <hi>For he ſhall bear their iniquities;</hi> He ſhall take on their Sins, and pay their Debt; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when they come before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of God, the Guilt of their Sins is taken off them through His Merit: 5. The great Midſe, or Mean, by which this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is derived to theſe many, it is <hi>by his knowledge,</hi> Which is not to be taken <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively,</hi> for the Knowledge that He hath. But <hi>Objectively,</hi> That is, He, by making Himſelf known by believing; Or, it's <hi>by his knowledge,</hi> not <hi>Actively,</hi> but <hi>Paſively</hi> taken, not His Knowledge, whereby He doth Know, but that whereby He is Known; It's in a word, by Faith, Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10. <hi>I account all things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle there) <hi>loſs, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And he expones what that is in the next Words, <hi>That I may be found in him, not having my own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is according to the law, but the righteouſneſs of God, which is by the faith of him:</hi> Theſe may afterward be more fully cleared, as we come to ſpeak to them more particularly.</p>
            <p>There is here then a brief Compend of the Goſpel, and of the way of Sinners Reconciliation with God; So that if ye would know, 1. How a Sinner is Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or wherein it conſiſts? here it is, It conſiſts not in the infuſing of Grace, nor in the Sanctifying, or making of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Perſon Holy, Though that doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company alwayes, and follow Juſtification; But in the abſolving of a Sinner from the Guilt of Sin, or in acquiting the Guilty. 2. Would ye know the Ground on which this goeth, or how it comes to paſs, That the Juſt God can Juſtifie an ungodly Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? It is becauſe of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs? and of His Satisfying of Juſtice, or paying of the Sinners Debt. 3: Would ye know, how it comes, that this Man, and not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, comes to get Chriſt's Satisfaction made his, and hath his Debt thereby taken off? It is by His Knowledge, and by Faith in Him, (<hi>called knowledge;</hi> here, Becauſe it neceſſarily preſuppoſes the Knowledge of Him;) It is by acknowledging of Him in His Offices, and by ſubmitting, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of our ſelves to Him by Faith; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Articled in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, That His Righteouſneſſe ſhall be made forthcoming to all them that by Faith betake themſelves to Him for ſhelter; So that hereby the ungodly are declared Righteous, becauſe, through the Caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Payment, and Satisfaction, their Sin is
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:152256:201"/> not imputed to them, and they are declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Free, becauſe of His paying of their Debt for them. 4. Would ye know the Reaſon of this, how it comes, that Faith Juſtifies in it's reſting on Chriſt? It is not becauſe of any worth in it ſelf, nor becauſe of any account that is made of it's Worth, but becauſe it reſts on Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and takes hold of the Benefit of Chriſt's Purchaſe; Therefore it is added, <hi>Becauſe he ſhall bear their iniquities,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by Faith they take hold of His Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Satisfaction, whereby their Sin is taken away, and God becomes well-pleaſed with them for His ſake: This then is a moſt material place of Scripture, and we had need in entring upon it, to have an Eye to this <hi>Righteous ſervant,</hi> That He would be pleaſed to make the Meaning of it known to us, and to give us the right underſtanding of this great Myſtery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In general <hi>Obſerve</hi> here, in what Eſtate Men are Naturally, and as Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from Chriſt; They are unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and lying under God's Curſe, obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to His Wrath, This is ſuppoſed, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Men then in their Natural Eſtate, this is it, They are even obnoxious to the Wrath and Curſe of God, which is ready to ceize upon them, for their breach of Gods Covenant, and for provoking of Him by Sin; if Men thought ſeriouſly on this, how could they ſleep, or have peace; not knowing when they may be Arreſted, and put in Priſon, till they pay the uttermoſt Farthing, which will never be; O! that ye knew and believed this, who are ready to defie any that will offer to charge you with one penny of Debt, and who walk up and down without all fear of your hazard; Lay your Natural Eſtate to heart, and ye will have quite other thoughts of your ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> The way how freedome from this Debt of Sin, and lyableneſs to the Curſes derived; And to this, many things concur, each of which hath it's own place. 1. The Mediator and His Satisfaction, This is the Ground of the Freedom. 2. The Covenant of Redemption, and the Promiſe made to the Mediator in it, <hi>He ſhall ſee his ſeed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied, By his knowledge ſhall many be juſtified,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein it is Articled, That theſe for whom He Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be Pardoned and ſet free; And it is this that gives Sinners acceſs to expect the Benefit of Chriſt's Sufferings; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, though Chriſt had Suffered, they had not been the better of His Sufferings, if this Covenant had not been, which gives them warrand to lay hold on the ſame; Ere Faith can <hi>Act</hi> on Chriſts Sufferings, it muſt have this Ground laid down, That it hath a warrand by Vertue of this Covenant to lay hold on them. 3. The knowledge and offer of this Myſterious Contrivance of Grace, is alſo neceſſary, and doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to bring about the Freedom; This muſt be manifeſted, that there is ſuch a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſuch a Satisfaction, and ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, wherein the Ground is laid down, and a Warrand given, by Vertue of this Covenant to make Uſe of Chriſt's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and to come by the Benefit of it; This is implyed in that Word, <hi>His know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> So, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. It's ſaid, <hi>How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard,</hi> which ſayes plainly, That there can not be Faith, except knowledge preceed; I obſerve this the rather, becauſe many think to come to Heaven without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſo continue ſtill in their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; But ere their can be ſound Faith, there muſt neceſſarly be ſome meaſure of Knowledge of theſe things, that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be known; As, that we are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and that we are loſt in our ſelves; That Jeſus Chriſt is the alone Propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Sin, and that according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, they that believe on Him ſhall be Abſolved, and ſet Free. 4. There is a concurring of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for taking hold of this Benefit of Offered-ſalvation through Chriſt; how Faith concurres with Chriſts Satisfaction, in order to the making of our Peace with God, We ſhall not now ſtand to ſpeak particularly, only in general, it is by His Knowledge that it Juſtifies; For, though He have ſufficient Righteouſneſſe, and though the Covenant give warrand to take hold of it, yet, if there be not an
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:152256:201" rendition="simple:additions"/> actual taking hold of it, It will not profit us; Therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. and 9.30. It is called, <hi>The righteouſneſs which is by faith in him;</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> It is not Faith without it's Object Chriſt, nor the Object Chriſt without Faith; But it is Faith taking hold of Him as it's Object, by which we have acceſs to plead for Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; without Chriſt, our Faith will do us no good, and without Faith Chriſt will not profit us; For without Faith we have no Title to Chriſt: And each of theſe would be put in their own Room and Place; Chriſt in His Room, and Faith in it's Room, as the condition on which His Purchaſe is made offer of to us.</p>
            <p>More particularly, Let me, <hi>First,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Title that Chriſt gets in theſe Words, He is called the Lords <hi>Servant,</hi> and His <hi>Righteous ſervant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As for <hi>Servant,</hi> It looks to Him as Mediator, as this whole <hi>Chapter</hi> with <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 42.1. and 52.13. do abundantly clear; Chriſt Jeſus then as Mediator, is the Lords Servant, or He, in performing the Office of Mediator, is His Fathers Servant, ſo the Lord calls Him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19. When He ſays, <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have found David my ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. For He is there ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt, with whom the Covenant of Grace, as with the head of the Confederated Party, is principally made: It imports theſe <hi>Four,</hi> which may be as ſo many Reaſons of this Deſignation. 1. An Humiliation, and Inferiority, in reſpect of God, as it's ſaid, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>He humbled himſelf, and became of no reputation;</hi> In which reſpect, He Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſayes, that <hi>the Father is greater then he;</hi> And that <hi>He is ſent,</hi> That He <hi>came not to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him;</hi> This holds forth a great Wonder, in the diſpenſation of Grace, That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Fellow and Equal, He that was Lord and Maſter of all, ſhould become a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the Work of Redemption, for the ſaving of Souls; This muſt ſute be a great Work, wherein the Son becomes a Servant, As it muſt be a greater Wonder, that Grace ſo far condeſcended, as to make Him, who is the Prince of Life, to become a Servant; And we would look at it, as a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and far more momentuous buſineſs, then we uſe to do, to get a Soul ſaved. 2. It imports His Prerogative, as being Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and Eminently Gods Servant; He is called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. <hi>The great ſhepherd,</hi> So may He be called the great Steward, and Deputy over all the Lord's Houſe; So then, He is a Singular Choiſe, and Non-ſuch Servant; <hi>Behold,</hi> ſayes Jehovah, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. <hi>My ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delighteth;</hi> Though all be Gods Servants, yet in this reſpect, He is Singularly, and Solly a Servant, as He is Great Lord Deputie, made head over all things to the Church, who was before all things, and is preferred to all things; This is very Comfortable to Believers, to conſider, that though Our Lord Jeſus be a Servant, yet He is a Choice and Singular Servant, Adminiſtrator, and Steward for their Good, it being for them that He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Servant. 3. It imports the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Taſk, or Work that is laid on Him, and the Commiſſion that He hath gotten, to follow forth, and proſecute that Work, which is the main Reaſon of this Deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Servant,</hi> Becauſe He is intruſted with carrying on the Great Work of the Redemption of Elect Sinners; Therefore He ſayes, <hi>I came not to do my own will, but the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work;</hi> And <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do;</hi> Becauſe He is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly intruſted with the bringing about of that Work, He hath gotten ſo many given Him to Redeem, and Save, to whom He is appointed a Shepherd, a Head, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeer, or Biſhop, Therefore He calls Himſelf the <hi>good ſhepherd;</hi> And is called by the Apoſtle; the <hi>Shepherd and Biſhop</hi> (or Overſeer) of Souls; And of all that are given Him He loſeth none, but maketh accompt of them all: And this is yet more Comfortable, when we conſider that Chriſt is not a Servant ſimply, but a Servant Commiſſionat to gather in Souls, to bring home the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:152256:202"/> This is His Office, and Service, even to ſatisfie for the Sins of ſuch, to deſtroy the power that the Devil hath over them, and ſo ſubdue Sin in them. 4. It imports this, that the Work which He performs in the Redeeming of Souls is ſo acceptable to God, and doth ſo mightily concur, and Co-oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at to the promoving of His Deſign, that the Lord owns every thing that He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms, as performed by His Great Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; and by Him, who hath the Truſt of all the affairs of His Houſe committed to Him, So that Our Lord Jeſus, in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Work of Redemption, cannot but be acceptable to Jehovah, becauſe it is a performing of that with which He hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted Him. Therefore, <hi>John</hi> 4. He ſayes, that <hi>it is his meat to do his fathers will,</hi> and to finiſh His Work; And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, He ſayes to His ſuppoſed Father, and to His Mother, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.49. <hi>wiſt ye not that I muſt be about my fathers buſineſs?</hi> It's His Buſſineſs, becauſe it is ſo on the matter, it's ſo accounted of, and comes to be ſo, in the end, and therefore, in the 10. <hi>v.</hi> of this <hi>Chap.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>The pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As for His being the Lord's <hi>righteous ſervant;</hi> He is not only a Servant, but an excellent Servant; not Righteous ſimply, as He is God only, nor Righteous, ſimply as He is Man; But Righteous in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of His Offices, and in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Great Truſt committed to Him. Whence <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That Our Lord Jeſus, in performing of the Office, and Work of Mediation and Redemption, is moſt Truſty, and Faithful: There is not any the leaſt Fault or Failling in His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of it; He is the Lord's Servant, that never wronged His Maſter, who never miſcarried in His Commiſſion, nor Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>managed it in the leaſt; Saith He, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> If we look a litle to the qualifications, that ſhine eminently in the Adminiſtration of His Offices, they will make out this; For He Adminiſtrats them. 1. Wonderfully Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 2. Very Tenderly. 3. Moſt Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and Effectually. 4. With all Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe: Thus doth He Intirely, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without the leaſt touch of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe perform all the Truſt committed to Him, and that both towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sheep; So as He is eminently, by the Lord's own Teſtimony, <hi>His righteous ſervant,</hi> with whom He is well pleaſed, and cannot but be well pleaſed: It will not be needfull to ſeperat theſe qualifications of His Service, in the Adminiſtration of His Offices: In ſpeaking to them, we ſhall only deſire you to take notice of ſome few Places of Scripture that hold them out; The firſt whereof is that, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.11. <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a ſhepherd, he ſhall gather the lambs with his arme, and carrie them in his boſome, and gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi> Never ſhepherd was ſo careful of his Flock; for He ſeeds them, and in Feeding them waits diligently on them, and takes them to theſe places where it is beſt for them to Feed; He thinks fit now and then, it's true, that Dogs be hunded at them, yet He is ſo warm to, and tender of them, that He ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers them with His Arme, and He is ſo dexterous, and ſkilfull in Conducting them, that He gently leads them that are with young; that is, ſuch of them as are in Pangs of the New Birth, He will by no means over-drive: To ſpeak it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; He is as a ſkilfull Midwife, to make theſe who are with Child ſafely to bring forth; Well then may He get this Name, of the Lord's <hi>righteous ſervant.</hi> The next place is, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, my elect, in whom my ſoul delighteth, I have put my ſpirit upon him he ſhall bring forth judgement to the gentles. He ſhall not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his voice to be heard in the ſtreet. A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, and the ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench, he ſhall bring forth judgement unto truth,</hi> &amp;c. Is there not here a wonderfull commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Father gives to the Son, and that the Gracious Maſter gives to the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous Servant in His Office. He is His E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect choiſe Servant, in whom His Soul delights, He does not cry, nor lift up His voice; He is buſſier about His Work, then in making any din about it; there is no
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:152256:202"/> frowardneſſe in His way, but He is tender of Souls that are like to a bruiſed Reed, and ſmoaking Flax; He will not break the one, nor put out the other; Where a Soul is weak or wounded, He will not break nor bruiſe it, by a rough touch, or word; and where there are the leaſt brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things of ſincere deſires after Him, He will not quench nor ſtiffle them; and though the Taſk be great, that He hath in hand, He fails not is going through with it, He ſits not up, nor is He diſcouraged under it, notwithſtanding all the Wrath He hath to meet with in His way; Therefore, when the Cup is put in His hand, at which His holy humane Nature ſome way ſhrunk and ſkarred, yet He takes it pleaſantly, ſaying, <hi>But for this cauſe came I unto this hour;</hi> and proſecuteth His Work Courageouſly, and Conſtantly, till He bring forth Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Victory, and till He gain His Point; This ſhews Him to be a moſt Choiſe and Faithfull Servant. A 3. Place is, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.13. <hi>Behold my ſervant ſhall deal prudently.</hi> &amp;c. It cannot be imagined, what a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, Cannie, and Dexterous way He hath in the ſaving of Souls, and how Wiſely, and Prudently He purſues that Work: There is a 4th. Place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19, 20. <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one choſen out of the people, I have found David my ſervant. The enemy ſhall not exact upon him,</hi> &amp;c. He is ſo Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous and Powerful, that the Devil ſhall gain no ground of Him, but He ſhall gain ground of him, and defeat him; ſo that we come after only to gather the Spoil. <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt,</hi> (as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26.) <hi>all that come unto God through him;</hi> And near the cloſe of that <hi>Chap.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmleſs, ſeperat from ſinners, made higher then the heavens.</hi> Theſe are His quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, He is an holy and harmleſs high Prieſt, a ſweet (and to ſay ſo) illeſſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; by whom there was never any hurt; His ill was never heard of, in the place where He was; He is Undefiled, Pure and Spotleſſe, in the management of all the Truſt committed to Him; there was never any thing done by Him, of which it could be ſaid, that it might have been done better; He is ſeperat from Sinners, and ſo another kind of high Prieſt then theſe who were before Him; And all this, both as to God, ſo as He could ſay, and go to Death with it, <hi>It is finiſhed;</hi> And as to them that were intruſted to Him, ſo as He cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d ſay, <hi>Of all that thou hast given me, I have lost none;</hi> he makes a Full and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full accompt of all committed to Him.</p>
            <p>This is a plain, and yet a moſt uſefull Truth: For <hi>Uſe</hi> of it. Behold here, and wonder at the way of Grace, that not only gives a Mediator, but ſuch a Mediator, who (as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <hi>is faithfull over the houſe of God:</hi> This is the very Life of our Conſolation, that we have an able Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, a good Shepherd, a Wiſe, Prudent, Tender One, and Faithfull; and indeed it would well become us to wonder more, that the Lord, in the way of His Grace hath thus condeſcended; and it ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly provocke us to be thankfull on this accompt, that not only there is a way of Grace, but ſuch a way of Grace found out, and eſtabliſhed, whereby we have ſuch an high Prieſt, that manages all ſo Well, and ſo Dexterouſly. O! have ye ever ſuitably Prized this, That God hath given ſuch a Righteous and Faithfull Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and Servant? I fear many ſuffer this moſt obſervable Diſpenſation to paſſe without due Obſervation; Though the Lord Jehovah ſpeaks not of Him without commending Him; yet wretched and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate, we can, Alace! ſpeak of Him, and hear Him ſpoken of, with hearts very little affected: Believers may be aſhamed of this; we think lamentably little of Him, we eſteem not ſuitably of Him; when we ſee Him, there is ſcarce any Form or Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeen in Him, wherefore we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Him, we do in a great meaſure under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value this way of Graces Adminiſtration, that ſhould be in a ſpecial manner Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, that we are thereby brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a Tutory:</p>
            <p>The 2d. <hi>Uſe,</hi> Is for Believers Comfort, and Incouragement; O! but they are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that have committed themſelves to Him, as to a Faithful Shepherd and Overſeer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:152256:203"/> They may be ſure that He is a notable and non-ſuch Overſeer: As might be more fully cleared, if we would deſcend to the particulars of Believers need: Have they little Grace? Is it ſcarce ſmoaking? He is not a rigid Taſk-maſter, like to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> nay, nor like to the Law, He quenches not the ſmoaking Flax- Are they ſtaggering, becauſe of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended or real Weakneſs, and their hearts ſhaking as the Trees in the Wood, or rather like ſo many Straes? They may with Comfort give Him the Over-ſight of them, He will not break the bruiſed Reed, He will bear the heavieſt end of His own Yoke. Have they a ſtraying Diſpoſition? Are they like young wanton Lambs leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from the reſt? He will gather them with His Arme; and when He takes a rougher way, yet Grace ſhines ſtill in it; Are they Fainting and Swooning? He will take them into His Boſom; He will lead the Blind, He bears the Weak, He hath a way of Supporting His own that is moſt Tender. <hi>My grace</hi> (ſayes He to <hi>Paul) is ſufficient for thee; my strength is made perfect in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Are their any of them with Child (to ſpeak ſo) Or is their bringing forth quick and lively? He gently leads thoſe that are with young, and will not ſuffer them to miſcarry, in the bringing forth; He will not <hi>put new wine into old bottles, he will not cauſe to travel, and not make to bring forth;</hi> The Lord hath given Believers ſuch a Servant as they ſtood in need of, even a Righteous Servant, ſuited every way to their Condition, who will not be behind, nor wanting in looking to the leſt wrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, (to ſpeak ſo) under His Care and Overſight.</p>
            <p>It ſerves therefore, In the 3d. Place to reprove the Suſpitions, and Jealouſies that Believers have often of Chriſt, who are diſpoſed to ſay with the <hi>Pſalmist, Pſal.</hi> 77. <hi>I ſaid, my hope and my strength is periſhed from the Lord, will the Lord caſt off for ever? will he be favourable no more? is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promiſe fail for evermore? hath he forgotten to be gracious?</hi> &amp;c. Nay, the Jealouſie, and Miſbelief of ſome ſerious Souls, will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times talk it this Rate, I may give it over, this work will never go with me; beware, I beſeech you of this; for the language of it is, That Our Lord is not a Righteous Servant; Let therefore your Spirits be calmed, and pray the Lord to command a calme in them which are committed to Him. Beſpeak your Souls as <hi>David</hi> did his, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul? And why art thou diſquieted in me? Truſt in God;</hi> For He is Faithfull (as if he had ſaid,) that hath the overſight of me. And eſſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> to be in caſe to ſay, <hi>I know whom I have believed;</hi> and ſo ſhall not be aſhamed; <hi>I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him, againſt that day.</hi> I know that He is ſuch a Chriſt, that I commit my ſelf to, who is ſo Skilfull, Dexterous, Tender and Faithfull, in keeping that which is given Him. And is not this moſt comfortable; and a notable ground of quietneſs; That Our Mediator is ſuch as cannot miſcarry; And may it not ſhame Believers, when either they adventure upon any thing their alone without Him; or, when they commit themſelves to Him, and yet do not ſo intirely Truſt Him, but entertain Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Jealouſies of Him, and think, becauſe their Spark is not a Fire, or a Flame, but Smoaks only, that therefore it will die out, and be utterly quenched, as if He could not keep it in, and increaſe it; and becauſe they cannot guide themſelves, think that they will utterly miſcarry, as if He had not Armes to carrie them; indeed Preſumption is to be abhorred; but ſuch as are fled in to Him, would truſt in Him ſo far, as to keep up their hearts in Him, and would ſtudie to be cheerfull in Him, and to walk up and down in His ſtrength; this is certainly called for from you; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be content to be born by Him, where ye cannot go your alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. Is He ſuch a Righteous Servant? Then let me ſay, are there any of you that need to fear, or to have the leaſt hink, or heſitation, to commit your ſelves to Him? And ſhould it not be a Motive to preſs you to give Him credit? For He ſayes, <hi>John</hi> 6.39, 40. That it's His Commiſſion and Service to keep them, which are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:152256:203"/> to Him, and to raiſe them up at the laſt Day, and to give them Eternal Life; And He is Righteous and Faithfull in Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; If ſo, then credit the Salvation of your Souls to this Righteous Servant; <hi>Commit your ſouls in well-doing to him, as unto a faithfull creator;</hi> Never be at peace, nor at eaſe, till ye be under His Charge and Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and though ye be as little Lambs, as weak Wriglings, or heavy with Young, it's the leſs matter, if ye be of His Flock, ye ſhall be preſerved: Is it poſſible that ye can be right if ye be from under His Care and Cuſtody? Nay, it's utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that ye can be ſecure, but under His Care; And it's as impoſſible, but that ye muſt be ſafe, if ye be under His Care and Overſight: And therefore endeavour to be within the reach of it, and to count your ſelves happy, when ye do ſincerely give Him credit; and to believe that ye are in greateſt hazard, when ye take moſt on your ſelves. What a ſhame will it be to many, who have heard that Chriſt was ſuch a Servant, and yet they would not take His Service to bring them through to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Thus it ſtands with you, to whom He is ſpoken of in the Goſpel, ye ſhall be found either to have accepted or rejected Him, according as by Faith, ye yeeld your ſelves to Him, or by unbelief, ye refuſe to cloſe with Him: Let not this word ſlip, as many have done. And the Lord Himſelf make you wiſe, to make choiſe in time of the Service of this Righteous Servant, for your Juſtification and Salvation.</p>

            <p>IF we had ſuch thoughts of the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our own Souls, as the Lord had, and ſtill hath of the Salvation of Souls, we could not but be more ſeriouſly concerned about them, and more taken up, how to get them ſaved: This Work of the Salvation of Sinners did before the World was (to ſpeak ſo with reverence) take up the Perſons of the Glorious Godhead; and was ſingled out, and made choiſe of, as an imployment worthy of the Son of God, who was choſen for this very Work; that by Him many might be Juſtified and Saved; For the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of which, He became a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: Muſt it not then be an excellent Work, that none but He could be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, who is Heir of all things, and by whom the World was made?</p>
            <p>We ſhew you the meaning of theſe Words the laſt Day, and <hi>Obſerved</hi> two things from this Deſignation, that Our Lord gets here. 1. That Our Lord Jeſus, in the Work of Mediation, and of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Sinners, was Gods Servant, not ſo much to denote His being inferiour, as Mediator to the Father; as to hold forth His being Commiſſionated for this Service, and the Lord accepting of Him in it. 2. That Our Lord Jeſus did excellently diſcharge this Truſt committed to Him. Therefore He is not only called a <hi>Servant,</hi> but <hi>my righteous ſervant,</hi> as having moſt Faithfully acquitted Himſelf, and as being fully approven, and accepted in the Truſt committed to Him. When the Lord ſpeaks ſo of Chriſt, It ought mightily to ingage us
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:152256:204"/> to be much in love with God, who hath given ſuch a Faithfull Mediator aad Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and with Jeſus Chriſt, that conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to take the Truſt of poor Sinners Salvation, and that doth ſo kindly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it. There are ſomethings here, that may be paſſingly hinted at, and then we ſhall come more cloſely and particularly to the Words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That it is a Priviledge and Prerogative to be Gods Servant; Therefore it's mentioned here as a Piece of the Mediators Priviledge; It is true, He was Singularly, and Eminently a Servanr even the Lords Choice Servant, in whom His Soul delighted, and does delight, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what any others can be capable of; yet to be a Servant to God, to take directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Him, to do His Will, to ſeek His Honour, to give obedience to Him, in what He calleth for, is certainly a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and a great one; yea, it is ſpoken of as a Priviledge of Glorified Saints in Heaven, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.3. <hi>His ſervants ſhall ſerve him,</hi> And if it be a Priviledge in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we would think it ſo here on Earth; and yet if the Language of our hearts were known, there would be found a ſecret diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining of, and repyning at ſervice to God, and a ſaying on the matter; <hi>Let us break his bonds aſunder, and caſt away his cords from us.</hi> But know ye what ye are doing? Even diſclaiming and deſpiſing that which is your great Priviledge; all thoſe that are in Heaven, and all thoſe who are in a right frame on Earth, count it their Priviledge to be His Servants; and we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pray; <hi>Thy will be done on Earth as it is done in heaven.</hi> Or, be thou ſerved on Earth, as thou art in Heaven: Therefore, it ought to be accounted of, as a Priviledge, as a great and glorious Priviledge to be His Servants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That the Lord can tell ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and infallibly, how every Servant car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries himſelf; Who are ill and ſloathfull, and who are good and faithfull Servants; Who are righteous Servants according to their meaſure, and who not. Will He take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how Chriſt carries Himſelf in His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and Truſt, and will He not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of others? Moſt certainly He will; and therefore, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. and <hi>Luke</hi> 19. He calls the Servants to a Reckoning, to whom the Talents are given; and as they have made uſe of them, and improved them, or not; ſo doth He commend and reward them, or not: There are none of us, but have gotten ſome one Talent and Truſt, or an other, and no doubt, there will be much to Reckon for; I am afraid, that when He calls us all to an accompt, though there will be ſome to whom it will be ſaid, <hi>Well done good and faithfull ſervant;</hi> There will be many to whom it will be ſaid, <hi>Thou evil and ſloathfull ſervant;</hi> and the <hi>Sloathful ſervant</hi> will be found to be the <hi>Ill Servant,</hi> and amongſt other Aggravations of his guilt, this will be one, that he was unlike to Chriſt the Righteous Servant.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That the right improvement and diſcharge of the Truſt committed to us, and of our ſervice to God; is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and honourable thing. It is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded here to Chriſts Commendation, that He was a <hi>Righteous ſervant,</hi> even Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full over the Houſe of God, in all things; and Proportionably is the Commendation of the ordinary under-ſervants, when they, in their Places and Stations perform their Service honeſtly and faithfully, ſo as they may be accepted of God on His account: The day is coming, when every mans work will be rewarded; and as we Sow, ſo ſhall we Reap; In that Day, if we had all the World, we would give it, to hear that Word from Chriſts mouth, <hi>Well done thou good and faithfull ſervant.</hi> But iew will get that Teſtimony: ye think it much now, to get a name of Fidelity amongſt Men, and to be eſteemed ſuch as keep your Word, and will not break your Promiſe, nor Parrol (and it's good in ſo far, that it be ſo) but many ſuch will be found to have broken many a Word to God, and falſified many a Promiſe; think upon it, and lay it to heart, that it will be better to have a Word of Teſtimony from God in that Day, and to have it ſaid to you, by Him, Faithfull Servant thou improved wel the little that I gave thee, it was laid out, and expended not ſo much to buy, and to
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:152256:204"/> put on brave Cloaths, nor to buy or build fine houſes, as it was for Me, and for My Honour; Whatever Place, Station, Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, or Imployment thou was in, thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to do good in it; and when thou couldeſt not do for my Work, for my People, and for my Honour, thou was Praying for them; and when thou had an opportunity to hear my Word, thou didſt not ſlight, nor let that ſlip. This, I ſay, will be better than a great Name, and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from, and amongſt Men: But alace, we fear that it ſhall be ſaid of many, ye had many opportunities of getting, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, but what uſe made ye of them? It had been better that ye had never had them; it had been better that ye had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a Groat or two Pence, then to have had all theſe Riches; and to have had none rather then to have had ſuch and ſuch a Lucrative, or Gainfull Place and Imployment which ye improved not for God: It's a ſore matter, that we ſhould Preach, and ye ſhould hear theſe general Truths of the Goſpel, from day to day, and that yet they do not ſink into your hearts. Ye will not readily den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that there is a day of Reckoning coming; and that it will be a great favour to be commended of Him, in that day; and yet how few do by their Practice evidence, that they lay weight on it? It's very ſad that Religion ſhould be ſo triffled in; Many of you will come to the Church, and ſeem there, and in your other carriage, as if ye were going to Heaven, when, in the mean time, ye have few ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts, either of Heaven or of Hell; But in that Day wherein ye ſhall ſtand trembling before His Tribunal, and ſhall there receive the Sentence of an evil and ſloathfull Servant, ye will find to your coſt, That there was weight in theſe Truths, that now ye take but little notice of.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly. In General, <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That it's Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, Proper, and Peculiar, to Our Lord Jeſus to be Gods Approven Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; ſo as to be without all ground of Challenge, in the Diſcharge of His Duty, and Truſt; and indeed there is no Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous Servant, in this ſenſe, but He only, who, according to the very Rigor of the Law, was ſuch; the Law could not charge Him with any the leaſt violation of it, or want of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto it; For <hi>He fulfilled all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> We ſpoke to this, on <hi>v.</hi> 9. and ſhall not now inſiſt on it; Only it's a ſore matter, that this Truth ſhould be called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and called an untruth in theſe dayes; and that Men ſhould ſay, that this Deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Title is not proper to Chriſt, but that it's common to all true Chriſtians, as if they were all free of Sin; and that not by the imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to them, but by their own doing of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: Lord ſave us, what a high injury is this to the Son of God? And what groſs ignorance is here of the corruption of Mans Nature, which in the beſt and holieſt of meer Men, is never in this Life finally expelled, as the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament moſt convincingly clear, and what a wronging is this of the Truth of God, which holds forth Our Lord Jeſus, as ſingled out to be, and who is deſigned by this Name, <hi>The Lords righteous ſervant;</hi> Now if there were any moe properly ſo called, we could not ſay that it were meant of Him. But it's not very profitable to inſiſt in ſpeaking of theſe Dottages and Foolries.</p>
            <p>But to come more particularly to the benefits that flow from, and come by this <hi>Righteous ſervant,</hi> and from the ſervice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to Him, and ſo faithfully managed and diſcharged by Him; <hi>By his knowledge,</hi> (ſaith Jehovah) <hi>ſhall he juſtifie many:</hi> That is, His Service is to abſolve Sinners, and ſet them free from the guilt of Sin, and from the Curſe that Naturally they are under and lyable to.</p>
            <p>Looking on theſe Words in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the former, we ſhall <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſerve Three</hi> or <hi>Four</hi> things, ere we come to the more cloſs and particular Conſideration of the Words in themſelves.</p>
            <p>The 1. of which is this: That the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of many Sinners, even of all the Elect, is the ſpeciall Truſt, committed by Jehovah, to the Mediator. It is in this eſpecially, wherein His Service conſiſts: Would ye then know, what is the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this, Righteous Servant? It is even
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:152256:205"/> this, <hi>He ſhall juſtifie many.</hi> He ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Abſolution from the Guilt of Sin, and from the Curſe of God, and ſhall ſet them free from the Judgement which the Law hath againſt them, whereby they are oblidged to the Curſe, for diſobedience thereunto: This we may conſider. 1. As it relates to God; and ſo it imports, that the juſtification of a Sinner is very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to Him; For it is that for which He hath given a Commiſſion to the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and what He hath Commiſſioned Him in, the performance of it muſt needs be acceptable to Him: Therefore that which is here called <hi>the Lords Service,</hi> is called <hi>The Lords pleaſure. v.</hi> 10. To wit, to ſee a poor Sinner brought in by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and on the accompt of His Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction Juſtified, He is pleaſed with, and takes it well. 2. It may be conſidered as it looks to the Mediator; And ſo it ſpeaks out the Mediators Deſign and Work; it's that wherein He is imployed, and with which He is taken up, even to get Elect Sinners brought from under the Curſe of God, and freely Juſtified through Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; So that if ye would know what is the Sum, and Effect of Chriſts Errand, and Work in the World, here it is, <hi>He came to ſave ſinners;</hi> as it is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>He came to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt;</hi> To bring home the loſt ſheep on His ſhoulder; to ſeek and find the loſt Groat, to reclaim Prodigals; As it is <hi>Luke</hi> 15. This is His Meat and His Drink, His Work and Buſineſſe; as Himſelf ſayes, <hi>John</hi> 4.34. <hi>My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work.</hi> And, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. <hi>Know ye not that I muſt be about my Fathers buſineſs?</hi> Which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue poor Sinners from the Devil, and to ingage them to God, that their Sins may be Pardoned. 3. It imports the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Meetneſſe for this Service, that He is Furniſhed, Fitted and Qualified for, as well as taken up with the Juſtifying of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſetting them free before the Throne of God; He hath a full Purſe (to ſpeak ſo) to pay their Debt; Therefore, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.19. He bids Sinners, <hi>Come and buy of him eye-ſalve gold, and white rayment.</hi> He hath Eye-ſalve for the Blind, Gold to Inrich the Poor, Garments for the Naked; and in a Word, every thing that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Sinners. It is comfortable to hear that Chriſt is a Servant; But to hear that this is His Service, to Juſtifie Sinners, and that He is ſo well fitted for it, makes it ſo much the more comfortable: And were we ſuitably ſenſible of Sin, and did we throughly believe this Truth, our hearts would <hi>Laugh</hi> within us, as <hi>Abraham's</hi> once did, to know that this was given to Chriſt in Commiſſion, to Juſtifie Sinners, and that He is ſo well fitted for this Buſineſſe, that He is Commiſſioned about, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in; eſpecially now, when He is ſo buſſie about His Work, and Imployment, for though He be aſcended on high, yet <hi>He hath received gifts for, and given them to men, even for the rebellious, that God the Lord might dwell among them;</hi> As it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. compared with, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. This is the End of the Miniſtry and Ordinances, even to further this Work of the Juſtification of Sinners, that by acknowledging, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Uſe of Chriſt, this Work may be brought about, and this Effect made to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; this is the End of Faſts and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, even to Arreſt periſhing Sinners a while, to Tryſt, and Treat with Him, about the concerns of their Souls; theſe are ſpecial ſeaſons for putting Him to exerce His Office in Juſtifying of them; and this day, this Scripture is fulfilled in your ears, and ye ſhould let it ſink in your hearts, that Our Lord Jeſus is purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His Commiſſion, and performing His Service, keeping up the Treaty, and invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and perſwading Sinners to come to Him, that the pleaſure of the Lord may proſper in His hand. And therefore know aſſuredly that this is it, that Chriſt is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in, and taken up with, even to get ſinners fred from the Guilt of Sin, and from Wrath by His Righteouſneſſe; It is not only, nor mainly to get them brought to the Church, and to His Supper, or to get them made Formal, and to abſtain from Curſing, Swearing, and Profanity, (though theſe will follow of will) but it is to get them brought in to Himſelf, and Juſtified. And we have theſe two Words
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:152256:205"/> to ſay to you further in this matter. 1. There is here good ground of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a poor Soul, that would fain make Uſe of Chriſt for Pardon of Sin; This is even it that Chriſt is intruſted with; It is for this end that He is Legated and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned of the Father; And will He not, thinks thou, do that which He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with, and for which He is mainly ſent? <hi>This is,</hi> ſaith <hi>He, John</hi> 6.39. <hi>the will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him ſhould have everlaſting life, and that I ſhould raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Which is in Sum, <hi>That by his knowledge many ſhould be juſtified.</hi> And it's added, <hi>For he ſhall bear their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi> To anticipat and anſwer an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: For a ſenſible Sinner might ſay, how can I be juſtified, that have ſo many Sins? Here is a Solution of that doubt, <hi>He ſhall ſatisfie for them:</hi> All theſe Words are, (as it were) big with Child of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being the very Heart and Life of the Goſpel, as any thing that comes ſo near to Chriſts Commiſſion, and unfolds ſo much of it is. A 2d. Word is this, That ye miſtake Chriſts Errand, Work and Service very far, who think to content Him, and put Him off with this; who would give Him the Name of a Saviour, and yet would be at the ſaving of your ſelves without Him, who would complement Him, as it were with fair Generalls, but will have none of His Phiſick, or of His Cures, nor will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunce your own Righteouſneſs, and make uſe of His, for your Juſtification: This ſays one of theſe Four, Either that He is not Commiſſionated, and Truſted for this end, or that He is not meet for that Truſt; or, that He is not Faithfull in it; Or elſe that ye can do your own turn without Him, and that there is no need of His Office; And which of all theſe can abyde the Tryal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God? And yet it ſhall be upon one of theſe that ye ſhall be found to have caſt at Chriſt, and to have refuſed to permit Him, (ſo far as ye could hinder, and abſtruct) to do His Fathers buſineſs; and if ye Juſt not accompts with Him, there will be a moſt dreadfull Reckoning betwixt God and you.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That this particular Truſt anent the Juſtifying of Sinners, Our Lord Jeſus doth moſt Righteouſly, Diligently, Dextrouſly, Tenderly, and Faithfully Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. It was His Fathers will, that He ſhould be Baptized, and fulfill all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and more eſpecially, that He ſhould Juſtifie many, in this He is very Skilfull, and Faithfull, and it is on this account He is called <hi>The good ſhepherd,</hi> and that He is ſaid <hi>to lay down his life for his ſheep;</hi> That He is called <hi>a faithfull high Prieſt;</hi> and is ſaid to be one that is <hi>able to ſave to the uttermost theſe that come unto God through him;</hi> and that He is <hi>Holy, harmleſs, and ſeparat from ſinners;</hi> fit to make Peace betwixt God and Sinners, another ſort of Prieſt than <hi>Aaron</hi> was, or any that were before Him; <hi>He</hi> is in a word, <hi>ſuch a high Prieſt as became us,</hi> and as we ſtood in need of, who needed not to Offer Sacrifice for His own Sins He had no more to do, but to Satisfie for us. The Prophet <hi>Iſaias, Chap.</hi> 40.11. Tells how tender he is in bringing Souls to Heaven; <hi>He gathers the lambs with his arme, he carries them in his boſome, and gently leads thoſe that are with young.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.3. That <hi>a bruiſed reed he will not break, and the ſmoaking flax he will not quench.</hi> And it is ſaid, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an advocat with the Father,</hi> and who is he, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi> Righteous in the Faithfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging of His Truſt, by making Sinners Peace with God. Would ye know then, in what reſpects, or, on what account it is, that Chriſt is called <hi>Servant?</hi> We anſwer, in theſe Reſpects. 1. Though we have failled, and broken the Law, yet He hath not; and God will not look down on Him. 2. In this Reſpect, That He pleads for no Sinners Pardon, but He can fully pay their Debt, and hath done it; if He ſeek one thing from God, He yeelds in another; and according to the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion exactly proceeds; For He is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation, He ſeeks nothing but he payes for it, and wrongs not him in the leaſt who hath Truſted him; the Lord Jehovah is not a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:152256:206"/> for whom He hath undertaken; He is not only faithfull to the Maſter, but to the Children, and Servants; He owns and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges them, when they come to Him under their neceſſities, and is forthcoming to them; every way ſuitable, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to His Place, and Truſt in doing good to Sinners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> Had we ſenſible Sinners to ſpeak to, Sinners groaning under a Body of Death, with pricked hearts crying out, What ſhall we do, for the wrongs that we have done to God? Sinners under holy fear, to ſpoil and mar the Bargain, and to hazard their own Souls, had we, (I ſay) ſuch Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to ſpeak to; There are good news here to them; the Truſt of ſaving Souls is committed to a Faithfull Shepherd, it is not committed to your ſelves; for ſo, it had been a dolefull Truſt; but it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Him, that hath gotten the Sheep by Name given to Him, to be kept by Him, and He will not ſuffer them to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrie, nor to go quite wrong; And what more would ye have? A ſalvation and a Price is much, but it is more to have a Saviour, to make the Application of His Purchaſe; a Biſhop of Souls to Juſtifie, and carrie Sinners through, to make it ſure before God, and to make it out; the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may ſleep ſound, which in the ſenſe of Sin hath betaken himſelf to Him, to be Juſtified by His Righteouſneſs, and to be in His Debt, and Common for obtaining of Pardon, and for making the Application, of what, by His Sufferings, He hath Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed: We can ſay but little to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to you, who care not for your Souls, and are not ſenſible of your Sin, for He came to ſave Sinners, and if any ſuch do Truſt Him with the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When the loſt Sheep is amiſſing, He is not ſatisfied till it be brought home. The making the houſe clean will not pleaſe Him, if the loſt Piece of Money be not found; the finding whereof brings out that, <hi>Come and rejoyce with me.</hi> And when the Prodigal returns, then, and not till then, are uttered theſe joyfull words, <hi>This my ſon was dead, and is alive, he was loſt, and is found;</hi> Then comes the mirth, and all the Minſtrels are yocked. Would ye lay the hair of your head under Chriſts Feet, would ye give Him thouſands of Rams, and Rivers of Oyl, and the firſt-born of your Bodies for the Sin of your Souls; all theſe will not pleaſe Him, if ye get not your ſelves to be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by His Knowledge, nothing will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and ſatisfie Him but that: The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are. 1. Becauſe He gets not His Work intruſted to Him, carried on otherwayes (if I may ſpeak ſo) for as the Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to ſee the Work, which He hath truſted Him with, proſpering, ſo doth He: 2. Becauſe He gets not the native Credit and Honour, of His Office, till He get this, but counts Himſelf to be like to an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, who comes to wooe a Wife for the King, his Maſter, who is well Treat and Intertained; but gets a refuſal of what he came for: It was the Diſciples com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, <hi>John</hi> 17. That they received his word. Though all other things could be, if this be not, He never gets kindly reſpect. 3. Becauſe without this, Folk can never love Chriſt; for it's this benefit of Juſtification, and Pardon of Sin, that much ingages to love and praiſe Him: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> (ſay and ſing the Redeemed,) <hi>Revel.</hi>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:152256:206"/> 5.9.) <hi>Thou haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, thou art worthy to receive all praiſe, dominion, power, and glory:</hi> It's impoſſible that they can ſuitably eſteem of Him, and love Him, who are not Juſtified by Him; and therefore they that believe not on Him to Juſtification, are called <hi>Deſpiſers of him, and traders of the blood of the Covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot;</hi> and they fall under that ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, which is made, <hi>John</hi> 1.11. <hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not; be was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</hi> There is then a neceſſity laid upon you, either to give Him imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this, or to lye under His diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to be made countable for ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the way, ſo far as ye would, of His Satisfaction. The Lord hath ſo moulded the way of His Grace, that not only doth He invite and allure Sinners, but alſo He layes ſtrong Bonds on them for their good; and leaves it not indifferent to them, to make uſe of Chriſt, or not, for their Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; but they muſt either take this way, or have God, and the Mediator to be their enemies, in the greateſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and in the higheſt degree; chooſe you then, whether ye will Satisfie Chriſt Jeſus or not. How ſhall He be Satisfied? will ye ſay, even by your betaking of your ſelves to Him, and by improving His Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſſe, for your Peace with God, and for your Juſtification before Him; humbly pleading Guilty at the Bar of Juſtice, and Begging Pardon, and acceptance on the account of His Satisfaction, and by Faith, Extracting your Diſcharge, and Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſo the Application of His Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe being obtained, the Conſcience may be quieted on that ground. And do ye think this a matter to caſt out with Chriſt about? That He would have you Juſtified, and that ye will not; That He would have you waſhen in His Blood from your Sins, and that ye had rather lye ſtill in them: Think ye this reaſonable? And yet thus it ſtands with you, and we declare it to you, in His Name, That Chriſt and ye ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be Friends, except on theſe Terms; That ye take with your Sins, and Natural Enmity againſt God, and welcome heartily the News of a Mediator, and imbrace His Righteouſneſſe, trampling your own under your Feet, as to all expectation of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by it; That in a Word, ye do by Faith, take hold of the offer of Salvation through Him, in the Goſpel, Reſigning your ſelves abſolutely to Him, and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your humble Plea before God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. This is the Shield of Faith, that quenches the fiery Darts of the Devil, and that which gives Wings to the Soul, to flee to Heaven upon; and we wote well this is no unfriendly Meſſage, nor evil Bargain, and ye may have it of Him; He is indeed a Dexterous, and Skilfull handler of Souls, that commit themſelves unto Him. Why do you not then in His own way, hazard your Souls on Him? Were Sinners hazard known, and what ſolid confidence they may have, in putting their Souls in Chriſts hand, they would be thronging in upon Him, to get hold laid on His offer, which is like to a Banner diſplayed, and ſpread out in this Word of the Goſpel, to which every one may put his hand; This is the very Sum of the Goſpel, to pray you to be reconciled to God, to admit of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and to give Him a Commiſſion (to ſpeak ſo with reverence,) or rather to intreat Him, to make your Peace, that is, to give Him the credit of ſaving you; that if Juſtice were purſuing you, ye might be found in Him, not having your own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, but His; and in Him, have one Anſwer to all Challenges; not thinking your ſelves the leſs ſicker and ſure that ye have given up with your own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and betaken your ſelves to His, who knows but Souls might be getting good at ſuch a time, if this were made uſe of, and believed? O! ſo faithfull as He is,: He dar give His Word and Seal, that He will keep to you; And this is His end in Word and Sacrament, that Sinners might be brought to truſt in Him, in giving Him the imployment to Juſtifie them; That they being in themſelves blind, may come to Him for light; being poor, may come to Him for Gold to inrich them; being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ow from them, by which He ſhall be Satisfied for them all; which ye may take up in theſe Four. 1. The great benefit it ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that is holden out here, and that is <hi>Juſtification.</hi> 2. Theſe to whom it ſhall come, it is <hi>many,</hi> ſo that His having a Seed, ſpoken of, <hi>v.</hi> 10.

The ground from which this flows, and on which it is built, and that confirms it; <hi>For he ſhall bear their iniquiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;</hi> And as it's in the following <hi>v. He bare the ſin of many,</hi> And therefore they muſt be Juſtified; it being but reaſon, that theſe many, whoſe iniquities He bears, and whoſe Debt of Sin He payes, ſhould be Juſtified.</p>
            <p>We may ſpeak more particularly to the Explication of each of theſe, as we come to them; we ſhall then firſt expone, and give the meaning of this Word, <hi>Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or to <hi>Juſtifie</hi> ere we come to the Doctrine, becauſe it will ſerve to clear it, and will make way for it, and ſo much the rather, as it is the very hing of the Goſpel, and that on which our Salvation depends, though yet but very little, and very ill underſtood, there being many that cannot tell what it is, though there be not many Words more frequently mentioned in the Scripture, and though it be that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Perſon is tranſlated from the State of Enmitie, into the State of Friendſhip with God.</p>
            <p>As for this Word, <hi>To Juſtifie,</hi> or <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> then; there are three ſenſes given
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:152256:207"/> of it; Two whereof are Erronious, and the laſt only is according to the mind of the Spirit of God, ſpeaking in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which we ſhall Clear, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some take this Word <hi>Phyſically,</hi> as if it were to make Juſt, by the infuſing of habitual Grace, or by a Phyſical, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Change; and ſo taken, it is the ſame with that which we call Sanctification; but in all the Scripture we know not one Place, where neceſſarily the Word is ſo to be underſtood. Although this acceptation of the Word, is the great riſe of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Error, in that Controverſie concerning Juſtification. 2dly. Others take it for Gods Revealing Manifeſting, or Declaring the way, how a Guilty Perſon comes to be Juſt; and ſo to Juſtifie, is for Miniſters to teach the way to People, how they may live holily; As it is ſaid, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>They that turn many to Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. By wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch ſenſe, ſome Wickedly, and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly detract from Chriſts Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as if His Juſtifying were no more, but a teaching of Sinners the way how to be Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>fied; to wit, by living holily and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But the Word that follows in the Text; <hi>For he ſhall bear their i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iquities,</hi> Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the Throat of that Expoſition; for it is by Chriſts bearing of the puniſhment of the Elects Iniquities, and for paying of their Debt, that they come to be Juſtified; Therefore the one is given for a Reaſon of the other. 3dly. Conſidering the Word according to the meaning of it in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we take it for a <hi>Legal forenſick,</hi> or <hi>Court</hi> Word, borrowed from mens Courts, wherein a Perſon arraigned for ſuch a Cryme is either Condemned, or Abſolved; And when he is Abſolved, and Declared to be acquitted, or made free from that which is laid to his Charge, he is ſaid to be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; ſo is it before God, and in His Court: Juſtification is the freeing of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, from the Charge that the Law giveth in againſt Him, and the abſolving and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of him to be free from the Guilt of Sin, and from the puniſhment thereof, which by the Sentence of the Law is due to Him. The former two ſenſes run to the making of a man to be inherently holy, or without a Fault; Which is, as if a Guilty Man, or a Criminal, being ſifted before a civil Court of Judicature, were declared to be Innocent; But this true meaning of the Word, ſets out a Man arraigned before Gods Tribunal, and charged with Guilt, and found Faulty, but Abſolved, and Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not becauſe he wants Sin, but becauſe his Debt is payed, and his Sins Satisfied for, by a Cautioner; Even as a Man that is called before a Civil Court, for ſuch a Sum of Money, and is found lyable to the Debt; but his Cautioner coming in, and paying the Debt for him, there is both in Reaſon and in Law juſt ground, why that Man ſhould be abſolved, and declared free of the Debt: So is it here, Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus taking on, and ſatisfying for the Debt of the Elect, and procuring Abſolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion for them, for whom He payed the Price; there is Reaſon, and ground in Law, that they ſhould be Juſtified and Abſolved: All theſe Opinions agree in theſe two 1. That Men naturally have Sin, and that they muſt compt for it. 2. That this Juſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ification whatever it be, where it is, doth fully Abſolve and Acquit the Sinner, and makes him free of Sin, as to the Guilt, the Puniſhment, and Conſequents of it, Death and the Curſe, as if he had never had Sin: But the difference lyeth here, that this laſt acception of the Word, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves a Man, though he have Sin in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by the interpoſing of a Surety, and Cautioner, who payes his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the Sentence of Abſolution to him; And in this Senſe, Juſtification is, as if a Man were ſtanding at the Bar of Gods Tribunal Guilty, and having a witneſs of his Guilt in himſelf, and God, out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Mediator His Satisfaction, and Payment of His Debt, which He hath laid hold upon by Faith, does pronunce that ſinfull Perſon to be Free, Abſolved, and Acquitted from the Guilt and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin; and doth accordingly Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve him upon that accompt: So then Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not to be conſidered, as Gods Creating, and Infuſing of gracious habits in us; but the declaring of us to be Free, and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:152256:208"/> Acquitted from the Guilt of Sin, upon the account of Chriſts Satisfying for our Debt.</p>
            <p>This we will find to be very clear, if we conſider how the Word is taken, both in the Old and new Teſtament, as namely, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5.23. <hi>Woe unto them that justifie the wicked for a reward, and take away the righteouſneſſe of the righteous from him.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. <hi>He that juſtifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the juſt, even they both are abomination to the Lord.</hi> Where the plain meaning of the Word can be no other then this, that when a Judge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces a man to be Juſt, although he be unjuſt, it is a wicked thing which the Lord abhores. And ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>That thou mighteſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakest.</hi> That is, that thou might be declared to be ſo. And, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.19. <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her children.</hi> 2. We will find this meaning of the Word to be clear, if we conſider Juſtification, as diſtinguiſhed from Sanctification, For in that <hi>Popiſh</hi> ſenſe, they are both made one and the ſame; but they are diſtinguiſhed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified.</hi> Where he looks on theſe two Benefits of Juſtification and Sanctification as diſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct, and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the one of them from the other; now Sanctification being the Grace that renews our nature and makes an inward ſpiritual change; Juſtification muſt needs be that Act of Gods Grace, that takes away the Guilt of Sin, and makes Sinners to be friends with God, through Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and ſo is a relative change of their State. 3. It will be clear if we conſider to what it is oppoſed in Scripture; it is not oppoſed to ſinning, as Sanctification is, but to theſe two. 1. To the charging of a Sinner with ſomewhat unto Condemnation. And 2. To the Act of Condemning; now the oppoſit to Condemnation is Abſolution, as is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that juſtifies, who ſhall condemn?</hi> &amp;c. Gods Juſtifying is put in as oppoſit to the Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Lybelling of the Elect, and to the Condemning of them; therefore none of theſe can be; and ſo Juſtification there, looks both to the part of an Advocat plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and declaring a man to be Free, and to the part of a Judge pronouncing him to be Abſolved, and Juſtified; which well agrees to Our Lord Jeſus, who Juſtifies His People both wayes. 4. It may alſo be cleared from parallel Scriptures, where Juſtifying is called Reconciling; As 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world to himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed to us,</hi> &amp;c. And how that comes to paſs, is told in the laſt <hi>v. For he made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> So that to be made the Righteouſneſs of God is to be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and to be Juſtified is to be made friends with, or to be reconciled to God; and that not by working a moral Change; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Chriſt's Satisfact on, bringing us into friendſhip with God. So, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. Where to be <hi>Juſtified,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned, to be made <hi>accepted in the Beloved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And what elſe is that, but to be in good terms with God, to have him paſſing by all quarrels, as having nothing to ſay againſt us, but accepting us through Chriſt as Righteous? So, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39. <hi>Be it known unto you, that through this man is preached unto you forgiveneſs of ſins, and by him, all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could be justified by the law of Moſes.</hi> A place that clearly holds forth, that as all the Elect are naturally charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Law, as being Guilty of the breach thereof, and that they cannot be abſolved from it by ought in themſelves; ſo they are through Faith in Jeſus Chriſt freed from it: As if the Lord had ſaid, ye are fred from the Sentence of the Law, becauſe, through Chriſt is preached unto you Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins, and there is away laid down for your Abſolution, who believe, from the Guilt of Sin, and from all the conſequents of it. 5ly. It's clear from the Text, becauſe it's ſuch a Juſtifying, as hath in it Chriſts being Sentenced in our Room, as the cauſe of it; now He was Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced in our Room, not by having Sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:152256:208"/> in Him, which were Blaſphemous to think, but by having our Sin imputed to Him; and therefore our Juſtification muſt be our Abſolution, by having His Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe imputed to us, As is clear through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Chapter; Therefore its ſaid, <hi>He hath carried our ſorrows,</hi> and <hi>born our griefs; He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, He was bruiſed for our iniquities, by his ſtrips we are healed, He laid on him the inquitie of us all,</hi> And in theſe words, <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their iniquities;</hi> It's a Juſtification that comes to us by Chriſt's taking on our Debt; And this we cannot imagine to be otherwayes, but by a Legal Change, or by a Change of Law-rooms; He coming as Surety in our Room, and we having Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, by vertue of His Satisfaction; So that the meaning of the Words in ſhort is, As if the Prophet had ſaid, would ye know what we have by Chriſt's Sufferings? Even this, to wit, That <hi>many,</hi> as many as whoſe iniquities He bore, and ſatisfied for, ſhall be Acquitted, and Abſolved from the Guilt and Puniſhment of their Sin, through His Satisfaction; They ſhall be fred from the Sentence, and Curſe of the Law, which they deſerved; And ſhall be declared Righteous, through the Righteouſneſſe of their Cautioner, which they have laid hold upon by Faith.</p>
            <p>Hence, <hi>Obſerve,</hi> 1. That all Men and Women, even all the Elect themſelves, are by nature lyable to an arraignment before the Juſtice-ſeat of God; That they are Juſtified, ſuppoſes a bringing of them, as it were, before His Tribunal, ere they can be Juſtified, and have the Sentence of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution paſt in their favours; The Apoſtle takes this for granted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. <hi>We ſhall all ſtand before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt;</hi> And, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.29. <hi>It's appointed for all men once to die, and after that comes the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> There is a Solemn Decree paſt, That, as all Men ſhall die, ſo every Man ſhall be brought to a Reckoning, and Judgement; And <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. <hi>He hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day in which he ſhall judge the world in righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. and that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ranverſed; See, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>For we muſt all appear before the judgement ſeat of Christ,</hi> We <hi>muſt,</hi> There is an inavoidable neceſſity of it. For further clearing, and confirming of this, ye would know that there are <hi>Three</hi> Courts, that eſpecially the hearers of the Goſpel are lyable unto, which we would make our ſelves for; They are all put together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12, 15, 16. There is 1. The Court of the Word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God keeps a Juſtice-ſeat, or Tribunal, Condemning the Wicked, and Abſolving the Righteous: As Chriſt ſayes, <hi>John</hi> 12. <hi>The word Which I ſpeak ſhall judge you in the laſt day;</hi> And this is it that the Apoſtle hath in that forecited place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2 12. <hi>As many as have ſinned in the law ſhall be judged by the law.</hi> A 2. Court is the Court of the Conſcience; And this is more broad and extenſive, reaching all Men, without, as well as within the Church; Wherein God hath His own way of Lybelling and Accuſing of, and paſſing Sentence upon Sinners; As <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>When the gentles who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, theſe having not a law, are a law unto themſelves, which ſhew the work of the law written in their hearts, their Conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another.</hi> A 3d. Court, or Judgement-ſeat is that which is more Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable, Diſtinct and Terrible, And that is the Judgement-ſeat of God, when He ſhall conveen all and every one before Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf immediatly, and ſhall Judge and paſs Sentence upon them; Whether this be done to a particular Perſon, or to the whole World, as <hi>v,</hi> 16. <hi>In the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> We would have you confirmed in the Faith of this Truth, That there are none of us but we are lyable to all theſe Courts; And therefore ye would live ſo, as ye may be in a poſture fit for this appearing; many of us, alace, live as if we were never to be called to an account. And as if there were no Tribunal that we were to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That all Men and Women, even the Elect themſelves, are naturally,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:152256:209"/> and as in themſelves obnoxious to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and lyable to the Sentence of it before Gods Tribunal; for Jeſus Chriſt His Juſtifying of them, and procuring their Abſolution, implyes this much, That they, as conſidered in themſelves are lyable to, and cannot receive another Sentence then that of Condemnation; It ſayes that not only they have Sinned, but that becauſe of their Sin, they are lyable and obnoxious to Condemnation; That for their Sin, Gods Curſe is due to them, <hi>John</hi> 3.18.36. <hi>He that believes not is condemned already:</hi> And <hi>he that believeth not ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him;</hi> The Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is ſtanding againſt Him unrepealled; even that Sentence which we have, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them;</hi> The Sinner comes no ſooner to look to the Court of the Word, nor to the Court of his own Conſcience, but that Sentence is laid before him, And when he comes before God, he can expect no other thing, The Lord proceeding according to the Rule of the Word; So <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>We know that whatever thing the law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the law, that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world may become guilty before God;</hi> Which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons a lyableneſs to His Curſe, and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Judgement of God, as the Word is rendered on the Margent; There are none, as conſidered in their natural condition, who have a word to ſay againſt it: To clear it a little, ye would conſider two things in the Law, as it is a Covenant of Works, under which all Men are by Nature, 1. The Directive or Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of it, that carves out Mans Duty, and ſo it is the Rule of Righteouſneſs to Men and Women, and what is not conform to the Commands, and Directions of it, is Sin, and hath a Guilt with it; This is moſt certain, that the Law, even as to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, is a Rule of Righteouſneſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which they are to walk. 2. There is in it the Sentence of a Curſe, whereby the Perſon that Sins, is not only declared to be Guilty, but lyable to Gods Wrath and Curſe; This may be ſeperated from the former; The Law was no doubt a Law of Righteouſneſs to Man in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and is ſo to the Believer ſtill, who is Abſolved from the Curſe of it; but yet the Believer, as conſidered in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Condition, is not only Guilty, but ſtated under the Curſe; And this is the meaning of the Doctrine; That Naturally, not only are all Men Sinfull, but they are ſtated under the Curſe of God; The Law ſayes on the matter, Man and Woman thou haſt not abiden in what is written, and therefore thou muſt die, Thou art ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Curſe, which will light if it be not prevented: If there were any need of Reaſons to prove this, they are not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; It is ſo. 1. That the Lord may humble all Fleſh, as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>That every mouth may be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and that all the world may become guilty before God.</hi> 2. It is ſo ordered, that His Grace may ſhine the more conſpicuouſly; When the Perſon is found Guilty, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the Curſe by the Law, Grace ſhews it ſelf to be wonderfull, in pulling the Sinner from under the laſh of the Law; As <hi>Iſaac</hi> was ſet free, and a Sacrifice was accepted in his Room; So the Sinner is ſet free, and the Mediator in His Satisfaction is accepted in His Room; To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. <hi>God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded them all in unbelief, that he might have have mercy on all;</hi> Not that He ſhews mercy on all that ate in unbelief, but this is the meaning, That it might be mercy to all that ſhould get good of the Mediator, and alone mercy to the Elect, both of <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> It's on this ground, That <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. The Apoſtle not only ſaith, <hi>Ye were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes;</hi> But alſo turning it over on Himſelf, He adds, <hi>And we are all the Children of wrath even as others;</hi> Lyable by Sin to the Curſe of God, if it had not been graciouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 1: Let all of us take a view hereof our Natural Condition; and indeed it were the better for us that we were more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viewing it, What is it, will ye ſay? It is even this, Ye are all lyable to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before God's Juſtice-ſeat; Ye are all
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:152256:209"/> guilty, and by the Sentence of the Law, under Gods Curſe, and Condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; Becauſe God hath ſaid, <hi>He that ſins ſhall die;</hi> We are, I ſay, all thus by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 2. It gives a great commendation to the Grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus; it makes Grace wonderfully Glorious, That takes the Sinner at this ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k, and in this pinch; We ſhall not diſpute here; nor is it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nor edifying, whether God might have forgiven Sin freely, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervenient Satisfaction to His Juſtice, ſeing He hath declared His mind, concerning that in His Word, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.7. <hi>I will not juſtifie the wicked;</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 34.7. <hi>That will by no means clear the guilty;</hi> And <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>The day thou eats,</hi> or Sins, <hi>thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> This is it that puts Man as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, in his Natural Condition, to be as it were in Hell, while he is on Earth, and puts Him in ſuch a near capacity to the Wrath of God, if we may ſo ſpeak, and to the actual undergoing of it; That there needs no more but the blowing out of the Breath, to put him in the pit; yea, while He is living, he is a Priſoner in Chains, till the day of Execution come; If Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him not; ye would think much of Grace. O! how very much! if ye were ſeriouſly comparing theſe two together; to be ſo near Hell, and yet as it were, to have a Ladder ſet up for you to aſcend to Heaven by; And that in ſuch a way, as, by Chriſt's becoming a Curſe: They will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly never think much of the Grace of God, and of the Love of Chriſt, they will never think much of their own hazard nor wil they ever in earneſt make uſe of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, who have not ſome quick and lively impreſſion, and ſenſe of this their Condition by Nature; And therefore, when ever ye go to Read, to Hear, to Pray, to Meditat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Take up your ſelves, as naturally ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted before the Court of God, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to His Wrath; This would lay your Pride, and make Chriſts offers in the Goſpel lovely to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 3. This ſhews, That theſe who get any good of Chriſt, are much in Chriſts Debt and Common, and have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no cauſe to boaſt of it; If this be true, even of the Elect, that they are all once under the Sentence of Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, elſe they could not be Juſtified, and Abſolved by Chriſt; Ye that think your ſelves to be ſomething, what have ye to boaſt of? <hi>Who hath made you to differ, and what have ye, but what ye have received?</hi> It ſets you well therefore to be humble, and to put a Price upon Chriſt, as the Apoſtle doth on the ſame conſideration, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. When he ſayes, <hi>Who loved me and gave himſelf for me;</hi> That makes Him reliſh ſweetly to the Believer; And this is the ground of His Triumph, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea, rather that is riſen again,</hi> &amp;c. This way of Juſtification makes Chriſts death Wonderous Lovely, and it is on this that the Song of the Redeemed is founded, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Unto him that loved us and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and prieſts unto God, and his Father, To him be glory, and dominion for ever and ever amen;</hi> And of that new Song, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.9, 10. <hi>Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the Seals thereof, for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood,</hi> &amp;c. It is an evil token, when folk can talk at a high rate of their hope of being Juſtified, when, in the mean time, they have ſo little eſtimation of Chriſt, and their hearts are ſo little warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with love to Him, who is ſo Lovely to Believers; And when they can ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently make application of His Purchaſe to themſelves, and yet cannot tell when their heart was ever in the leaſt meaſure raviſhed with the conſideration of Chriſts love, neither did it ever reliſh to them, nor were their hearts ever in the leaſt ingaged to Him on that conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 4. All of you, who are lying in this Natural Condition, and know not what is your hazard, who are living in your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanity, or at beſt, in your Hypocriſee, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, Formality, not Regenerat, or Born again, but have ſtill the ſame Faith, and Love that ye were born with, and no other,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:152256:210"/> what is your poſture? ye are not in Chriſt, but lying naked, obnoxious to the Wrath and Curſe of God, condemned already; And what if your breath go out in this dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condition? What if a Palſie, or Appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexie overtake you ſuddenly? What if a Stone fall upon you, ere ye go home out of this place? There is even but that much betwixt you and Hell; Ye are lyable to be arreſted before the Court of Gods Juſtice, and how will it be with you, when ye come there? And when it ſhall be ſaid, that ſuch a Perſon hath broken the Law, and therefore Gods Curſe is due to him, and therefore away with him; For <hi>he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth according to mens works;</hi> Are there none of you afraid of this? Do ye believe it to be a Truth? O! that ye did, who are ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contentedly, and ſecure in your Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Condition, and yet it does not trouble you; Will you yet lye ſtill contentedly in this dreadful ſtate? Is it poſſible that ye can be well in this condition? though ye would heap up Riches as the Sand? ye cannot look into the Bible, nor into your own heart, but it curſes you; Ye cannot look to the Bar of Gods Juſtice, but the Sentence meets you, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed;</hi> This is the Truth of God; And if ye think there be any here lying ſtill in black nature (and we are not ſure all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed) think then upon your caſe, O! that ye ſaw your poſture; The Hand-writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting coming forth on the Wall, did not ſo afright <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> as this Curſe would afright you, if it were believed: And, 2ly. If this be your Natural Condition, and if ye believe it to be truly ſo, we would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulat with you, and even wonder, 1. How comes it to paſſe, that ſo many of you lye ſtill in your Natural Condition, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour not a change of your State; It will be wondered at by Angels, and by all the Elect; yea, and even by the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, that never heard of Chriſt, That ſo many heard the Goſpel, and had the offer of Chriſt, and yet did not ſtir up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to make uſe of Him: Is it not a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Folk can ſleep ſecure, under the Curſe of God, <hi>And bleſs themſelves, till their iniquities be found to be hatefull?</hi> To be in this condition, and to ſleep quietly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, will have a dolefull wakning. 2dly. How is it that ſo few take pains to try how it is with them? If many of you were ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a Decreet of an hundreth pound <hi>Scots,</hi> ye would not be ſo ſecure, till ye knew that ye were fred of it; And if it be true, that this is your Condition by Nature, to be under the ſtanding Sentence of the Law, and the Curſe of God, How is it, ye never try if ye be come out of that Condition? I aſk the moſt Prophane Men among you, were ye never under this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? If ye ſay not, the word of God will ſtand up againſt you, and ſay to you, that ye lie falſly; and if ye be under it, is it not hazardous to be ſo? But I fear, that many of you dream, that the Curſe of God, wears away as ye grow up. 3dly. Think ye never of coming to Judgement, and of Gods proceeding in Judgement againſt you? Think ye never that ye will die, and after death come to Judgement, according to the general appointment paſt upon all Men? How cometh it, that ye are not thinking on it, and what may be the Judges procedour towards you? He will Judge you according to this Word, and all that are out of Chriſt, and not Juſtified by Him, will be caſt into the Pit of Hell; There is no new Sentence to be paſt, or to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon you, but that which was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over your head before. 4ly. Know ye how long He may treat with you, or how long ye may be in Capacity to get your ſtate changed? Are there not many taken ſuddenly away, of whoſe eſtate we ſhall not Judge, but may it not be ſo with you? why are ye then ſo ſecure, why decline ye the Word, and refuſe to let it ſearch you, while ye know not whether the Curſe be removed, and whether the Sentence be changed, or recalled? Some of you, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will ſay, The Lord knows that, it is not for us to know; And that ſayes, that ye do never ſo much as eſſay to know, and to win to clearneſs about your ſtate: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of you, will it may be ſay, that ye hope all will be well, and yet that at the beſt is but a gueſſing, and ye would be loath to ſpeak ſo of a Decreet that were paſt againſt
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:152256:210"/> you, about a Sum of Money, in any poor Court of Judicature on Earth; and will ye ſuffer this terrible Sentence to ſtand over your head, in the Court of Gods Juſtice, and not ſtudy to be diſtinct, and at a point upon ſolid, and good grounds, that it is repealled? If ye did really believe that it was once ſo with you, and that yet ye are in hazard of this Sentence, ye would not, ye could not, I am ſure, ye ſhould not be at reſt, till ye knew that it were removed; It would put you to make uſe of Chriſt in good earneſt for your Peace, and to ſeek after an extract of the repealled Sentence, and of your Abſolution, Sealed up in your Boſome: And this is the thing that we aim at in all this, even that as ye would not have a terrible meeting with God before the Bar of His Juſtice, that ye would ſeek to have the Curſe that ye are naturally lying under, removed, and to have your peace made with God, and to have ſome well grounded clearneſs about it, that ye might live comfortedly, and die with ſolid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and Chriſtian Courage, without which ye can do neither.</p>

            <p>THE way of Abſolving a Guilty Sinner in the Juſtice of God, is the great ſum and ſcope of all the Goſpel; Even to ſhew how a loſt Sinner, Obnoxious to the Sentence of a tranſgreſt Law, may, without prejudice to the Juſtice of God, come to be Juſtified; we are perſwaded, that there is nothing of greater concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Sinners; And if we knew our Debt, and our Hazard, we would think, that there is nothing of greater concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us in particular: The Sum of the Covenant of Redemption runs on this, and it is the great thing aimed at, in all this <hi>Chapter,</hi> wherein the Prophet lets us ſee. 1. What is the great thing that Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Juſtice; And for this end much hath been ſpoken of Chriſts Sufferings, and <hi>Soul-travel.</hi> 2. He lets us ſee, what is the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that comes to us, by Chriſts Sufferings, and that is <hi>Justification,</hi> or Abſolution from the guilt of Sin, and from the Curſe which it deſerves. 3. He lets us ſee the way how this benefit is derived, And it is, <hi>by his knowledge;</hi> This, faith He, ſhall be the great reſult of Chriſt's Sufferings, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall be justified,</hi> And this ſhall be the way how it ſhall be derived to theſe many, and that is <hi>by his knowledge,</hi> or by Faith in Him, reſting on His Righteouſneſſe and Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>We opened up the meaning of the Words the laſt day, and pointed at two <hi>Doctrines</hi> from them. 1. That all Men, and Women have a Judgement to abide before God, an Arraignment, and Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, to which they muſt anſwer; They muſt all come to get a Sentence from God. 2. That all Men Naturally are ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Sentence of Condemnation; This is ſuppoſed here; For in as far as Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are only by Faith in Chriſt Juſtified; in as far the Sentence of the Law, and of the Covenant of Works is ſtanding againſt them, and over their heads, who are not by Faith united to Chriſt Jeſus, and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by His Righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>The 3. <hi>Doctrine</hi> (Which is almoſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Words of the Text) that now we intend to ſpeak to, is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That although all Men naturally be obnoxious to the Sentence of the Law, and to the Curſe of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet there is a way laid down, how a Sinner ſo obnoxious, may be Juſtified, and fred from that Sentence; and this is by Faith in
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:152256:211"/> Jeſus Chriſt only: If any Doctrine be of concernment for us to know, and to be well and experimentally acquainted with, This is of concernment to us; <hi>By his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many.</hi> There are <hi>Three</hi> things in this Doctrine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, which by one, and the ſame labour will be proven, and therefore we ſhall put them together. 1. That although all Men be naturally obnoxious to the Wrath and Curſe of God, yet He hath appointed away how guilty Sinners may be Juſtified and Abſolved. 2. That the way of attaining to this benefit of Juſtification, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the Curſe, is by Faith in Chriſts Righteouſneſs, It's <hi>by his knowledge,</hi> ſaith the Text. 3. That there is no other way by which a Sinner obnoxious to the Curſe, can be Juſtified, but by Faith in Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe allanarly. This laſt branch of the Doctrine ſayes not only, That there is no other mean to Satisfie Juſtice, but Chriſts Merit and Satisfaction; But that there is no other way, but the way of Faith to win to the application of His Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whereby many Queſtions may be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and many Errors in Doctrine, and Practice confuted; But our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is to ſhew, how a guilty Sinner may be Juſtified.</p>
            <p>And therefore we ſhall, 1. Give you a general view of the Truth of the Doctrine; by confirming it from Scripture, in all the parts of it. 2. We ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For Confirmation of the General Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, ye ſhall 1. Look upon ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, And 2. To ſome Grounds of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>As for the Confirmation of it by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, If we look through the Goſpel, it is Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt His own Doctrine, which He preached, and the way which He laid down therein, for Juſtifying and ſaving a Sinner, So, <hi>John</hi> 3. Where it is three or four times repeated, As <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him, ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life; v.</hi> 18. <hi>He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, becauſe he believeth not in the name of the only begotten Son of God; v.</hi> 36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, and he that believeth not the ſon ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him;</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>As Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs, ſo muſt the ſon of man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life;</hi> And that is all one as to ſay, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ſhall be Juſtified; <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi> Theſe are the terms on which the Apoſtles are by Chriſt warranded to preach the Goſpel, and to make the offer of Life to every Creature; And therefore if we look forward to their Preaching, we will find it to run in the ſame ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That there is a way laid down, through Jeſus Chriſt, to come by Juſtification, and Remiſſion of Sins. 3.

            <p>For further Confirmation of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ye would conſider theſe <hi>Four</hi> Grounds, and ye will ſee from them, good reaſon for it; Only remember this, That Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication looks alway to a Judicial Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour (as we hinted before) Wherein the Lord is, as it were on the Throne, and the Guilty Sinner at the Bar, pleading through Chriſts Righteouſneſſe and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to be Abſolved; which is even as if a Debtor were arreſted for Debt, ſhould plead for a Liberation, not becauſe he is not owing the Debt, neither becauſe he hath payed the Debt, but becauſe his Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner hath payed it for him; This being ſuppoſed, and remembred, ye would, (we ſay) conſider theſe Grounds, or Reaſons, for confirming the Doctrine. 1. The Sufferings that Chriſt hath endured, and the Satisfaction that He hath made, in the Room of Sinners, as the next Words hold out, <hi>For he ſhall bear their iniquities;</hi> And <hi>v. ult. He bare the ſin of many;</hi> Nay, this is the great ſcope of the Chapter; Therefore it's ſaid, That <hi>he hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows,</hi> and that <hi>the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all;</hi> This makes a Ground of Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. Conſider, How that there is not only a ſufficient price payed, but there is a Covenant of Redemption warranding Him to pay it, and accepting it off His hand as compleat Payment, and Satisfaction for the Elects Debt; And except there be a look had to this Covenant, Faith hath not a ſufficient Ground to reſt on for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Jeſus His Satisfaction, becauſe otherwayes we ſee not a Reaſon, why His Sufferings can be accepted for us; For, ſuppoſe, (if ſuch a ſuppoſition may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably be made) Chriſt to have Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet it was free for God to have accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that as a Satisfaction for our Debt, or not; But the conſideration of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption removes that Doubt, and gives Faith a Ground to lay hold on Chriſt's Sufferings, as Satisfactory to the Juſtice of God; becauſe, in the Covenant of Redemption, it's ſo tranſacted, and agreed upon, betwixt God and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; Therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.8, 9. and forward, from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. of this Covenant, ſhews, That when Sacrifices and Offerings will not do the turn, Chriſt comes in, Saying, <hi>Lo I come in the volume of thy book, it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O! my God; By which will,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we are ſanctified;</hi> And had there not been ſuch a Will, His Sufferings had not been uſefull to us. 3. Conſider the Offer that is made in the Goſpel to Sinners, which is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Faith; For the Covenant of Redemption is not the Ground, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Faith, though it clears the Ground and Reaſon of our Faith, but it's Gods Offer in the Goſpel, according to that place, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Go ye and preach the goſpel to every creature, he that
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:152256:212"/> believeth, and is baptized ſhall be ſaved;</hi> He warrands them to go, and make it known to all to whom they ſhall Preach, that there is Remiſſion of Sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to be had through Faith in Chriſt; and this is a Ground to Faith, when God makes offer of Chriſt's Satisfaction in the Goſpel, on condition that we believe, and accept of Him; When we by Faith cloſe with the offer, it gives us, as it were, an Aſſignation to Chriſts Purchaſe; The Goſpel ſayes, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38. <hi>Be it known to you, that through this man is preached to you remiſſion of ſins, and by him all that believe are Justified;</hi> And Faith conſents to that, as giving God credit, and accordingly cloſes with, and reſts upon it, as the ground of it's Plea before God; So that when the Queſtion comes to be aſked, What have ye to Anſwer the Law, and to pay your Debt with? Faith, or the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners Anſwers, I have nothing of my own, but there is a Satisfaction in Chriſt, according to the Covenant of Redemption, which is holden out, and made offer of to me in the Goſpel, and is given, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, for defence, againſt what the Law, or Juſtice can ſay; And I betake me to that; And this is the native and kindly Act of Faith in Juſtification, when it makes uſe of this Defence, and Truſts to it alone; This is even it that <hi>Paul</hi> hath, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.9. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>I count all things loſs, that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him;</hi> That when it ſhall be aſked, <hi>Paul,</hi> where art thou? I may have it to ſay, I am here, Lord, even in Chriſt, and in His Righteouſneſs; this is the ground of his Plea, having given up with his own Righteouſneſſe, as to his Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and he will have no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence but that. 4. Conſider the end of all theſe, to wit, of Chriſt's Sufferings, of the Covenant of Redemption, and of the Offer of the Goſpel; It's the Praiſe of the Glory of His Grace, that God may make it known, that He is Gracious, and freely Gracious, without reſpect to any thing in in the Sinner; This End is not only ſet out in theſe two peaces put together, one is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. <hi>To declare, I ſay, his right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, that he might be juſt, and the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of him which believeth in Jeſus;</hi> That he might be <hi>Juſt,</hi> That is, one that will fulfill His threatnings, and therefore He hath provided One to Satisfie His Juſtice, and One that is Faithfull in keeping His Promiſes, and therefore He is <hi>the Juſtifier</hi> of them that believe in Jeſus; The other place is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. Where, when the Apoſtle hath ſpoken of Election, Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and Adoption, he ſets down the end of all, to wit, <hi>To the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the beloved;</hi> And this is a Ground that makes all ſure; For God cannot fail to Juſtifie the Sinner that believeth in Chriſt, as He is offered in the Goſpel, becauſe that is the very end of His Juſtifying Sinners, the Praiſe of the Glory of Grace, which He will not miſs, but moſt certainly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruſtrably come by.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> are 4. in general, The 1: whereof is, for Information, and it's ſuch a Leſſon of Information, as without it, all the Preaching of the Goſpel is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and the hope of Eternal Life were utterly deſperat, if ſuch a Doctrine were not in the Goſpel, that through Faith in Chriſt a Sinner may be Juſtified; would any know then how they may be Abſolved; this Anſwers the Queſtion, and tells us that it is through Faith in Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and no other way; And if we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtedly believed the former two Doctrines, 1. That we muſt all come before the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of God: And, 2. That we are all obnoxious to the Curſe of God, we would think this were a very concerning Queſtion to be put, how ſuch a guilty Sinner may be Abſolved and Juſtified? And indeed, if we be not clear in this point, It's, as to any Fruit, in vain for us to Preach, and for you to hear, or to think of coming to Heaven; Which is in a Word, that a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner through reſting on Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, according to the Covenant of Grace, may come to be abſolved, and fred from the Guilt of Sin, and from the Curſe, as if he had never ſinned, nor been lyable to that Curſe.</p>
            <p>For further clearing of this <hi>Uſe,</hi> Conſider,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:152256:212"/> 1. What <hi>Justification</hi> is. 2. What we mean by Faith; And, 3. What are the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of this Juſtification ſpoken of in the Text. 1. By Juſtification in this place, is not to be underſtood, the making of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon perfectly holy, nor to have Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into him, for that is Sanctification; But it is to be abſolved, and declared free, in reſpect of the Guilt of Sin, and of the Curſe, as if a Man had never Sinned; As it's ſaid, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved;</hi> It's an Act of Gods free Grace, whereby our Sins are pardoned, and we accepted as Righteous in His ſight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as our Catechiſme hath it) as if our Sin had never been. 2. When we ſpeak of <hi>Faith,</hi> we mean not a General Hiſtorical Faith, that Devils, or Reprobat Men may have, and whereby an aſſent of the Judgement is given, to the Truths of the Word, though indeed Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith doth preſuppoſe that; neither by Faith do we mean ſuch a Faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man doth at the very firſt believe that he is Pardoned, and which puts away all doubting, and lifts him in his own conceit, to the hight of aſſurance, about the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the thing; It's the <hi>Antinomian</hi> preſumption, to believe at firſt hand, that I am Juſtified and Pardoned; But it's ſuch a Faith, that takes hold of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, made offer of in the Goſpel, that I may obtain Juſtification, and pardon of Sin through Him; According as it's ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>We believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by the Faith of Chriſt;</hi> It's an actuall cloſing with the offer of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, and a ſubmitting to the terms of it, for Juſtification; The Souls founding of all it's defence before God, on Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe offered to it in the Goſpel, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it, for Life and Salvation: As ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there were a Multitude of Rebels to whom Pardon were by Proclamation offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on condition, that at ſuch a time they ſhould lay down their Arms, and come in; and if one of them were challenged, and called to a Reckoning after his coming in, for his Rebellion; The ground of his Plea would not be, that he never was out in Rebellion, but that ſuch an offer was made, and that he did hazard his life on it; So is it here; A Sinner is a Rebel againſt God by Nature, and being in Rebellion, hath the Offer of Pardon, and Life made to him, on condition that he cloſe by Faith with Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth by Faith, give God credit, and hazards his Soul on that; Whereas unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief (to follow the ſimilitude) is, as if a Rebell hearing of ſuch a Pardon offered, would not think that a ſure way to come off, but would either plead innocent, or take him to ſome other ſhift; This then is the Faith that I mean of, which actually cloſes with, and makes uſe of Gods Offer of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, for Abſolution. 3dly. Conſider the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of Juſtification; And there are <hi>Three</hi> in the Words. 1. The <hi>Meritorious</hi> Cauſe that hath procured, and bought this Benefit, is Chriſts Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; His <hi>bearing of our iniquites; He ſhall juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi> 2. The <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> Cauſe, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or Mean, or Way, how that Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is derived to us; is <hi>Faith,</hi> called here <hi>His knowledge;</hi> It's the Faith we ſpoke of juſt now; Faith taking hold of ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and reſting on Gods Faithfulneſs for the making out of it; It's this which gives the Soul a Title to Chriſts Righteouſneſs, which formerly it had not, and makes Chriſt's Purchaſe of due, to belong to it, by vertue of Gods Offer, and conſequently, the benefit of Juſtification is derived to it, by it's taking hold of the Offer, which otherwayes it could not partake of. 3. The formal Cauſe, wherein Juſtification properly conſiſts, is this, even God's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving or Judicial pronouncing of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be Free, and His accounting of Him as righteous, on account of Chriſts Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs imputed to Him, and taken hold of by His Faith; where the Sentence is paſt, we need not curiouſly inquire; It's like, as the Sentence of Condemnation ſtands in the Word, while the Sinner is in unbelief; So by believing in Chriſt, He hath Abſolution in the Word, as <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth on him, is not condemned;</hi> And this Sentence of the Word, is as
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:152256:213"/> effectuall for Abſolving of the Sinner, as if the Sentence were pronunced in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat way, or with an audible voice from Heaven, by God, with the Sinners name, and ſirname in it; And therefore let me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this, with the other places I named before to you, that from them ye may learn to take up the way, how a Sinner is Abſolved, and Juſtified; It's Chriſt's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that makes the amends, and is the Meritorious Cauſe; It is Gods Word that makes Offer of that Satisfaction, and it's our Faith begotten, and quickned by Gods Spirit, that taketh hold of it; and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation it ſelf it Gods Abſolving, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of the Perſon, as Righteous in His ſight, who is fled to Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; And thus, though Gods Grace and Mercy, be the <hi>Efficient</hi> Cauſe that admits of the Ranſome; yet neither is Grace in us the <hi>Formal</hi> Cauſe; nor is Grace in God the <hi>Meritorious</hi> Cauſe, but it's that which layes down the way how a Satisfaction ſhall be provided, and accepts of it, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and of the Sinner on account of it, when by Faith he betakes himſelf to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 2. Seing there is ſuch a way of Juſtification provided, and by the Goſpel brought to light, revealled, and made manifeſt, as the Word is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. and 3.21. Since, I ſay, that Myſtery, which before was hid, is diſcloſed, and Life and Immortality brought to Light by the Goſpel, let me earneſtly intreat you, that ye would make uſe of this Mean, and way of Juſtification, for the obtaining of Abſolution before God; The end of Preaching (as we ſaid) is to reveal this Righteouſneſs, and the end of the reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, is to ingage Sinners to make uſe of it; Of which, though we ſhould Preach to you, from the one end of the year to the other, if ye do not betake your ſelves to it, ſo as to cloſe with it, and heartily to ſubmit unto it, it will all be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>For preſſing of this <hi>Uſe</hi> a little further, conſider the great concern, and moment of this Application, and what may induce you, ſeriouſly to mind it; And to this purpoſe, 1. I would poſe, and put you to it, if ye believe that by Nature ye are lyable to Gods Curſe, and that ye muſt compear before His Judgement-ſeat, and if ye be found in Nature when ye compear, that it will be a Woful, and Dreadful Sentence, that ye will meet with from God; and if withal ye believe this; that by Juſtification, ye may have Sin Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be Reconciled to God, and have the Curſe removed from you, and be put in ſuch a State, as if ye had never Sinned; If, I ſay, ye believe theſe things to be the Truths of God; is not this of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment? whether ye be made Friends with God, and have your Sins Pardoned, or not, whether ye ſhall be Eternally Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, or Eternally Miſerable, whether ye ſhall get Gods bleſſing, or lye for ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der His Curſe? If this, I ſay, be of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, then ſurely Obedience to this Exhortation, is of your Concernment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no other way to win to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, but this. 2. Conſider, That it's the very deſign of the Goſpel, and of this benefit that is made Offer of to you therein, which all the Nations that have not the Goſpel want; The priviledge being deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them: God makes Offer of a way to you, how ye may be Juſtified; and ye profeſſe your deſire to learn it, and to get it practically made uſe of, and Improved, and (as <hi>Paul</hi> hath it, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10.) That ye may know Chriſt, that ye may win Him, and be found in Him; And it is the Sum of the Goſpel, as we have it, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.38. <hi>Be it known unto you, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you remeſſion of ſins, and by him all that believe are juſtified;</hi> This is even the time that the Lord is making this Proclamation, that was before Propheſied of, and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by <hi>Iſaiah, By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many;</hi> This is it that is even now Revealed, Declared, and made Manifeſt to you, that by Chriſt Jeſus alone, Righteouſneſſe is to be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; And if it be of ſuch concernment, that for this very end, God hath ſent His Sone to die, and hath ſent this Goſpel to declare, and make offer of this benefit of His Death unto you; It's no doubt, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:152256:213"/> of your concernment, to make uſe of it, when it comes to you. 3. Conſider, That if the Lords Proclamation of it, have not that effect, to ingage you to Chriſt Jeſus, for the obtaining of Righteouſneſſe through Him, it will leave you in a wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then it found you in; It's not now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye will periſh or not? though that be a great matter (the moſt Barbarous <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> will readily think, that Gods Juſtice is terrible to meet with) but it layeth theſe two in the Ballance; It's either a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable condition, beyond what others who have not heard the Goſpel, will come under, if the Offer be ſlighted, or Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Salvation, if it be imbraced; <hi>Woe to thee Chorazin, woe to thee Bethſaida</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.21, 22.) <hi>For if the mighty works which are done in thee, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long agoe; And it ſhall be more tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable for Sodom in the day of judgement, then for Capernaum,</hi> who, becauſe <hi>they were lifted up to heaven,</hi> in reſpect of a glorious Diſpenſation of Goſpel-ordinances, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them not, <hi>ſhall be caſt down to hell;</hi> and whereon is this dreadfull denunciation founded? Even on this ground, juſt now hinted at, the Goſpel was more plainly and powerfully Preached to them, then it was to <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi> who had <hi>Lots</hi> Teſtimony, but Chriſt's and His Apoſtles Teſtimony, in a manner, ſwallowed up that, which Teſtimony they ſlighted: Now poſe your ſelves, whether this Goſpel hath not ſounded loud in your ears? have ye not heard it? yes verily; We may here allude to that Word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16. Doubtleſs ye have heard, the ſound thereof is come to you; and ye ſhall never have that to object, that ye heard it not. This Text, and this ſame Sermon on it, and others, will bear witneſs, that through Jeſus Chriſt, ye had a way laid down to you, for remiſſion of Sins, and for Juſtification; and what will follow? either ye muſt betake your ſelves to Chriſt's Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs for Juſtification, and ſtudy to be Holy, or elſe ye will bring upon your ſelves a more terrible Condemnation then came upon the inhabitants of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> who were conſumed, and burnt quick, by fire and brimſtone from Heaven; And therefore there is ground here for all to look well about us, what uſe we make of this benefit offered to us, that we miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not, and make not our ſelves moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, for ſlighting of it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here ſpeak a little to ſome ſorts of Perſons, that ought mainly to lay this to heart. 1. To ſome that are ſo utterly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and indifferent, in making their Peace with God, that to this day, all warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, threatnings, and diſpenſations that they have met with, could never prevail with them, once to make them that far ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as to aſk that Queſtion, what they ſhould do to be ſaved? to whom much preaching, is but a beating in the Air, to whom ſuch Preaching is Fruitleſſe, and Chriſt uſeleſſe; It's of theſe that He ſpeaks, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. Who being invited to the Wedding, <hi>They made light of it, and went away, one to his farm, another to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize;</hi> There is a Generation of ſuch Perſons amongſt us, to this day, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought ſeriouſly of the Goſpel, nor of this Doctrine, which is the Subſtance and Life of the Goſpel, and without which we can enjoy no Mercy, nor Benefit holden forth, and made offer of in the Word; But ſlight Pardon of Sin, and think little of Juſtification, who will, the day is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when it will be much thought of, and when many of you, if God prevent not, would give all the World for an Offer of it; and would be glad to be burnt with the World, or covered with, and ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered under a Hill, or Mountain, rather then to come, and receive your fearful Doom, and Sentence from the Judge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye had this favour in your Offer, and made not uſe of it. A 2d. Sort are a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Company; who, if there carriage be looked on, it ſayes plainly, nay, it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Proclames, that ſuch Men believe not, that there is a Judgement coming; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes they durſt not for a World, live as they do: Is this think ye, the way to be Juſtified, to be Laughing, Sporting, Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Tipling, and Trifling away your time? in ſpending it in Decking, and Dreſſing
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:152256:214"/> your Bodies, in beſtowing of more time, in one day on the Body, then ye do in eight, or many moe dayes on the Soul? To be glutting in the World, to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſires of your hearts, and the ſight of your eyes? Prophane as ye are, think upon it, for we declare even unto you, that there is a way how the ungodly may be Juſtified, held forth, and offered in this Goſpel; and if ye contemn it, God ſhall vindicat His Grace; and your trampling on it ſhall return on your own head. A 3d. Sort, are ſuch as have never taken with their Sin; nor with the fead betwixt God and them; We invite the filthy to come and waſh, Sinners to come and get Pardon; the Ungodly to come and be Juſtified; but, alace, we cannot get Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that walk under the due ſenſe of their Sin to Preach to; I dar ſay, that to many of you, the Doctrine of Juſtification is in ſome reſpect needleſſe, I am ſure for the time uſeleſs; For ye were never convinced of your Sin, nor of your hazard, but thought that ye were alwayes ſure of your Juſtification; ye never evened your ſelves (to ſpeak ſo) to Hell, God alwayes, ye think, loved you, and periſh who will, ye will not periſh; Theſe, and ſuch as theſe, have been your thoughts of your ſelves, and of your ſtate; And we have more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to get you prevailed with, to think ſeriouſly of making your Peace with God, then we would readily have in this, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with <hi>Pagans,</hi> or with Adulterers and Murderers, whoſe Natural Conſcience would ſooner be awakened then yours. Juſtification is not a ſerious matter to many of you, ye think to ſlip through Gods Judgement; If ye be aſked, whether or no ye be Abſolved? yes, that we are, will ye ſay, long ſince; But, ah! how came ye to be Abſolved? was ye ever Chaſed, and did ye ever flee for refuge to the Hope ſet before you? was ye ever purſued by the Law to Chriſt, and were ye ever made cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cloſe with Him, and to found your Plea on His Righteouſneſs? It will be ſtrange, if ſo many ſhall ſlip in to Heaven and never know how; we grant there may be ſome brought in, who have not diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned the manner how; but that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt whole Congregations, and Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſhould be made Friends with God, and never know, or at leaſt never kindly take with the Fead; we profeſſe we ſee not through it, it's to us an unintelligible Riddle, and a Paradox: Therefore be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to Reckon over again; Though there be a Juſtification, through the Blood of Chriſt, to be gotten, yet aſſure your ſelves, that ye are not in the way to it, while ye continue ſenſleſs of your Sin, and of your hazard. A 4. Sort are theſe, who think that they have nothing to do with this Doctrine, they are Rich, they are Wiſe, they are of honeſt Rank, and have a Name, and Commendation in the Place where they Live, and they have, may be ſome School-craft, and Learning, and therefore they are perſwaded, that they cannot miſs Juſtification; and where is there one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon amongſt many, if it be not ſome poor Body, even it may be poor in the World; that ever thinks that the Severity of the Law, or the Threatnings thereof concern them? But are there any moe wayes to Heaven, but one? Or is there one for the Rich, and another for the Poor? Do not all come in at this Door? is not this the way, even to take with your Sin, and to flee to Chriſt for Life? And yet are there not ſome among you, that cannot endure to think of Hell, to dread it, (or as we uſe to ſpeak) to even your ſelves to it? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye are thought ſomething of, able to do your turn, and have ſome parts, and abilities; but there are many more Rich, more Wiſe, and Learned Folk then you are, in Hell, that were never abſolved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, nor never ſhall; yet there is a propenſneſſe in Great Men, in Rich Men, and in Men of Parts to ſlight this Doctrine; But ſuch have in ſome reſpect, more need to give all diligence to make your calling and election ſure, then many others and yet ye go not ſo far as they do, who yet go not the juſt length. A 5th. Sort, are ſuch as never knew any inward Work, or exerciſe of the Spirit of God upon their Conſciences, but have lived with a ſort of wholeneſs of heart all their dayes; If any be called to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:152256:214"/> take notice of this Doctrine, they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to take notice of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>There is a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſayeth <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 30.12. <hi>which are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not waſhed from their filthineſs;</hi> They conclude they are Abſolved, but never look inward, to ſee if there be ground to bear that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. 6ly. And laſtly, There are a ſort that are Formal, and Hypocritical; They were never groſly Prophane, but they were as little truly and ſeriouſly Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; ye had need therefore, to take heed whereon ye found your Peace, and beware that ye take not the Form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe for the Power of it, eſpecially when the Form is come to ſo great a hight; And ſeing this way of Juſtification is holden out to you through Chriſt; we exhort and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you all, and eſpecially thoſe of ſuch ſorts as we have named, to look well that this Grace be not received in vain: In a Word, theſe two ſorts would take ſpecial heed to this Doctrine, 1. Some that mind not Religion at all. 2. Others, who if they mind it, mind it not in the way of Grace, but as it were by the Works of the Law; We declare to you, that Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THere is (as I ſaid lately) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of greater Concernment to a Sinner to know; then theſe two, 1. What it is, that ſatisfies Juſtice; and makes a Sinner acceptable before God? 2. To know how that may be attained, or what way it is applyed? And this <hi>verſe,</hi> ſhortly, but very clearly anſwers both. 1. That which Satisfies Juſtice, <hi>is the travel of Chriſts ſoul,</hi> or His Sufferings. 2. The way how this is Applyed, Derived, or Communicat, is ſet down in the latter part of the <hi>verſe, By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their iniquities;</hi> This is the effect of Chriſt's Sufferings, that many by them ſhall be Abſolved from the Guilt of Sin, and from the Curſe; And this is the way, how theſe many come to be thus Abſolved; It is by believing on Him, for thus His Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is accounted theirs, as if they themſelves had Satisfied. We propoſed the laſt day, this <hi>Doctrine</hi> to be ſpoken to from the Words; That there is a way through Faith in Chriſt, and reſting on His Sufferings, by which a Sinner, obnoxious to Gods Curſe, may attain to be Juſtified, and declared free before the Throne of God; This Doctrine implyes theſe <hi>Two</hi> things in general. 1. That there is ſuch a thing poſſibly attainable by a Guilty Sinner, as Juſtification. 2. That Juſtification is to be attained allanerly by Faith in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, reſting on His Righteouſneſſe. <hi>By his knowledge ſhall he justifie many;</hi> As there is a neceſſity to be Abſolved, ſo there is a neceſſity to take this way for Abſolution; becauſe this, and this only is holden out to be the way, how Juſtification is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; It's by Chriſts <hi>knowledge,</hi> which in ſhort is by Faith in Him.</p>
            <pb n="424" facs="tcp:152256:215"/>
            <p>We diſcourſed ſomewhat of the poſitive part of this Truth the other day; Which is of great Concernment; the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, being the very hinge of the Goſpel, and that wherein, in a ſpecial manner the Goſpel, and Coven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt of Grace differs from the Law, and Covenant of Works, and pointing out a way for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Righteouſneſſe, and Life through Chriſt; in oppoſition to the Law, as a Covenant of Works, that holds out a way to Righteouſneſſe, and Life, through our own performances.</p>
            <p>We touched alſo at ſome <hi>Uſes</hi> of the Doctrine, for directing of you, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving uſe-making of Chriſt, for coming at Peace with God; It would follow now, that we ſhould ſpeak a little to that <hi>Uſe</hi> of Refutation, that flows natively from this Doctrine; For if this be the way, and the only way of the Juſtification of a Sinner before God, to wit, by, or through Faith in Chriſts Righteouſneſſe: Then all theſe wayes that lead not Sinners to reſting on Chriſt's Righteouſneſs alone, for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Peace, muſt be inconſiſtent with the Goſpel, and ſo to be rejected, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, whether they be in Doctrine, or in Practice; And we chooſe the rather to ſpeak a Word to this, becauſe it will clear the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith the more; when we come to ſee, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe Corruptions, and Errors that are foiſted in by Heterodox Men, in this great Truth of God, to the Perverting, and Corrupting thereof; And it will the more provoke us to thankfulneſſe to God, who hath graciouſly delivered us from theſe Snares, Errors, and Corruptions; An Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and miſtake here, about the Subſtance of this Truth, being ſuch, as though we held all other Truths incorrupted, will ruine us.</p>
            <p>There are, we ſuppoſe, <hi>Four</hi> Sorts of Errors eſpecially, that contradict this grand Truth, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt Juſtification, by Faith in Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, to which we ſhal ſpeak a little. The 1. is, That old root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Error of <hi>Papists,</hi> who, in this Point, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nervat, and overturn the whole way of the Goſpel; And becauſe this is it that great part of the Chriſtian World hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded with; though it be in thoſe dayes, little thought of by many, and becauſe it is not one ſingle Error, but as it were a Chain of very Momentuous, and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Errors, We ſhall inſiſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> little, in laying it out before you; and ye would not ſo much look on it, as a controverſal, or meerly ſpeculative, as a groſly practicall Error, and ſuch as is naturally rooted in all Men; ye would alſo look upon it, with holy fear, and jealouſie over your ſelves, left inadvertantly ye ſlide into it; and withall, ye would look on it, and make uſe of it, as a Motive, to provoke you to love the Truth the more, and to be as I ſaid, the more thankful to God, who hath fred you from that dark, heavy and comfortleſſe way of Juſtification by Works, which is now impoſſible.</p>
            <p>It may be that this Error of <hi>Papiſts</hi> will not be thought much of by ſome; when they hear that they ſpeak of Juſtification by Chriſt, and by His merits, and by Faith, as well as we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do; But it's the more dangerous, that they do ſo; And therefore, ere I ſhew you their way of Juſtification; and the inconſiſtancy of it with the Goſpel, I would have you to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to theſe <hi>Three</hi> things. 1. That in this matter of Juſtification, though <hi>Papiſts</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the name, yet they do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the thing it ſelf; and ſo upon the matter, the Controverſie is not ſo much, what Juſtification is, as whether there be ſuch a thing, as Juſtification at all, taking it to be a thing diſtinct from Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and Regeneration; which they in effect deny; For if the Form Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Juſtification, and if to them, the Form of Juſtification, be the infuſing of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Grace in the Soul, then it's nothing different from Regeneration, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and therefore, when they ſpeak of Juſtification, they ſpeak of it in this ſenſe; For a Juſtified Perſon to them, is a Man renewed, and made Holy, even as to califie, or heat water, is to make that hot which before was cold; ſo Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, is to make a ſinful Perſon Juſt, becauſe of inherent Righteouſneſſe
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:152256:215"/> in himſelf. 2. When they ſpeak of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, they make of a two-fold Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The 1. whereof is, that which they call the Juſtification of a wicked Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or of an unrenewed man, when Grace is at firſt infuſed into him, which they grant a man cannot of himſelf <hi>condign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> merit: The 2d. is of a man growing, or increaſing in Grace, when he attains to more Grace, and to more G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ory; Grace and Glory being of the ſame Nature, (wherein they and we do not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,) And to this <hi>Second,</hi> Juſtification, they make neceſſary a Mans proper merit of Works; for they ſay, that the firſt Juſtification will not do a mans turn, who is come to age, though to a child it be ſufficient; becauſe their attaining of Glory, who are at Age, is the proper hire of their Works, which ſuppoſes Holineſſe; And therefore, when they ſay, that Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit procures Juſtification, their meaning is, that it procures the <hi>Firſt</hi> Juſtification, but not the <hi>Second;</hi> That is in effect to ſay, that it buyes habitual Grace, as a Stock to a Man, wherewith he may Trade; but when they come to ſpeak of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aven, and Glory, which is obtained (as they ſay) by the <hi>Second</hi> Juſtification, that is come at by the Mans own trading with that Stock of habitual Grace; And ſo the Mans Trading, or Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffiquing with his Stock comes in, as that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bich procures, wines, and merits the Prize. 3. Though they uſe the ſame names that we uſe, as of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi> or <hi>Remiſſion of ſin,</hi> yet there is very great dif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erence betwixt them and us, as to the thing; for they count nothing to be Faith but Hiſtorical Faith; which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils have; and for Remiſſion of Sin; They divide, and diſtinguiſh betwixt the removing, or remiſſion of the blot of Sin, and the removing, or remiſſion of the puniſhment of Sin; And they ſay, that in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Juſtification, the Blot of Sin is expelled, by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>fuſing of habitual Grace, even as Darkneſs is expelled by the coming in of Light; but as to the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin, they leave a Man to ſatisfie in part for himſelf, after his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now, (as we ſaid) Becauſe there is not one Error, or two here, but a Conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenation, or Chain of many Errors; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for further clearing of the Truth, and diſcovering of theſe Errors; Ye would conſider, That when the queſtion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, this is the great ſtate of it; what that is on which a Sinner may ground his Peace before the Tribunal of God Juſtice, as a ſolid Defenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They ſay, that it's inherent Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherewith a Mans Soul is Sanctified, Renewed, and made conform to the Image of God, which (ſay they) is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="426" facs="tcp:152256:216"/> this takes in but the guilt of Sin, which they ſay is removed in the <hi>First</hi> Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; They have a <hi>Second</hi> Juſtification, whereby they ſay that the puniſhment of Sin is removed, and whereby they merit Glory; And here came in their <hi>Dotations, Faſtings, Pilgrimages, Perigrinations, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby they make amends to God; and becauſe they cannot win to make a full amends here; They have their <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and <hi>Soul-maſſes;</hi> And ſo they have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God to Satisfie, for the wrongs which they have done to Him, but Heaven to procure by their own merits; for they lay down this a ground, that Glory in it's full being, the proper reward of merit, which, ſay they, is not founded on God's Promiſe, for that were to merit <hi>Congruouſly</hi> only, and not <hi>Condignally;</hi> nor is it found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Chriſt's merit, for that were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward His merit, which to them is abſurd; though they grant an intrinſick worth to be in both: But it's merit in ſtrict Juſtice on, and by which, they expect Heaven and Glory; and having Heaven (as we ſay) to procure by their own Merit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot thus Merit it, eſpecially if Mans Nature be looked on as corrupted; they invent two things, or forge, two divices for that. 1. To deny Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence to be Sin; And 2. To diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt Mortal, and Venial Sins; and Venial Sins they make to be conſiſtent with Merit, in which they take in a world of things, as not deadly; And if a Man have not Merit enough of his own, they have a Treaſure of Merits of many Saints, who have Satisfied for more than their own Guilt amounted to, and have merited more than Heaven to themſelves; And the <hi>Pope</hi> being by them ſuppoſed to have a right, and power to diſpenſe theſe Merits; he gives to them that want, a right to ſuch and ſuch a Saints Merits: And when all is done, they confeſſe that this way of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not certain; that it cannot give Peace; that it may be loſt, and that being loſt, it cannot be recovered, but by a new Grace gotten by the Sacrament of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: the very rehearſing of which things may let you ſee, how unlike their Juſtification is to the Goſpel; and to the way of Juſtification that it layes down; and what ground of thankfulneſs ye have to God, who hath not only contrived, but revealed unto you, a more ſolid and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable way of Juſtification: 1. Though their way hath much Pains, Labour and Toil in it; yet ye ſee what it amounts to, and how much Uncertainty, Anxiety, and Horror do accompany it, neither do they ever attain to Juſtification before God by it. And this is the 2d. thing we would ſpeak a Word to, even to ſhew that this way of Juſtification is inconſiſtent with the Goſpel; and that wherein a Soul can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have ſolid Peace nor Comfort, and we ſhall ſpeak a little to this. 1. In general, and then 2. More particularly: 1. In general, their way of Juſtification, is the very re-eſtabliſhing of the Covenant of Works; For it ſuppoſeth, that God hath conditioned Life to none, but on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Works, which in their value are Meritorious; It is true, they <hi>First</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to Chriſt's Merit this much, that He hath thereby procured this Merit to their Works. And 2. that He hath procured to them habitual Grace, to work theſe works; though (as we ſaid before,) they muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves for that Grace, but that doth not alter the nature of a Covenant of Works, ſeing the terms are ſtill the ſame: For conſider <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, he was to expect Life, according to the terms of that Covenant; <hi>Do this and live,</hi> and here the terms of the Covenant are the ſame, though their uſe be different; and if the Scriptures ſo oppoſes theſe two; That if <hi>it be of grace, it is no more works,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarly, then ſure this way of Juſtification, that puts a Man to the ſame terms of the Covenant that <hi>Adam</hi> had to expect Life by, muſt neceſſarily be inconſiſtent with the Goſpel; This will be the more clear, if we conſider, how they themſelves illuſtrat their Meriting by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="427" facs="tcp:152256:216"/> terms, then their Juſtification, no doubt, muſt be a Re-eſtabliſhing of that Covenant. 2. The Scripture ſpeaks of our obtaining of our Juſtification, and Righteouſneſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in this ſenſe, to wit, by Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to us, not only for coming at the firſt Grace, but for attaining Heaven and Glory; It's that which <hi>Paul</hi> leans to, when he comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>That I may be found in him, not having mine own righteouſn ſs, which is by the Law, but the righteouſneſs which is through the faith of Chriſt;</hi> He lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by the one, and betakes himſelf to the other, as his only defence, and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he doth ground his Plea before God; Now this being the Scripture way of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; and their way being quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare to it; (for if they were aſked, how think ye to anſwer before God? they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to ſay, by the merits of our good Works) It muſt needs be inconſiſtent with the Grace of the Goſpel; and that which <hi>Paul</hi> would by no means hazard his peace upon: We will find nothing more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned in Scripture, for the making of our peace with God, then Covenanting with God, the imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and Juſtification by Faith; But all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>heſe <hi>Three</hi> are here in their way of Juſtification, ſhut out, and excluded; For they have no ſuch thing as Covenanting, they ſcorn the imputation of Chriſts Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſſe, as but a putative and imaginary thing, and they cannot endure Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Faith.</p>
            <p>But 2dly, and more particularly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and conſider, how univerſally it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, and even deſtroyes the Doctrine of the Goſpel: 1. It corrupts and deſtroys the nature of Grace; for it hangeth it on mans free will, he muſt diſpoſe himſelf for it, and it gives him liberty to chooſe, or reject it as he pleaſeth; and it makes t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>at to flow from man himſelf, that ſatisfies Gods Juſtice, as if Remiſſion of Sins were not free; And in the <hi>Second,</hi> Juſtification and Admiſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on to Heaven and Glory. It utterly excludes Grace, and takes in Merit, and makes Heaven the proper rewa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of Mans own Merit. 2dly. It enervats the Merit of Chriſt, and His Purchaſe, though it ſeem in words to acknowledge it; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it neither admits of the Merit of Chriſt, as the Satisfaction to Juſtice, by which the puniſhment is taken away; nor to be that by which Life is procu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed; but it takes in Works, Satisfaction by Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Whippings, Pilgrimages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all that it leaveth to Chriſts Death, is the procuring of a new Covenant of Works, and the buying of a Stock of habitual Grace to Man to ſend for himſelf; but it layes not the removing of the puniſhment, on Chriſt as our Cautioner, in our name ſatisfying the Juſtice of God for our Sins, but it leaves it on our ſelves, and on our keeping the Covenant of Works; as that whereto the Promiſe is made. 3dly. It overturns the nature of Gods Covenant, for either it makes no Covenant at all, or it transforms the Covenant of Grace into a Covenant of Works; putting us to expect Life through the Merits of Works; For they will have no Promiſe of Life to be made on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts Merit, laid hold upon by Faith; but on condition of our own Works alone; For though they pretend that it may be called Chriſt's Merit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſay they. He hath procured Grace to work theſe Works; yet in effect their way of Juſtification, is to reſtore us to that Covenant which <hi>Adam</hi> had, and to ability to keep the ſame terms, though, as we ſaid the riſe be different. 4ly. It's inconſiſtent with our natural State; for it ſuppons Man before Converſion to have a free-will to good, and ability to diſpoſe himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Grace, and gives him a hand in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to God; as if he were not dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes; and ſo the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity of Grace is bounded, and limited to wait on a Man ſo diſpoſed, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing himſelf. 5ly. It deſtroyes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Gods Law, as if it were conſiſtent with His holy Law, to have ſuch and ſuch Luſts abounding within, and did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act a reckoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g for ſuch branches of it, as they call Venial Sins. 6ly. It overturns the Scripture Doctrine concerning Sin, for it makes many Sins to be in effect no Sins. 7. It corrupts and deſtroyes the nature of
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:152256:217"/> the Sacraments; and makes new Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that God never appointed; and gives them power to work that which God nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r gave them; as if the very works wrought did confer Grace. 8ly. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Juſtice of God; as if forſooth, ſuch poor Triffiles, and Toyes as theſe which they invent were ſatisfaction enough to his Juſtice; yea, as if ſome men could more then ſatisfie Juſtice, and could not only merit Heaven to themſelves, but alſo help to merit it to others; and as if God were bound in proper Juſtice to the Creature; and that not only on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Promiſe, but alſo, if not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the account of Merit of Condignity: All theſe things are involved in this <hi>Popiſh</hi> way of Juſtification, and inconſiſtent with the Truth of the Goſpel; And we have touched on them, to let you ſee, that it is not one Error that is here, but a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Errors; And truely, if there be not an abhorrency at <hi>Popery,</hi> becauſe of this groſs Error in Juſtification, there is but little ground to expect, that Men will keep at ſuitable diſtance from it in other things.</p>
            <p>And therefore, from what hath been ſaid, take a few <hi>Directions,</hi> as your <hi>Uſe</hi> of it; and if we were tender, it might do us good, now and then to get a little view of ſuch Errors. 1. Then ſee here the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of being more diſtinct, and clear in Gods way of Juſtification; in the way how peace is made betwixt Him and a Sinner, when we ſee how many Errors follow, and creep in after one Error; and when we conſider, how <hi>Popiſh Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are moving, and how this ſame Error which hath ſo many Errors with it, is ſtealling in, ye had much need to be well acquainted with the Truth, and to be guarding your ſelves againſt Errors, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when ſome lay ſo little weight on it, that they call it a ſtriving about words, which ſayeth, that there is but little abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the thing; I am apt to think, that the moſt part of them that are called Chriſtians, could not well tell how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Popery, Armenianiſme,</hi> or <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſme,</hi> if they were tempted to imbrace them, or any other Erronious Hereſy; And when withall we conſider, how naturally we are inclined to ſhuffle by the Covenant of Grace; and to cleave to the way of Works, or to turn the Covenant of Grace into a Covenant of Works; we would try well, what we incline to in this point, whether in our Judgement, or in our Practice, leaſt we fall from that which is right, in practice at leaſt, if not in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo: I intreat you to ſtudy this, as a main point of Chriſtian Religion; even that ye may know, and be clear in your knowledge of the way how God accepts of and juſtifies a Sinner. 2dly. Know that this Error of <hi>Popery</hi> in particular, is not of ſo little concernment as many think it to be; It's a wonder that Men ſhould think, differences about matters of Religion to be ſo light, and ſo little a matter, as if it were but the change of outward ceremonies, or of Words; Hence it comes to paſſe, that there is ſo little Care and Zeal to prevent the riſe, and ſpreading of Errors: We ſhal only commend to you <hi>Three</hi> things for guarding you in reference to this Error. 1. Siſt your ſelves often before the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Gods Juſtice, till your hearts be brought under ſuitable impreſſions of Gods Holineſſe, and Juſtice; of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſtrictneſſe of his Law; and of the neceſſity of your anſwering to it in your own Perſons, or in the Perſon of a Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner; And then conſider what will be your defence in ſuch a poſture. 2dly. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alwayes alongſt with you the impreſſion of your Original Sin, and Natural Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and of the ſinfulneſs of your Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; This will make you loathſome, and abominable in your own eyes, and Chriſt precious, and ſuch a Soul will not be in ſuch hazard of putting his own merits in the room of Chriſt's. 3. Think upon that which in Gods offer is preſented to you, as the way of making your Peace; Though ye would ſtudy Holineſſe, in order to that end, when ye are ſo ſinful, and when Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice is ſo ſevere; It looks not like the way to Peace; But when ye conſider Gods offer in this Goſpel, as it is held forth, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.38, 39. <hi>Be it known unto you men and brethren, that through this man
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:152256:217"/> is preached unto you forgiveneſs of ſins, and by him, all that believe are justified from all things from which they could not be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the law of Moſes;</hi> And the invitation that is given. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. to them <hi>that have no money to come and buy</hi> freely, <hi>without money, and without price;</hi> And ſee God tabli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g His call on another ground than your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe; and putting in your offer Jeſus Chriſt, and His Righteouſneſſe; It's a raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rouſing up of the Soul, to expect Abſolution before the Throne of God, on a more ſolid foundation; that will bear it's weight: We would beware of taking that way of Juſtification, and of making our Peace with God, that ſeems to be moſt rational like to our corrupt nature; for as many ſay, to be ſorry for Sin, to ſtudy to make amends, and to do what they dow, ſeems to be the moſt reaſonable way, and agrees beſt with our corrupt nature; but that is not it which will do your turn, but the way which God hath holden out; and that is, by His knowledge, by Faith in the Righteous Servant. 3dly. See here, how much we are obliged to God, for holding out to us the right way to Life; If ye look to many Nations abroad; the way to Life is holden out to them on this ground, even their own inherent Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, their own Good Works, their giving of conſiderable parts of their Eſtates, their Pennances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which yet can never quiet the Conſcience nor Satisfie Gods Juſtice; Yea our own Predeceſſours in this Nation were drowned in the ſame Errors; And we were as fooliſhly, and ſenſleſly ſuperſtitious, as the Inhabitants of any other Nations, before the Light of the Goſpel brake up among us; accounting ſuch and ſuch Sins to be do Sins, leaning to their Merits, to the Merits of Saints, to Indulgences, Soul-maſſes, Whippings, and a nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ber of things of that kind; And now that God hath mercifully fred us of theſe foolries, how much are we obliged to him? Hath ever <hi>Scotland</hi> been thankfull as it becometh for this mercy? We do, by our unthankfulneſſe, darken and obſcure the freedom of Grace, that by this Goſpel is preached unto us; And there needs no other evidence of it but this; That many are to this day as ignorant of the way of Juſtification of Sinners, and as abſtract from, and as great ſtrangers to the right way of making uſe of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs as if it had never been revealed unto them; or if they know, and can ſpeak any thing of it, all the uſe that they make of it, is to turn the Grace of God into wantonneſs; And, becauſe Holineſs is not the ground of making their Peace with God, to take the more Liberty to Louſneſs: Theſe are not Fruits of the Goſpel, other Fruits muſt be brought forth; or elſe ye will repent it, when ye cannot mend it: Let it therefore affect you, that God is ſo ill requite for His goodneſs; and ſtudy to be more thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Him, that we may ſpeak of theſe Truths, and diſcover their Errors, and that we are not Judicially blinded as many other People and Nations are. 4ly. Pitie them that are lying under darkneſs of their Deluſions and Errors, and pray for them; It's a ſore matter, that the moſt part of the Chriſtian World ſhould have the Name of Chriſtians, and yet ſhould maintain ſuch Doctrine; and lay down, and hold ſuch a way, as keepeth from benefit by Chriſt Jeſus; yea, as denyes on their matter, that He is come; For this is indeed the Spirit of Antichriſt, and of the Man of Sin, that takes Souls off from Chriſt; and yet how few make conſcience to pray for theſe poor people; and that God would purſue the whoore, and brake up, and ſkell that Market ſpoken of, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. And would diſcover His Truth, and make His Goſpel to be purely preached to them, that are fitting in the Region of Darkneſs, and in the Shadow of Death; ye would pity bound up, and impriſoned Souls, in this Error and pray for their reclaiming, and that God would keep this Land from it; It's an old ſeated, and rooted Error, and the reſt are but foolries, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it; This is the Devils great ingine and arme, others are but vapourers, to ſay ſo, which may tell us that ſpeaking, and hearing of ſuch a buſineſs is not altogether uſeleſſe: What if the day ſhould come, that all our Bibles, and every Engliſh
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:152256:218"/> Book that ſerves to hold out Truth, and to diſcover Error ſhould be taken from you, and ordered to be burned, and that Books ſtuffed with their Errors ſhould come in their room? Many of you think little, or nothing now of the Light and Liberty of the Goſpel which ye enjoy, but if Heaven be of ſo much worth, this Goſpel is of much worth to you, and this Truth of it in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. 5ly. Let not this Goſpel be preached for nought; O! receive not this Grace in vain; that is, this Grace offered to you in the Goſpel, and the clearing of ſuch Truths to you. O! What a challenge, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Guilt will it be, when we come before the Throne? when many other Nations will be condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they leanned to their own Merits, and made not uſe of Chriſt; and many of us ſhall be condemned, becauſe, though we profeſſed an indignation at theſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, yet we made no more uſe of Chriſt, than theſe, who by their Doctrine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Him: If our Predeceſſors could ſpeak, what could they ſay? Would it not be this, it is juſt that ye periſh, for ye had Chriſt, and His Righteouſneſs clearly preached to you, which we had not, and yet ye ſlighted Him: Therefore take hold of, and improve the opportunity, God hath clearly revealed this Truth to the Land, and to this Place, walk in the Light while ye have it, elſe your condemnation will be the greater, as it is, <hi>John</hi> 3.19. 6ly. Seing God hath given us this a ſingular mercy, even the clear Revelation of the way of Juſtification by Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Merits; Let us not, through our evil converſation, make the Truth of God to be evil ſpoken of, turn not the Grace of God into wantonneſs; It was an evil that ſoon aroſe in the Primitive Church, and which the Apoſtle diſputs againſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.3, and 6. Becauſe He preached Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Grace, and not by the Works of the Law, ſome were ready to abuſe that ſweet Doctrine, and to ſay, <hi>Let us ſin, that grace may abound, and let us do evil, that good may come of it, whoſe damnation,</hi> ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THis bleſſed Death, and Soul-travel of Our Lord Jeſus, hath been good news to many: and it is the ground of all the hope of Life that ariſeth from the Word to a Sinner; It ſhould never be taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, nor diſ-reliſhing to us, in mentioning reading, or thinking of it, but it ſhould in reaſon make Sinners glad, that ever there was ſuch a ſubject to be ſpoken of and to be conſidered; It behoved certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be a great buſineſſe, that brought the Son of God to die; The Salvation of Sinners is a great Work, though many of us think but very little of it.</p>
            <p>The Sum and Scop of Chriſts Sufferings and Death, are briefly holden forth in theſe Words, <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many,</hi> Where we have, 1. The great benefit that comes by His Death; which is <hi>Juſtification,</hi> or the Abſolving of Sinners from the Guilt of Sin, and from the Curſe of God, due to them for Sin; by Chriſt's interpoſing Himſelf to become a Sin-ſuffering, there is a way laid down, how Sinners may be relieved. 2. The parties made partakers of this benefit, and they are called <hi>many.</hi> 3. The way how it is derived to theſe m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We have ſpoken ſomewhat of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit it ſelf, <hi>Justification;</hi> which is the thing aimed at, for the moſt part in preaching, and in all other Ordinances, That God may by the Righteouſneſſe of His Son in the Goſpel, carry on the Juſtification of S n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, through their knowledge of Him, or by cauſing them to reſt upon His Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſſe by Faith, in order to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; It's ſad, that in this point, which is of ſo great concernment, ſo many ſhould go ſo far wrong, and miſtake ſo groſly; that it is no great matter in ſome reſpect, whether they be called <hi>Christians,</hi> or not; This being the advantage of a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> that He hath a way to Juſtification, and Abſolution from Sin, and Wrath before God, revealed to Him, which others have not; who, if he come ſhort of this, or fall in groſſe Errors about it, he hath little or no advantage beyond <hi>Heathens;</hi> who may have more of the Fat of the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rth, and of the things of the World, than theſe who are within the viſible Church have; But in this, in a ſpecial manner, the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> excells, and goes beyond the <hi>Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Heathen;</hi> That he hath a way laid down to him, how he may come to be reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, and freed from Wrath, and from His Curſe due for Sin; which we have ſhewed to be by fleeing to Chriſt, and by Faith reſting on His Righteouſneſſe, and Satisfaction; For Chriſt the Cautioner having payed the Debt, by laying down a Price fully ſatisfactory to Divine Juſtice; And this Satisfaction being offered in the Goſpel, upon the condition of receiving him; a Sinner giving his conſent to Gods offer, and cloſing therewith, may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently expect, according to that offer to be Juſtified; and no other wayes.</p>
            <p>We ſhew you one particular great and groſſe Error, wherewith theſe who are under the darkneſs of <hi>Popery,</hi> are wofully carried away, which we did the rather
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:152256:219"/> touch upon, becauſe, though it be a Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Error in reſpect of them, and diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, by them; Yet in reſpect of the practice of many <hi>Protestant Chriſtians,</hi> it's very riſe, and ordinary; that is, to Miſtake, Error, and go wrong in the way of making of their peace with God: And there are <hi>Three</hi> Sorts eſpecially, who do exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miſtake, Err, and go wrong here; Theſe of whom I mean, and am now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are not ſuch as are maintaining Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, or Writing for ſuch Errors; but ſuch as commit themſelves to be ſound Proteſtant Chriſtians, and haters of the groſſe Popiſh Error; That we ſpake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the laſt day: The 1.

               </gap>ſe, who, to this hour never laid down any ſolid Reckoning, how to make their Peace with God, or what way to come at Abſolution before Him; theſe Perſons do in practice deny, what ever may be their Profeſſions, that there is any ſuch thing as a Reckoning to be made betwixt God and them; or that there is a neceſſity of Juſtification, for preventing of their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruine and deſtruction; They live from their birth, with a hope of coming to Heaven, without looking how they may paſſe this great ſtep of Juſtification before God; they never ſaw, nor laid to heart their need of it; are their not many hearing me to day, that are of this number? who will needs keep up confidently their fancied hope of Heaven; and yet never knew what it was to anſwer a challenge for Sin, or a threatning of the Curſe, for the breach of Gods Law, from Chriſts Righteouſneſs, nor did they ever fiſt, and arraigne themſelves before Gods Tribunal, as guilty, nor did they ever think ſeriouſly of their charge, nor of their Summonds, nor of the way of making their Peace with God, by taking hold of Chriſts Righteouſneſs: A 2d Sort are the generality of Legal Profeſſours; I do not ſay, that they are Legal in their Practices; that is, that they make it their buſineſs to keep the Law, for they are as little concerned, or careful in that as any; but they are Legal in this reſpect, that when it comes to the making of their peace with God, they know nothing but the Law to deal with, as that man ſpoken of, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. That got the one Talent, and was utterly careleſs to improve it; yet when it comes to a Reckoning, he ſtands and ſticks to a rigor of the Law, Maſter, ſaith he, <hi>Lo here thou haſt that which is thine,</hi> juſt ſo, ſuch will be ready to ſay, we have no more Grace then God hath given us, we have a good heart to God; we are doing what we dow or can: Here come in Prophane Men, meer Civil Men, and Hypocrites, and more eſpecally the meer Civil Men; who do much in the duties of the Second Table of the Law, and they will profeſs that they do mind Judgement, and a Reckoning, but as if they had been bred and brought up in a <hi>Popiſh</hi> School, they foiſt in a Legal Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſſe in ſtead of Chriſt's, as the ground of their Juſtification before the Tribunal of God: ye may take in theſe inſtances of this ſort of Perſons, which are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and who, in their Practice almoſt in every thing agree with the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine. The 1. Inſtance is, of ſuch Perſons that know nothing of the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe, yet if we ſpeak of it, they will fall out in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as theſe; we can do nothing of our ſelves, there is no goodneſs in us, It's God's grace that muſt do our turn; yet in the mean time it is not Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they lay down to themſelves as the ground of their Juſtification, but the good which they have done, as they ſuppoſe in Chriſts ſtrength, and the Grace which is given them to work, and do that good by; which is the ſame thing with the <hi>Popiſh</hi> way of Juſtification; as if Chriſt had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured an ability to us to keep the Law our ſelves, in order to our being Juſtified thereby; hence they will Beli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="433" facs="tcp:152256:219"/> Righteouſneſſe, as the ground, or merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe of Juſtification; for the Grace given to us, enabling us to Work, is not Chriſt's Righteouſneſs but our own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe given to us, and working in us; and ſo it is alwayes our ſelves, and our own Righteouſneſſe, not Chriſt, and His Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſſe that we reſt upon. A 2d. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſome Folk, that ſpeak of Chriſt, and of attaining Life through Him; yet it is not in reſpect of His Merit, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of His Strength; for ſuch will ſay, we hope through Chriſts Strength to come to Heaven; their meaning wherein is, that He will help them ſo to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſo to be holy, and reſiſt tentations, as they ſhall come to Heaven thereby, as the deſerving cauſe of their coming thither; It's true, there is ſomething right here, when in it's own place, if whole Chriſt were reſted upon, Juſtification being put in the firſt place, and His Merit reſted upon for that; it were good that His ſtrength were leaned to, and made uſe of, for performing the duties of Sanctification; but when His Strength is reſted upon, as the alone thing; and when we look not to Chriſts Purchaſe and Merit, as the ground of our acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but to Chriſt as enabling us to do Duties to the end that we may give God a recompence thereby; at the beſt it is but He and we together, this certainly is wrong; for nothing is propoſed as a Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Gods Juſtice here, but what is immediately our own. A 3d. Sort are ſomewhat wiſer, who, it may be, think that any thing that is in themſelves, is not worth the naming; but partly through Chriſts Merit, and partly through what they have, and can do themſelves; or by theſe joyned together, they hope to be ſaved. This was the Doctrinal Error of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who attributed Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt, and to the Works of the Law joyntly: This way aſcribs to Chriſts Righteouſneſſe this much, that it makes our own Righteouſneſſe to be accepted, as the ground of our Juſtification before God; which in ſome reſpect is worſe then the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works; for the Covenant of Works ſought a perfect Righteouſneſſe, but this way offers an imperfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to mend, and to eke out our imperfect Righteouſneſs, it takes in the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; but there is no ſuch Covenant, or way of Juſtification in Scripture: for God made but two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants for men to attain Life by, one of <hi>Works,</hi> which is now impoſſible; The other of <hi>Grace,</hi> by which only it is poſſible to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Juſtification and Life: This makes a third Covenant, or Contrivance by a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture party of ſome Works in us, and partly of ſome Grace in Chriſt, to make up what is inlaking in our Works; and yet this way is very pleaſing to our nature, and that to which we are much inclined for Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for men are naturally diſpoſed to think that they give Chriſt enough, when they allow His Righteouſneſs, to make up what is defective in their own; It's true indeed, that Chriſts Merits do waſh our Duties, but our Duties come never up to be the ground of our Juſtification in whole, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in part; which is evident from this, that ere Chriſt make our Duties, or Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances acceptable, He makes our Perſons firſt to be accepted; and that once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then any thing performed by us, in Chriſt's ſtrength according to the will of God, is acceptable alſo.</p>
            <p>But now we proceed further in the Words of the Text; and before we come to the cauſes of our Juſtification, we ſhall briefly <hi>Obſerve</hi> two or three things, that lye obviouſly in our way; The 1. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this, That the Abſolving of a Sinner, through the imputation of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, is the proper, and native re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of Chriſts Purchaſe; and the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of it; His Sufferings, and Soul-travel were undergone, to procure Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to <hi>many;</hi> So that if we would know what is the Fruit of Chriſts Soul-travel? here it is; <hi>By his knowledge ſhall many be justified;</hi> Therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. It's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to his Blood, <hi>Being juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath,</hi> and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. He was made ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God through him;</hi> That which I mean is this, That Chriſts intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:152256:220"/> in His dying, was to redeem, and, really, and actually to procure Abſolution, and Juſtification before the Throne of God to ſo many as ſhould believe on Him: Or we may take the Doctrine theſe two wayes, which yet come both to the ſame account, 1. Thus, that the things which Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Death, was not a meer pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, that Sinners might be Juſtified; nor to lay down a conditional way of their Juſtification, whereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that which He intended was that their Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ification might follow abſolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; I do not mean inſtantly, and without the interveening of a condition; For here His <hi>knowledge</hi> comes in, as the condition, but that which I mean is, that He di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, that their Juſtification might actually, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly follow as a fruit of His Purchaſe; In a word, His Death and Sufferings were, not to make Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ification poſſible to all, but that ſo many as He bargained for might be abſolutely Juſtified; or that <hi>many</hi> that is, all the Elect might be actually Juſtified; becauſe <hi>He ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l bear their iniquities,</hi> therefore by His knowledge they ſhall be Juſtified.</p>
            <p>We <hi>Obſerve</hi> it for theſe <hi>Ends,</hi> or <hi>Uſes,</hi> 1. To give an anſwer to that queſtion, What is the native reſult of Chriſts Death to His People? we ſay, it is their abſolute, and actual Juſtification: Theſe that would extend the Grace of God, and the Death of Chriſt ſo broad and wide, as to leave out none, ſay in effect, that the deſign thereof was to lay down ſuch a way, as makes it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to all to be Juſtified; and yet ſuch a way as makes it poſſible that none at all ſhall be juſtified; for it hirgs juſtification on the free will of the creature; &amp; ſo in ſtriving to make Grace broader then God allows, they come to make it none at all, by leaving it on mans freewill, whether it ſhall be effectual or not, But bleſſed be God, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God was not on theſe terms, for it is ſaid here, <hi>That by his knowledge he ſhall juſtifie many.</hi> 2. It gives us theſe two practical <hi>Uſes.</hi> 1. It ſhews, what ſhould be our intendment, in our Uſe-making of Chriſts Death, and that is, that we may be Juſtified, and Abſolved by it, even to make uſe of it, for attaining to Pardon of Sin, and Peace with God; If this be over-looked, and neglected, all other Fruits of it were uſeleſſe; it will avail but little to be a Member of the viſible Church, to be Baptized, and to be admitted to the Lords Supper, to have Litural knowledge, of the principles of Religion, to have a Gift of Preaching, or of Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe will not Juſtifie; The peculiar thing aimed at in Chriſts Death, and that which His People aim at, and have to rejoyce in, is <hi>Justification through his knowledge,</hi> which is alwayes to be underſtood without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the ſtudy of Holineſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It gives us this <hi>Uſe,</hi> whoever would have Abſolution before God, would know that this was the very thing ingaged for to Chriſt, and His intendment in His Death; That Sinners believing on Him, might be Abſolutely, and Actually Juſtified by Him; it was not ſimply to propoſe Juſtification to them; but that Abſolutely they might be Abſolved from the Curſe of God due to them for Sin: And now may I not aſk, whether this is more encouraging to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to have Chriſt procuring Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only conditionally to them; or to have the thing abſolutely conferred upon them? This is a ground whereupon believing Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners lift up their heads confidently, and expect Juſtification through His Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: It is this that was promiſed to Chriſt, and it is this that is the native fruit of His Death, without which it will be fruitleſſe; And this may remove the great obſtruction that readily a Sinner, when he is ſerious, ſeeth lying in his way, to wit, the want of Righteouſneſſe, and the fear of not being Abſolved, the want of inherent Righteouſneſſe in himſelf, which makes him lyable to the Curſe of the Law; when he ſeeth upon what terms Chriſt died, <hi>Firſt,</hi> To procure a Righteouſneſſe to them that wanted Righteouſneſſe. And 2. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe terms, that Sinners through faith in Him might he Juſtified, and fred from the Guilt of Sin, as if they never had Sin themſelves; Conſidering this to be his intendment, according to the terms of the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:152256:220"/> Covenant of Grace, what have they, or what can they have to ſkar or fright them from expecting the fulfilling of this Promiſe? Becauſe the contryvance of the Covenant of Redemption, is to buy Juſtification ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, and not the poſſibility of it only, nor to buy Grace to us, whereby to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our ſelves, but Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ification it ſelf, ſo as we may be beholden to Him alone for it.</p>
            <p>Again. 2dly. When we ſay that the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a Sinner, is the proper reſult of Chriſt's Death, it may be thus underſtood; That the Righteouſneſſe whereby a Sinner is Juſtified, is immediatly Chriſt's Death and Purchaſe, as to the meritorious cauſe thereof; to that if we look to what Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a Sinner, as to the meritorious cauſe of it; the knitting of theſe two together, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied;</hi> and <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many,</hi> doth hold it forth, to be Chriſt's Death and Purchaſe; The travel of His Soul is, and muſt be the ground on which a loſt Sinner is Juſtified before the Throne of God; This both confirms what we formerly propoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and alſo ſhews that the Juſtification of a Sinner is not by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Holineſſe; whence comes it, I pray that makes a Sinner acceptable before God? It is not from habitual, nor actual inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Grace, but from Chriſts Righteouſneſs, laid hold on by Faith, that grippeth and adhereth to it; But from the latter part of the Words, we will have more particular occaſion to ſpeak to this, where theſe two are knit together; <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their iniquity;</hi> therefore we do now paſſe it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Object</hi> of this benefit is <hi>many, many,</hi> ordinarily in Scripture implyes theſe two things. 1. A great number, and ſo it ſhews the extent of the Object; that is, that Chriſt ſhall purchaſe and redeem many; or by His Death procure Juſtification to many. 2. A reſtriction, and thus <hi>many</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>all,</hi> and ſo the meaning is; There ſhall many be Juſtified by Chriſt's Death, but not all; and therefore, as none can from theſe Words plead for an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality in Juſtification; So neither can they in Redemption, for he only bare their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, whom by His knowledge He Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.</p>
            <p>Looking on theſe <hi>many,</hi> in theſe twofold conſiderations; we may take theſe <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> from it. 1. Taking it extenſively, <hi>Obſerve.</hi> 1. That the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is of it ſelf able to Juſtifie many; It's a Righteouſneſſe that can Satisfie for the Sins of many; or thus, That in the Covenant of Redemption, there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Application of Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Purchaſe to many. 2. That there are many, who ſhall indeed partake of Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe, and be Juſtified by it; It's not one, or two, or a thouſand; but as it was intended to Juſtifie <hi>many,</hi> ſo it ſhall be actually applyed <hi>to many,</hi> for their Juſtification. 3. Comparing, the former Words, He <hi>ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied;</hi> with theſe Words, <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many, Obſerve,</hi> That Chriſt is not ſatisfied for the Travel of His Soul, except many be Juſtified; Or thus, It is Chriſt's Satisfaction, how many there be that make uſe of Him, and that by making uſe of Him, come to be juſtified by Him; as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward we will ſee; Theſe many, are all theſe that believe, all theſe that have this true and ſaving knowledge of Him, and do rightly acknowledge Him.</p>
            <p>The making out of one of theſe Doctrines will make them all out; That Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe is able to Juſtifie many, that many ſhall be Juſtified by it; and that it is His S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tisfaction, and Delight that many be Juſtified, and get this good of it; It's ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. That <hi>he came to lay down his life a ranſome for many,</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15. That <hi>the gift of grace which is by one man Jeſus Christ hath abounded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many.</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>As by one mans diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> many be made righteous;</hi> Let but theſe <hi>Four</hi> things be put together, and conſidered, and it will be found, that there is no juſt ground to quarrel theſe Doctrines. 1. The native worth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:152256:221"/> value that is in the Satisfaction of Chriſt, It's <hi>the blood of God,</hi> of the Perſon that is God; It's an Offering that flows from a willing and cheerful Giver; which makes it the more acceptable; He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with delight to pay the Price, there cannot be a limiting, or bounding of this Worth and Value; becauſe there cannot be any bounding, or limiting of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that gives the Value to it, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in it ſelf. 2. Conſider the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Offer, which takes in <hi>many,</hi> Our Lord communicats very freely, what He hath bought very dear: and it's done with reſpect to His taking in of many, to take away all exceptions from the poor and needy, and from them that want money. 3. As the terms are free, ſo the Offer is very broad; and comprehenſive, as we ſee, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho every one that thirsts come to the waters;</hi> and <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will let him come, and take of the water of life freely;</hi> And we find theſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>all that believe,</hi> and, <hi>whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,</hi> to be frequently uſed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which takes in all that will yeeld themſelves to Him on the terms of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to cloſe the bargain with Him. 4. Conſider God's end in the Juſtification of Sinners; which is to make His Grace to ſhine, and to triumph, and to make it's victory over mans Sin Conſpicuous, and Glorious, by being beyond it; not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the number of Perſons, but in this reſpect; that as <hi>Adams</hi> one Sin brought Death on many; ſo the Death of Chriſt hath brough Juſtification to many; as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>The judgement was by one to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but the free gift is of many offences unto juſtification;</hi> Whereas <hi>Adams</hi> one Offence brought Death on many; here the relieving of one Sinner is the procuring of freedom to many, becauſe, in that reſpect Chriſt is a Satisfaction for many Offences: But it may be <hi>Objected</hi> here; is it not ſaid, that the way to Heaven <hi>is strait, and few their be that enter in thereat:</hi> They are thin ſown, to ſay ſo, that are Heirs of this Inher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ny; or they are ſimply many, though comparatively but few; Conſider, and Compare them with the multitude of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probats that are even in the viſible Church, they are few, yet if ye will conſider them in themſelves, they are many; and it's moſt true that is ſpoken, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.9. <hi>I ſaw a number which no man could number;</hi> if we look ſince the beginning: of the World, how ſome are taken in this Age, and ſome in that, ſome of this Nation, and ſome of another; they will be found to be but few, when all of all Nations are put together, yet in themſelves they are many: There are theſe <hi>three Uſes</hi> of it, which may be Reaſons why it is put in here. The 1. is, to let us ſee the largeneſs of the extent of the worth of Chriſt, and of the allowance of Grace, in reference to the Juſtification of Sinners through Him; which ſhould make us ſtand, pauſe, and wonder: It had been much, if Grace had ſaved but one, more if it had ſaved a thouſand, or twenty thouſand: But O! what ground of admiration is it, when many are ſaved by it; This is the native end, why it is put in here; even to ſhew, that it is not for nought that Chriſt died, It ſhall be a bleſſing to many, I marke it, becauſe, though the preſumptuous thoughts of many lead them to extend the Merits of Chriſt to all in the viſible Church; yet it may be that in others there are too narrow, and limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts of the extent of His Merits, and of the allowance of Grace, as to the number of the Elect, that ſhall be ſaved: It being certain, that as we are in hazard and ready to abuſe any thing ſo this, if it be ſaid that they are <hi>many</hi> that are Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: we are ready to exclude none, and if it be ſaid that they are <hi>few,</hi> we are ready to make Grace as it were an a nigard, and Churle, and to contract, and narrow too much the application of it.</p>
            <p>The 2d. <hi>Uſe</hi> of it (Which is a Second Reaſon why this Word <hi>many,</hi> is put in here) may ſerve for encouragement to Sinners: and to hearten them to aſſay to get this benefit of Juſtification made their own: many trow (and in ſome reſpect it is a truth) that it's a ſingular and odd thing to come by Juſtification; and hence they
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:152256:221"/> conclude, that they will never get it; and indeed if the thought of it's Singularity and Rareneſs made them careful to win at the thing, it were an profitable uſe of it; but when it makes them heartleſſe, to attain the thing; it's a wrong, and prejudicial uſe of it; But Sinners, there is here ground of Encouragement, Provocation, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirring to you, to ſeek after Juſtification through Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe there are <hi>many,</hi> that are the Objects of it; The Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, is a Righteouſneſs that will ſave <hi>many;</hi> It's an Article of the Covenant of Redemption, that Chriſt ſhall get <hi>many;</hi> the Promiſe will give Title and Right to <hi>many,</hi> He will not be content, if He get not <hi>many;</hi> now putting theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it cannot but be very great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to ſeek, and a ſtrong ground to expect Juſtification on this account, becauſe, 1. That which a believing Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner gets, is Juſtification, Pardon of Sin both Original and Actual; and it's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat actual Juſtification, not only the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Offer of it, but the Application of it, <hi>Justification from all things, from which we could not be justified by the law of Moſes;</hi> and Juſtification never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed. 2. This Juſtification is deſigned for, and allowed to <hi>many,</hi> the ſtepping in of ſome before others doth not wrong them; and there needs not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puts about Election; for the Text ſayes, that the allowance of Grace is to <hi>many.</hi> 3. It is Chriſt's Satisfaction that He get many to be Juſtified; and the moe that ſtep to, to lay hold on this benefit; He hath as it were the more Satisfaction: And if the Sinner ſhould ſay, I know not if I be included in that number; the terms of the Covenant run to all that believe; if there be a fleeing to Chriſt, by Faith for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, there needs not be anxious diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether the Sinner will come ſpeed; but there ſhould be a ſteping forward, <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> have gotten good, and <hi>many</hi> will get good, and there is room ſufficient for as many as will yeeld themſelves up to Chriſt, and reſt upon His Righteouſneſſe, It's a large mantle that covers thouſands; and the Lord will have thouſands to be hidden under it, and Juſtifyed by it.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It ſerves to be a moſt terrible ground of inexcuſableneſs to theſe, to whom Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe is ſpoken of, and offered in the Goſpel; who yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect to make uſe of it; that He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to lay down His Life, and that as a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for many; none needs to ſay, I knew not if I will be welcome, He ſaid, it was for <hi>many,</hi> and though He ſaid not it was for <hi>all,</hi> yet it's for <hi>all</hi> that will believe in Him; And therefore it is not, nor ſhall not, becauſe He hath confined the benefit to few, that ye are, or ſhall be excluded; but becauſe, though He extended the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to <hi>many,</hi> yet ye excluded your ſelves; and none of you, who hear this Goſpel, ſhall have it to ſay, I betook my ſelf to Chriſt by Faith, but He refuſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of me, and He would have no moe then He had; there are many who pleaſe themſelves with ſuch a Word as this, when they hear that many will be ſaved; But it will be the deareſt bought Doctrine that ever ye heard; it had been in ſome reſpect better, that ye had heard that it was but two or three that will come to Heaven; becauſe the hearing of <hi>many's</hi> coming thither will greatly aggravat your guilt, who neglect ſo great a Salvation.</p>
            <p>Therefore take two or three <hi>Caveats</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> And 1. Beware of being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, becauſe there are <hi>many</hi> that ſhall be Juſtified; There are many moe that will periſh; compare theſe that periſh with theſe that will be ſaved; and it will be found that they are but an handful that will be ſaved, and that Swarms and Multitudes will go to Hell; Therefore, when ye hear that the door is opened to many, let it encourage you to enter in; but remember this, that moe will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and periſh, then will enter in and be ſaved: The Scripture ſayes, <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen;</hi> even in reſpect of the called within the viſible Church. 2. Conſider that Graces inlarging of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, to take in many, will be your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt challenge and aggravation that ſhall miſs, and come ſhort of it, <hi>Therefore, let us</hi> (as it is, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:152256:222"/> any of as ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it;</hi> When this door is opened to us, we would by all means fear coming ſhort, or not entring through unbelief; for it will be worſe with us then if the door had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been opened; Folk ordinarily think not ſo much to miſs, or come ſhort of a Priviledge which but one or two have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to, but when it is ſuch a priviledge as is made attainable by <hi>many,</hi> the miſſing of it galleth and tormenteth the more; and when <hi>many</hi> ſhall come from the Eaſt, Weſt, South and North, and ſhall ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Kingdom of Heaven, what weeping and gnaſhing of teeth will it cauſe to them, who ſhall be ſecluded? And therefore, 3ly. Beware of thinking that there is the leſs diligence, or fear required, becauſe we ſay, that <hi>many</hi> will be Juſtified; for though there be <hi>many</hi> that are Redeemed, and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> that ſhall be Juſtified, yet all theſe come to be Juſtified through Chriſt's <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi> And therefore ſuch as are ignorant and prophane can but take little, or no comfort hence, while they continue to be ſuch; Though there be <hi>many</hi> that are Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, yet none but Believers are Juſtified; and none can warrantably look on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Believers, but ſuch as are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ſtudents of Holineſſe; I would not, therefore have you laying weight, either on <hi>many,</hi> or <hi>few's</hi> being Juſtified, except by way of Motive; but on the way that ye take to come by the end: Though a great many moe were ſaved then will be; if ye take not the way of Faith, and Holineſſe to come to Salvation, ye will not get your ſelves ſhrouded in the croud, but though there were never ſo few damned, ye ſhall make up the number; In a word, it's ground of encouragement to a poor Sinner, that would fain be Juſtified in God's own way; it is alſo ground of ſhame, and confuſion of Face to the unbeliever, that reſtrains the benefit of Chriſt's Purchaſe, and ſhuts himſelf out; when Grace doth make uſe of ſuch expreſſions to bring him in; and it will be ground of conviction to all that have ſo wide a door opened to them, and do not ſtrive to enter in: It may be many of you think little of this now, but in that day, when <hi>many</hi> ſhal be taken into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and others ſhut out, it will be known to be a matter of greateſt concerment, if once we could be induced to be in earneſt in this one thing, there were a great point gained on the hearers of the Goſpel, and till it be ſeriouſly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is nothing that we can do in Religion, that will be to any purpoſe.</p>

            <p>IT's a great matter to have the ſolid impreſſion of Chriſt's fulneſs on our Spirits, and to be throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that there is a Rigteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be had in Him; yet the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation is not full, unleſs there be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the way, how this Righteouſneſſe is applyed, and come by, and a kindly yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to follow that way; For though we know that Chriſt died, and that there is a Righteouſneſſe Purchaſed, yet, there are many that are never Juſtified, and that ſhall never be ſaved by it; And therefore it would not be ſo much, to know that
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:152256:222"/> there is ſuch a thing; if he had not laid down a way how we may be partakers of it; which way can no more fail and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, then Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe can; and theſe Words hold out the way, <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant justifie many:</hi> That is, through Faith in Chriſt many ſhall be made Righteous; His Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſhall be accounted the Believers, whereby it ſhall come to paſſe, that they ſhall be as really Juſtified; as if they had born their own iniquities, becauſe His bearing of them ſhall be accounted theirs.</p>
            <p>We ſpake, 1. of this general, that there is ſuch a thing as Juſtification, or God's Abſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lving of a Sinner, who by His own iniquity, is lyable to the Curſe. 2. That this Juſtification is the proper effect of Chriſt's Death. 3. From the Object of it; That they are <hi>many,</hi> yet not all, who are Juſtified, <hi>many</hi> being put as a mids betwixt two extreams, neither includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all, nor only taking in a very few; having put by theſe more general <hi>Doctrines,</hi> we would now ſpeak a little to this great benefit of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> in reference to the particular <hi>Cauſes</hi> that concur to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, which will lead us to a more diſtinct uptaking of it; there is ground for them all in the <hi>Text;</hi> and therefore we ſhall put them together; that ye may have a ſhort view of this great benefit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexly.</p>
            <p>There are commonly, <hi>ſix cauſes</hi> aſſigned to, or made neceſſary to concur in Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; though we know not well how to expreſſe them, ſo as ye may take them up, becauſe of the ignorance of many of you. 1. There is the <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe, and that is God; the party that doth Juſtifie. 2. The <hi>end,</hi> or <hi>final</hi> Cauſe, and that is His own Glory. 3. The <hi>Meritorious</hi> Cauſe, or that which procures it, or the ground on which God Juſtifies, And that is Chriſt's Merit. 4. The <hi>inward inſtrumental</hi> Cauſe, by which we get a tittle to, and an intereſt in Chriſt's Merit, and that is Faith. 5. The <hi>Formal</hi> Cauſe, or that wherein Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation conſiſts, and that is Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe to the Sinner upon His acceptation of it, and the Abſolving of the Sinner, by vertue of His Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. 6. The <hi>External Inſtrumental</hi> Cauſe, and that is the Word of God, by which this Juſtification is revealed, and wherein God declares, and paſſes the Sentence.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> ye would for clearing of it, remember what we ſpake in our entring on this Doctrine; That this Word <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is a Legal, Forenſick, or Judicial Word; and we are to conceive of God, who is the party offended, as the Judge; and of the Sinner Arraigned, and brought before His Tribunal to be Judged, as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent; the Law gives in the Lybel, or Inditement, founds the Challenge, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation; the Sinners Conſcience, and Actions are as ſo many Witneſſes, proving the breaking of the Law, and him to be obnoxious to the Curſe on that account; In this we ſay that God is the <hi>efficient</hi> Cauſe, and ſo we may take the Words, <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many;</hi> Actively, and efficiently to look to Chriſt, as having this Power, as He is God; which is proper to God alone, as is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>It is God that juſtifies:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Though I know nothing by my ſelf, yet I am not hereby juſtified, but he that judgeth me is the Lord;</hi> And this is a reaſon of the former; to wit, that no other can Abſolve but God, the party offended, who is Judge.</p>
            <p>We mark it for this practical <hi>Uſe</hi> which the Apoſtle makes of it, which is to bid us lay leſs weight upon others, thinking well of us, or abſolving us; and on our own abſolving of our ſelves; the Lord chargeth ſome thus, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. <hi>Ye are they which juſtifie your ſelves before men, but God knows your hearts: Paul</hi> will not juſtifie himſelf, for that is Gods place and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; How many are there, who take another perſons teſtimony for Gods, and think, that ſince others love, reſpect, and commend them, they are in a good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and well enough; but, alace, is that Perſon God? Except mens teſtimony be founded on the grounds that are held forth in the Word, (and if ſo, then it's Gods Teſtimony) it will not do the buſineſſe,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:152256:223"/> nor avail you any thing; except there be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſt by Him, their Sentence, or your own will be recalled; Though many of you do not down right profeſſe this, yet many of you practically fall into it; alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that it is God that Juſtifies, and that His Abſolution is different from mens, and from your own; many may have good thoughts of you, and ſo may ye of your ſelves, when God may have none. For the 2d. To wit, The <hi>final</hi> Cauſe, it is clear here alſo, by comparing the former <hi>verſe</hi> with the Words going before, in this ſame <hi>verſe;</hi> and ye may take it in this <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation;</hi> That the Glory of God, and of the Media or, is the end that God hath before Him, in the Juſtifying of Sinners; Therefore it is called the Lords <hi>pleaſure,</hi> or delight, and the Mediators <hi>ſatisfaction;</hi> becauſe He hath propoſed to Himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Glory of His Grace, eſpecially, and alſo of others of His Attributs, as His end, and ſo hath a kind of longing deſire, and thirſt after it; for the Lord being Abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Glorious, cannot, but love His own Glory, and being the infinitly Pure, Alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Good, He cannot but love Himſelf, and His own Glory; and therefore, for attaining of this end, He Juſtifies and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves poor Sinners: Now God is glorified here two wayes. 1. He gets the Glory of His Grace, that is exceedingly magnified thereby, as is clear, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Having predestinated us to the adoption of children, by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace;</hi> It's the Lords pleaſure, to glorifie His Grace; and this proves to be to the Glory of His Grace, when a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner lyable to Wrath is fully Juſtifyed, and Intitled to Heaven. 2. He gets thereby the Glory of His Juſtice, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which takes in the Glorifying of God's Holineſs and Wiſdom; He is ſeen here to be a Holy God, who will needs teſtifie His diſlike at Sin, where ever it is; a juſt God, that will needs puniſh it, a gracious God, that will pardon; and ſuch a wiſe God, as finds out the way how both to puniſh and pardon, without any the leaſt Imputation, either to His Juſtice, or to His Mercy, and Grace; and ſo He ſhews Himſelf to be Infinitly Juſt, Gracious, Wiſe and Holy, in the Juſtification of Sinners; Theſe we may ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25, 26. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There Juſtice and Grace ſhine clearly, Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is free, yet there is a Price laid down, and a Satisfaction made to Juſtice; and the 26. <hi>verſe</hi> ſhews the end, to wit, <hi>To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his righteouſneſs, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of them who believe in Jeſus;</hi> He hath indeed taken a way, how to pardon Sin, but ſo as it is through a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, or by the exacting of a Price, that He may be ſeen to be Juſt, who will not pardon Sin without a Satisfaction; Juſtice kythes in this, that Chriſt is put to pay a great Price; and that He may be ſeen to be Gracious, He hath laid down a way, how the Price that was to be payed by Chriſt, might be imputed to or reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on the account of the guilty Sinner, and that He might thereby be Abſolved: And thus Juſtice and Grace kiſs each other, in this admirable contrivance; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though none almoſt except <hi>Socinians</hi> deny the Juſtice of God, in the Juſtification of Sinners; yet as they do Doctrinally, in Subſtance deny it; So many of us, who profeſſe to abhore their Doctrine, do practically deny it alſo.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as the 1. <hi>Uſe</hi> of it, let me ſpeak a little to unbelievers, and aſk you, what think you will become of you? ye muſt either betake your ſelves to Chriſts Satisfaction, or ye muſt reſolve to Satisfie for your ſelves; Secure Hypocrits think of nothing but of Grace, and that God will alwayes be Gracious; and never ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves think of the neceſſity of a Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made to His Juſtice; and thus they ſlight, and on the matter deny His Juſtice; as if He were not to be Glorified, in that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute as well as in His Grace, and Mercy; whereas there is no other way to declare God to be Juſt, in the Juſtification of them that believe; but this which brings them to Chriſts Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. It's ground of notable Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:152256:223"/> and Encouragement to a poor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed Soul, ſenſible of Sin, whereupon to expect Juſtification; It's Gods end in Juſtifying Sinners, to ſet out the Glory of His Grace; and is it not much, that God ſhould contrive ſuch a way for glorifying of Himſelf, as ſhould carrie along in it good to us, yea, ſuch a way as ſhould reſolve in our good, which comes in as a ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinat end, to the glorifying of His Grace, as the ultimat end; may not this be an encouragement to them, to ſeek after Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication on theſe terms, and for this end?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. It ſhews, that as many as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not to the way of this Righteouſneſs, and of Juſtification by Grace, are thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God's End; they ſet themſelves to hinder and obſtruct it, even that He ſhould not be glorified in His Juſtice and Mercy; They do what they can, that God ſhould neither be Juſt nor Gracious; but He ſhall be Juſt in condemning them; whether they will or not, though He be not glorified in His Grace, as to them, they ſetting themſelves, what they can to let it, yet in His Juſtice, He ſhall moſt certainly be glorified: O! that Men and Women believed how deep their Guilt draws, who are found ſtanding in the way of the glorifying of Gods Grace; It will be found in ſome reſpect, to draw deeper then the Guilt of theſe abominable Sins of Adultery and Murder in the day of the Lord; and yet many of you will be found to have done this, and to have come ſhort of Righteouſneſs.

               </gap> as righteous before Him.</p>
            <p>This is no in ſo many words profeſſedly controverted, or denyed by the <hi>Papists,</hi> with whom we here deal; For they grant, that Chriſt, by His Sufferings, procures Grace, and Gods acceptation of our good Works, in ſo far as they are rewarded beyond their condignitie: But to make the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt them, and us the more clear, we ſhall put in <hi>Four</hi> Words in the Doctrine and ſpeak a little to them; We ſay then, that Chriſts Satisfaction is not only the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe of Juſtification, but alſo 1. It is the neareſt, and moſt immediat Cauſe. 2. The alone Meritorious Cauſe. 3. The Meritorious Cauſe, as Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed from, and oppoſed to our own Works, and inherent Righteouſneſſe. 4. It is the Meritorious Cauſe, as inherent in Him, and as imputed to us; Theſe <hi>Four</hi> are clear in the <hi>Text,</hi> and may very well be put in the Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="442" facs="tcp:152256:224"/>1. Then we ſay, it's not only the Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Cauſe but the next Immediat Cauſe, <hi>cauſa repinqua,</hi> (as we uſe to ſpeak in the School) of our Juſtification; So that if it be aſked, what is the Cauſe or Ground, on which God Abſolves a Sinner, or the next Immediat thing, that He hath a reſpect to in His Juſtifying of him? It's Chriſts Merit, His Soul-travel, and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>Papiſts</hi> deny this; and make the next Immediat Cauſe to be the Grace infuſed in us, that which is called, <hi>gratia gratum faciens:</hi> But if ye aſk the Prophet, what is the Ground, I mean the next Immediat Cauſe, on which Juſtification is deryved to many? He tells us that it's not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteouſneſſe of theſe who are Juſtified: but that it's Chriſt's <hi>Soul-travel,</hi> and <hi>His bearing of our iniquities;</hi> Hence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Chriſt is called our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, <hi>He is,</hi> (ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the Apoſtle) <hi>made of God unto us, wiſdom, righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Not only by Chriſt have we a Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that makes us acceptable to God, but His Righteouſneſſe is ours, and God reſpecting of us, in, or through it makes us acceptable.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Not only is His Righteouſneſſe the Meritorious Cauſe, but it's the only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, or the alone Meritorious Cauſe; and herein <hi>Papiſts</hi> and we differ: They grant that Chriſt's Satisfaction is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe, but remotly only, as it procures inward, or inherent Grace, by which we Merit; but they will not have it to be the only Meritorious Cauſe; but will needs have our own Works to merit alſo, and that properly; whereas the Prophet ſpeaks of Juſtification as the effect of Chriſt's Soul-travel only; and if ſo, then there can be no other thing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, for there cannot be two ſocial, or joynt Meritorious Cauſes; Therefore, throughout the Scripture, when the Merit of Juſtification is attributed to Chriſt, it excludes all other things, and is oppoſed to our own works; which is the <hi>Third</hi> thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. Then we ſay, That Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is the Meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification, as Contra-diſtinguiſhed from, and oppoſed to our own inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, or Works; and herein alſo <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> and we differ; They grant indeed a Meritorious Influence to Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; but that is (ſay they) as it makes our own Righteouſneſſe Meritorious; Not as Contra-diſtinguiſhed from, and oppoſed to our own Righteouſneſſe, but as having influence on it. Now theſe are directly oppoſed in Scripture, I ſhall only name that one clear place, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 9. <hi>That I may be found in him, not having my own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, which is of the law, out that which is through the faith of Christ;</hi> Where <hi>Paul</hi> conſulting, and reſolving what he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelf to, as his Defence at the bar of God; We ſee, 1. That it is His Scope, and Deſign, that in the day of Judgement, he may be found in ſuch a caſe and poſture, that he may be able to abide the tryal, And 2. That he ſpeaks of <hi>Two</hi> Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the <hi>One</hi> is his own, that is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Grace which he hath gotten, and the Works which he hath done: The <hi>Other</hi> is the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, which is by Faith; Now when he layes his reckoning, he is ſo far from joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe two together, as Con-cauſes, or Social Cauſes of his Juſtification, that he oppoſes them; <hi>That I may be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſs in him,</hi> without my own, or, <hi>not having my own,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in him,</hi> as having given up with deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and renunced my own Righteouſneſſe; he will not admit of that on any terms, in leſſe or in more; ſo clearly doth he, as to his Juſtification before God, ſeclude his own Righteouſneſſe, and betake himſelf to Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe alone, as Contra-diſtinguiſhed to his own.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly. We ſay, That Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is in Him, and imputed to us, or made ours by imputation; is the alone Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Cauſe of our Juſtification, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; ſo as that which He hath purchaſed is reckoned, and accounted the Sinners, as if it were His own inherently and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally; This I alſo gather from the Words, <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their iniquities;</hi> Would ye know, as if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:152256:224"/> had ſaid, how Chriſt is the Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cauſe of Juſtification? Thus it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He ſhall bear their iniquities, if He hath taken on the burden of their Sins, and had their Sins imputed to Him, then it will follow by proportion, that they are Juſtified by the imputation of His Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to them; and there is nothing that the Scripture doth more inculcat then this, That we are Juſtified by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt, without us, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, or reckoned ours, we by Faith laying hold upon it, and Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of it for us, mak s it become ours; and yet there is nothing that we do more particular<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>are our iniquities; He became our Righteouſneſſe, by paying of our D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bt, as our Cautioner, and no otherwayes; the Scripture never ſpeaks of His being our Righteouſneſſe, by procuring ability to us, to pay our own Debt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall clear this 4th Branch a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe it will ſerve to clear the reſt, That is, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe, as it is in Him, and imputed to us, is he only Meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification; And if we conſider, 1 The way of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication that is uſed among men, this will be the more plain; There being two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, by the one of which, Life was once attainable, and by the other, of which it is only now attainable; 1. The Covenant of Works, which abſolves a man that never brake it; which is, as when one among men, or before mens Court, is declared to be free, becauſe he was never o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing the Debt. 2. The Covenant of Grace, that provides a Cautioner to pay the Sinners Debt, upon whoſe payment thereof had recourſe to by Faith, there is acceſs in Law, to the Sinner to call for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution: even as it is in mens Courts; though the principal Debter hath nothing to pay, yet if the Cautioner pay the Debt, it is the principal Debtors cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aring; and if he ſhould be again charged to pay the Debt; his immediat de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence would be, that the Cautioner had payed it already: So is it here, the Lord hath borrowed, and made uſe of this way, that is uſed among men, to make the Myſtery of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which paſſeth in the Court of God, the more clear to us; it is as if one ſhould alleadge, that ſuch a Perſon is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much, and he ſhould ſay, I cannot be charged with it, and upon what ground? Not becauſe I was not owing the Debt, but becauſe ſuch anone has payed it for me; So ſayeth the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34 <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect, it is God that juſtifies, who ſhall condemne? it is Chriſt that died,</hi> &amp;c. The defence propoſed before the Tribunal of God, is Chritis dying, and that is as much, as he hath payed the Price, or Debt; who then can charge it on the principal Debtor? And the frame, and contexture of the words ſhews, that it is a judicial precedour; for they ſuppoſe a charge or lybel, and a ſentence, and the Meritorious Cauſe of the Sentence of Abſolution is, <hi>that Chriſt</hi> hath <hi>died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2ly. If we conſider the nature of the two Covenants, and compare them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it will be clear, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> confound the two Covenants; For <hi>works,</hi> to them is the condition of both Covenants, making uſe of that place, <hi>Matth</hi> 19.17 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Keep the commands, if thou will be perfect, ſell all thou haſt, and give to the poor,</hi> quite contrary to the ſcope of it; for therein Chriſt is putting the man to a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to himſelf, to bring him to ſee the neceſſity of a Mediator; and diſcover his unſoundneſſe, when he will not forgoe his great Poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3ly. It will be clear if we conſider how the Scripture ſpeaks of Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe becoming ours, even as our Sins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Chriſt's, and was the cauſe (if we may ſo ſpeak) of His condemnation; that is, as He became lyable to the Curſe, that as He ſtood a Legal Perſon in our Room, He became guilty, and lyable to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Debt; For otherwayes it is abominable once to ſpeak of His condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if His Righteouſneſſe become ours, as our Sin became His, then certainly His Righteouſneſſe is the cauſe of our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is in Him inherently, and in us by imputation only; The blaſphemy of <hi>Antinomians,</hi> is moſt deteſtable, and not at all pleaded for, even <hi>by Papiſts;</hi> and therefore we ſtand not on it here; Now our Sin became Chriſt's by imputation, therefore His Righteouſneſſe muſt be ours the ſame way; If it then were aſked, How we are Juſtified? The Text anſwers, <hi>He ſhall juſtifie many, becauſe he ſhall bear their iniquities;</hi> The Prophet makes his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be the antecedent whereof our Juſtification is the conſequent, for His bearing of our iniquities is given as the reaſon of our Juſtification; this is alſo clear, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.

               </gap>me way are we made righteous; and that is, by imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe to us, and not by our own merit; we have no more merit then He had ſin; but as He was accounted to be the Sinner, though free of Sin in His own Perſon; ſo a believing Sinner is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted righteous, though without any merit in Himſelf, becauſe God hath ingag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in His Covenant, to make Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe forth-coming to the Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; Though that were enough; yet the Spirit of the Lord addeth a further Word; <hi>in him,</hi> to anſwer that queſtion, whether Chriſt hath procured inherent holineſſe to us, that thereby we may be Juſtified; no ſayeth he, that is not the way; Our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is <hi>in him,</hi> and not inherent in us, even as the ſum imputed to Chriſt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently in us; ſo the Righteouſneſſe whereby we are Juſtified, is inherently in Him.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly. It may be clear from this, That frequently it is called a Righteouſneſſe that is attained by Faith, and that is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to our own Righteouſneſſe, and working; now it cannot be conceived, how we can get a Righteouſneſſe by Faith, but by pleading, that His Righteouſneſſe may be imputed unto us; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22.

<pb n="446" facs="tcp:152256:226"/> who cannot Merit, are juſtified, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to glory by Chriſt's Merit, as the immediat, and proxime cauſe of their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and why not alſo of theſe that are at age? Is He not the common Cauſe? what abſurdity is in the one more then in the other? Is not the Juſtification of both alike free? though there be a difference in the manner of Application, yet in the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Cauſe there is no difference; and ſeing to Children, Chriſt is the Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cauſe of their Juſtification; why not alſo to theſe come to Age? 2. They will grant an imputation of the Righteouſneſſe, and Merits of other Saints to them that want of their own, as to the removal of temporal plagues, and the taking them out of Purgatory; and if they grant that there may be an imputation of the Merits of Saints; why deny they the imputation of the Merits of Chriſt, as to the removal of eternal Wrath? is there any probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that there can be any imputation of the one, and not an imputation of the other? 3. They allow an imputation of Chriſts Merits, as to the procuring of the firſt Grace without all Faith apprehending Him; and, if by their own Doctrine, it be not abſurd to ſpeak of Chriſt's Merit, as to the infuſing of Grace at firſt, why ſhall it be thought abſurd to ſpeak of Chriſt's Merit, as to the procuring of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? 4. They grant, that there is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, as to the procuring of Glory, in a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; (though they ſay, that it is a far better Life, which comes by our own works) and why not, as to the procu ing of Glory, in a lower degree, yea, both of Grace and Glory, and of every good Thing? We have inſiſted on this the more. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's the main foundation of our Faith, and the end of it, and the great ſcope of the Goſpel. 2.

Becauſe it ſerves much to clear this Truth, for we would have you know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it's not enough to ſpeak of Chriſt's Merit, as the cauſe of our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God; a <hi>Papiſt</hi> will do that, who yet leaneth not to Chriſts Merits alone, but to his own, at leaſt in part, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with Chriſt's; and therefore we would now and then ſpeak of this, becauſe there is ſuch horrible ignorance of it though a fundamental Truth; How many gay honeſt folks (as they are called and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted) are there among us, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how they came to be Juſtified, or what is the ground which they have to reſt on, if they were going to die?

<pb n="449" facs="tcp:152256:227"/> may look on it as agreeing to, and meant of Faith.</p>
            <p>We ſhall here inſiſt a little on this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which is implyed in the Words; that Juſtification through Faith, or the obtaining of the Pardon of Sin, through Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, taken hold of by Faith, doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in the perſon that may expect it; Or thus, Faith, where it is Saving, and ſuch as Juſtifies, hath alwayes Knowledge going along with it; other wayes Faith could not be called <hi>Knowledge;</hi> There may be Knowledge without Faith, but there can be no Faith without Knowledge; and ſo conſequently a Sinner cannot expect Juſtification without Knowledge; For making out of this, ye may conſider theſe things. 1. Faith is of it ſelf nothing, but as it layes hold on ſome Object, How can Faith lay hold on an Object except it know it? as the Word is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>How can they believe except they hear,</hi> Can any perſon reſt on an unknown Mediator? that ſure were not Faith but a blind guiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; It's juſt, as if ye ſhould ſay that ye believe ſuch a thing, when yet ye cannot at all tell what it is; which is not Faith, but as I ſaid, blind guiſſing, and preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. Faith as Juſtifying, is alwayes holden forth, as making uſe of, and giving credit to that which is revealed in the Word; hence we that hear the Goſpel, have that revealed to us therein, binding us to the belief of it, that Heathens have not, as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>I am not aſhamed of the goſpel of Christ, for therein is the righteouſneſs of God revealed from faith to faith,</hi> Where it is neceſſarly preſuppoſed, that the revealing of the Righteouſneſſe of the Goſpel, (which here comprehends the knowing of it) muſt go before Faith, and as a Perſon grows in Faith, he grows in the knowledge of it; hence alſo, they are ſaid to be ſtrong in Faith, who were ſtrong in knowledge; and they were ſaid to be weak in Knowledge, who are weak in Faith, <hi>Rom,</hi> 14.1. and 15.1. Becauſe they knew not that the cerimonial Law was taken away, and particularly the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Meats; and ſo durſt not hazard on ſome things, which their Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty gave them acceſſe to. 3. Conſider, that in Juſtification, God would have a Sinner to proceed as a man doth, who tables his defenſe before an earthly Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of Juſtice; who, if he pleads well, and on relevant grounds, he comes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the better to; And as it is dangerous, in a weighty cauſe depending, to have an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Advocat, who puts in a wrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; ſo is it here, and in this caſe to be ignorant; hence, <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 10. It's given as the reaſon of the <hi>Jews</hi> miſcarriage in the point of Juſtification, <hi>but being ignorant of the righteouſneſſe of God, they went about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs;</hi> That is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Conſider, that there muſt be Repentence, ere a Sinner can be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; which ſuppoſeth Knowledge; For he muſt needs know his Sin, and that his own Righteouſneſſe will not do his rurn; and ſo long as he is ignorant, he cannot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, nor renunce his own Righteouſneſſe, For while he is ſo, he cannot know what is Sin, and what is not Sin; what is Faith, and what is preſumption, unleſſe it be by gueſs; and folk will never be ſuitably affected with Sin by gueſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt ſayes to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman, <hi>If thou hadest known who it is that asked it of thee, thou wouldeſt have given him drink, and he ſhould have given thee living water;</hi> where He inſinuats, that her Ignorance was a great cauſe why ſhe keeped at ſuch a diſtance from Him; It's hardly poſſible, that ſo many poor Souls, would abide at ſuch a diſtance from Chriſt, if they knew Him; There is no deſire after that which is unknown; and therefore many do live at ſuch a diſtance from Chriſt; becauſe they have not ſo much as the literal Knowledge, or Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Faith of His Worth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> are <hi>Three.</hi> 1. Take it for granted, if ever ye would ſee the face of God, that there is a neceſſity of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; For Knowledge is a piece of God's Image, as well as Holineſſe; and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is commanded as well as Holineſſe; Knowledge was placed in the firſt Man <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> as well as Holineſs; and when we are renewed after the Image of God, in conformity to the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed <hi>in knowledge:</hi> And not only ſo, but Knowledge is a mean of the exerciſe of Faith, of Repentance, and of Holineſs; and if ſuch a thing be needful, by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a mids, in order to an end; if obedience to a command; or, if the thing it ſelf that is to be known, be needful, then Knowledge muſt be needful; It's true, we would beware of extremities here; as either to ſay on the one hand, that their muſt be ſuch a high degree of Knowledge; For in the ſpeculative part of Knowledge, (to ſpeak ſo) Reprobats may go beyond Believers; Or upon the other hand, to think that Knowledge is enough, and that there needs no more but Knowledge; as, alace, many do reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Knowledge; and therefore we would beware of ſeperating theſe two, Knowledge and Faith.</p>
            <p>If it be aſked here, what Knowledge is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to Juſtification? I would ſpeak a Word to this Queſtion, not ſo much for ſatisfying of curioſity; but for your Inſtruction, who are more Ignorant; and to ſhew the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the thing, and to give you a ſhort view of theſe things, that are neceſſary to be known about this matter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, 1. Ye muſt know God, that Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies you, ere ye can be Juſtified; as it is, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and him whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> If ever ye be abſolved, before ſuch a Judicatory, ye muſt know your Judge; That there is one God, that He is one in His Eſſence; and that there are three Perſons; yet ſo, as the Trinity of Perſons doth not hinder, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Unity, or Onneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are three that bear record in heaven, the father, the word, and the holy ghost, and theſe three are one;</hi> Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy then to know God, who is your Judge, not ſo much out of curioſity, ſeeking to know how the Perſons differ, as to their manner of ſubſiſting, as how to be fixed in the Faith of the thing. 2. Ye would know your ſelves, and what may be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on you before God; Can men carry rightly before a Judge, or before a Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:152256:228"/> if they know not how it ſtands with them: And this will lead you to know the State and Caſe wherein ye were made at firſt; And the Covenant of Works, which God made with Man at the beginning, when He gave to Him the promiſe of Life, upon condition of Obedience; and that ye are lyable to the Curſe, due for the breach of that Law and Covenant; elſe ye will never know your hazard; and knowing the breach of the Law, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works; it will make you, through God's bleſſing, to ſeek after Juſtification, which otherwayes ye will never do; And ſo ye are to know, that the firſt Covenant was broken by <hi>Adam,</hi> and that this made him, and all his poſterity lyable to the Curſe, as being guilty of his tranſgreſſion; and this takes in the knowledge of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Sin, even of the ſinfull Eſtate wherein ye were born, and of your Actual Sins. 3. Ye muſt know, how a Sinner, lying in ſuch a State, and Caſe under Sin and Wrath, may come to be abſolved; And this leads you in to know, that there is a New Covenant made through a Mediator, in which there is a Promiſe of Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through believing in Him, which, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. is called <hi>the law of faith,</hi> which gives a Sinner ground of hope to be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Righteouſneſſe of a Cautioner; and leads him in to know the Defence, that he may, and ought to plead upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; And there is here preſuppoſed, as a neceſſity of knowing your ſelves, ſo a neceſſity of knowing the Law, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, (for if we plead innocent in any one Sin, whereof we are guilty, it may hazard our eternal ruine) And a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of knowing Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification; that He became man, and did take to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a true Humane Body, and a reaſonable Soul; that by the Union of His two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, He might be God and Man in one Perſon; in reference to which He muſt needs be known; for if we know Him not to be Man; we cannot underſtand how Divine Juſtice is Satisfied; and if we know Him not to be God, we cannot underſtand how the Humane Nature can be ſuſtained, and ſupported and carried through in Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Juſtice of God; and withal, a neceſſity of knowing how the Mediator procures this Juſtification: and this leads us in to know His Office; how He was a Prieſt, and interpoſed betwixt God and Sinners, and made Himſelf an Offering for our Sin, and maketh interceſſion for us; how He was a Prophet, and how, when the thing was unknown; to wit, how a Sinner might have peace with God, He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it of Old by His Prophets, in the Old Teſtament, and by His Apoſtles, and Miniſters in the New Teſtament, and doth by His Spirit ellighten the Soul, to take up the difference betwixt Juſtification by Faith, and Juſtification by Works; how He is a King to ſubdue Sin in us, to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our Corrupt Nature; that will ſtill boaſt till it be ſubdued, to guide us in His way, to fight our Spiritual Battels in us, and for us; and to take courſe with all His, and our Enemies, Otherwayes, if we know not this, though we were juſtified juſt now; we would be led captive by Sin, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to our ruine within an hour, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Him to be King, it gives Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> footing to expect Through-beating and Victory. 4. As we muſt know what Chriſt is; ſo we muſt know what is in Chriſt, and what is communicated and applyed to Sinners by Him, and ſo the condition of the Covenant of Grace, which is Faith, whereby we come to be united to Chriſt; and that this Faith is not a bare aſſenting to the Truth, but a cloſing with, and a reſting on Him; for we can never believe, except we know what Faith is. 5. It is needful, that we know what Dutie is called for, from a Juſtified Perſon; to wit, Repentance and Holineſs; becauſe, though He Juſtifies none for Repentance, yet He Juſtifies none but Penitents, and He requires Repentance from all whom He Juſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is alſo a neceſſity of the Knowledge of Chriſts Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance

            <p>The 2d. <hi>Uſe,</hi> Serves for Reproof, and Conviction to them that lye ſtill in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which is a moſt Sinful and Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Condition; for if Knowledge be a Duty, and if Ignorance be a Sin, and ſuch a Sin as hazards the Soul, then what a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful caſe are many of you in, who now hear me? Lay aſide all other Sins, I would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſpeak of the great Ignorance that is among you; How many of you are there, that cannot give any tollerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your Catechiſm; who know not your natural State and Condition, nor the way how to come at peace with God; nor any ground for your Faith to reſt upon; nor Chriſt, nor His Offices? and, alace, if it be ſo, what better are ye then Heathens? Sure ye are much worſe; becauſe ye have diſpiſed Knowledge; Can the Goſpel give you Faith, to whom it never gave Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? There are ſeveral ſorts of Perſons, to whom I would here ſpeak a Word. 1: There are ſome that never lay the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Knowledge to heart, betwixt whom, and <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> there is in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

O! that ye would conſider, what a Sin Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is; when the Devil appeared in the World, he made it a great part of his firſt Work, to extinguiſh, and put out the light of Knowledge, and by this means he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſtill to keep Folk in Ignorance; hence the Apoſtle ſayes. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>If our goſpel he hid, it is hid to them who are lost, whoſe eyes the god of this world hath blinded;</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanity and Error are great Baits and Snares; but Ignorance carries moe to hell then both theſe do; for Ignorance foſtereth and cheeriſheth, if it do not alſo beget, Prophanity and Error; as the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> inſinuats, when he ſayes, that the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or <hi>Unlearned, Wrest,</hi> or pervert <hi>the Scriptures unto their own deſtruction;</hi> much Ignorance, and Conceit of Knowledge, will ſoon and eaſily ſhake people looſe, and make them a Prey to Error, and alſo to Prophanity; muſt not Ignorance then be an evil thing, when it leads the way to ſo many other Sins, and at laſt to Hell, and Deſtruction? hence it is, at leaſt in part, that the Kingdom of Satan is called the <hi>kingdom of darkneſs;</hi> and ſure they are very proper Subjects of his Kingdom, who are Ignorant; and is it poſſible think ye, that people can think of God, or of their Dutie aright, or have any ſolid peace, who are in that Condition? They are juſt like to one ſleeping on the top of a Maſt, in great hazard, and yet utterly ſenſleſſe of it: Look but to <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Words, that hold out the dreadfull danger, and hazard of your Condition, who are Ignorant; The <hi>First</hi> is that, 2. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 1. <hi>Chriſt will come in flaming fire, to render vengeance to all them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel;</hi> The 2d. is, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. <hi>My people periſh

A 2d. Son will readily grant, that Ignorance is an evil thing, and that Knowledge is good and deſirable; but yet they take no pains to have their Ignorance cured, and remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or to attain Knowledge: They are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and confident, though poor, blind and wretched, and make their Ignorance a cloak of excuſe for their other Sins: Hence ſome will ſay, we have been poor ignorant bodies, and we hope that God will not lay Sin to our charge: O! what deluſion, and diſperat danger is here? If it be aſked, (and it would become us well to inquire in it:) What can be the reaſon of this horribly groſs Ignorance, that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us? which is ſuch that we are almoſt hopleſſe of many of you: if ſome extraordinary works of God's Spirit fall not in on your minds, and hearts: very readily theſe go together, the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, are the moſt ſenſleſs, and the moſt Ignorant, are the moſt confident: The cauſes of this may be ſeveral, as, 1. Folks undervaluing the practice of Religion, let the moſt Ignorant Perſons, being earneſt in the practice of Religion, and they will, readily through Gods bleſſing, as ſeek after, ſo come at ſome meaſure of Knowledge: This is a fountain of your Ignorance, that ye are not in earneſt in Religion: <hi>Then ſhall ye know,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, Chap.</hi> 6.) <hi>if ye follow on to know the Lord:</hi> Excuſe not your Ignorance, and want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by your not being Book-learned: by your want of time and leaſure, and by other ſuch ſhifts: If ye were in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and ſerious in ſeeking after the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the things of Religion, ye would ſoon in ſome meaſure underſtand, and take them up: But ye come and hear, and ſit for an hour, and take no heed what is ſpoken: ye will not read the Catechiſm, nor aſk a queſtion about what ye are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of; nor will take heed to what is ſaid, when others are examined; There are none of you, but if ye were in earneſt, ye might come to ſome good meaſure of Knowledge; becauſe they were ſometim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> as ignorant as ye are, and as incapable, who yet have come to Knowledge, and theſe will be witneſſes againſt you, who had the ſame Goſpel, the ſame ſeaſons and means of Knowledge, and yet continued full in your Ignorance. 2. Many of you do not value the ſinfulneſſe, and hazard of Ignorance; For ye continue as ſecure, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> if God would never lay it to your charge, ye would not readily lye in the Sin of Drunkenneſs, or of Swearing, or of any other ſuch things without a challenge, but ye can lye ſtill in your Ignorance, and in the Sin of not profiting by the means which ye are under, and yet diſpenſe with your ſelves therein; and ye ſecretly ſay within your ſelves; if we be well other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, we hope Knowledge will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us; But will not, think ye, Gods Image be required to be in you? are not Faith, Repentance, and Holineſs required? and can any of theſe, I pray, be without Knowledge? do ye ſee any touched with the impreſſion of their Sin and Guilt, but as ſoon they fall to the ſtudy of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? and who continue to be Ignorant, but ſtupid bodies, that never ſaw their hazard? which is an ordinary companion, and attendant of Ignorance. A 3d. Cauſe is Negligence, and ſloathfulneſs; The wiſe man ſayes, <hi>The hand of the diligent maketh rich;</hi> and ſlothfulneſs brings on poverty, in every thing; if ye compare Folks together, ye will find that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any are ſoberly, and ſeriouſly diligent God bleſſes it; So that we may gather, and conclude their diligence from their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; There are many here, who, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are very Ignorant, but let me aſk you, what time &amp; pains have ye ever beſtowed on the ſtudy of Knowledge? ye hear the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ye read a Chapter of the Bible now and then; but that's not enough, for ye may be preſent here, and yet not hear to any purpoſe; How many come to hear the preaching of the Word, from whom, through their own fault, Devils come, as ſo many Craws on new ſowen Land, and
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:152256:230"/> ſnatch away the Word that is ſowen? and it's never known, that ſuch ſeed was ſown; for moſt part, ye either hear negligently; or ye quickly forget all that ye hear; ye never ſpeak of it in your Families, neither take ye any time for re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ding, and ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Catechiſm; how many of you did ever ſet any dayes, or hours apart to ſtudy Knowledge? Ye will cry out againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Enthuſiaſineſs, and Inſpirations as Deluſions, and there is good reaſon for it; But how ſhall ye get Knowledge, if ye will be at no pains for it? your practice ſayes, ye expect it ſhould come by immediat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, without all uſe of ordinary and appointed means. 4. Others wil ſay, that they would fain know, but they are very dull and incapable; and it's often true, that they are ſo; but are ſuch in earneſt, out of love to Knowledge, ſtudying to come by it? It's ſaid of ſome. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Becauſe they received not the truth in love, God gave them up to ſtrong deluſions, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lie.</hi> There are many, who ſtudy Knowledge, but not from a right principle; nor from a right motive; it may be, that they may get their Token to come to the Lord's Supper, to eſhew ſhame when they are examined, or that they may be able to talk; It's juſt with God to let ſuch want Knowledge. 5. Folks go not about the uſe of ordinary means, as having therein, need of God's bleſſing, and of His Spirit to help them rightly to take up His Myſteries, they pray not for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as Gods gift, how many of you, when ye take up the Catechiſm to read, fall down on your knees to ſeek God's bleſſing on your reading thereof? When <hi>John</hi> is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the benefits that come by Chriſt; this is by him put in among the reſt, <hi>And hath given us an underſtanding, that we may know him that is true,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20. If therefore ye would know God aright, ſeek His bleſſing in the uſe of His own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed means; ye ſtudy the Knowledge of God even as if ye were to read a common humane Hiſtory; if ye ſeek a bleſſing to your Meat, why ſeek ye not a bleſſing on the means of Knowledge? which is as neceſſary to the Soul, as Meat is to the Belly: How often hath <hi>David</hi> ſuch a ſuit to God, when he ſayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Open mine eyes, that I may ſee the wonderous, things of thy law; teach me thy ſtatutes,</hi> &amp;c. He thought no ſhame to pray for Knowledge; ſure if we prayed more for it, we ſhould thrive bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in it; Other reaſons may fall in, in the <hi>Directions</hi> annent the ſtudy of Knowledge which we ſhall give you.</p>
            <p>The 3d. <hi>Uſe,</hi> Serves to exhort you to, and to commend the ſtudy of Knowledge to you, as a neceſſary commendable, and profitable Duty; can we hope to prevail with you in any thing; if we prevail not with you in this, even to lay the neceſſity of Knowledge to heart? will not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Object, the Authority of God commanding it, the advantages that come by it, with the prejudices that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends and follows the want of it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to you? will ye ever be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſeek after Faith and Holineſſe, that will not be perſwaded to ſtudy Knowledge? It's a wonder how many of you can have the confidence to ſay, that ye keep your hearts to God, when ye are ſo void of the very form of Religion, which much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Knowledge, For it's that wherein it's keeped, and whereby, through Grace it's ſuitably exerciſed; Sure ye can never have the power of Religion, who want the form of it; therefore let me exhort you all, eſpecially ſuch of you, as have ſome eminency above others to ſtudy Knowledge, let the more aged ſtudy it; and let theſe that are younger ſtudy it; If the time of youth go over without it, it's one to many if ever the loſſe be recovered and made up again; and ye that can read, and have time and parts, ſtudy the Knowledge of God; many of you will be very ſad, and dreadful ſpectacles in the great day, when ye ſhall be charged with this, that ye ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Judged Precious Jeſus Chriſt to be of that much worth, as once to put you ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to the ſtudy to know Him; This is no Fable nor Fiction, but a ſad truth, when Men vallue and eſteem any thing, be it Science or Art, they will be at pains, and give diligence to know it, becauſe they prize it. Therefore, for help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:152256:230"/> you to the ſtudy of Knowledge, take theſe few <hi>Directions,</hi> and a <hi>Caveat</hi> or two in the cloſe. 1. Let none put themſelves without the reach of this exhortation; let none ſay, we are too old to learn, if ever ye think to be Juſtified by Chriſt, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge concerns you greatly; It were a commendable thing to ſee aged Men and Women carefully, and conſcienſcious read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Catechiſm; and could we once but get you under the impreſſion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of this, as a Duty, we would think that much were gained. 2. Spend ſome time about this in private weekly; It may be, it were fit that ſome of you did ſo day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ye ſpend much time more idly; If ye knew the hazard of Ignorance, ye would even take ſome ſet time to ſtudy Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and this would not need to be counted any wronging of, or incroaching upon your Chriſtian Liberty; as ye ſtint ſometime for Prayer, may ye not ſtint ſometime to read the Catechiſm or to go to ſome Family, where ye that cannot read your ſelves, may have one to read it to you; And to ſeveral, I may add for a help to this, that ye would take a part of that time, which ye ſpend on Tipling; Is it not obvious, that the perſon that is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Hoſtler-houſe, or in the Tavern, is ordinarly the moſt ſtupidly Ignorant; Tell me whether is it better ſpent time, to take an hour, in two or three dayes, and beſtow it in Reading of the Scriptures, or of ſome good and edifying Book; whereby you may come to Knowledge, and to grow in it; then to take ſeveral hours eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day almoſt, in an Ale-houſe, or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, many of you, as it is well known, will ſit down in ſuch places, at four or five a Clock in the after-noon, and continue till eight or nine at night; how much ye drink I ſpeak not to that; but ſure ye miſpend much precious time, and much debauch your own Spirits: What if by ſuch doings, ye be laying a ground for this a challenge: Sir, you lived in ſuch a place, under ſuch means, and you ſpent your time ſo and ſo; you might have been fred from the guilt of miſpending of your time, and of your ignorance, had you taken a part, or the whole time, and ſpent it in the ſtudy of Knowledge; would not this be better for your Families, better for your Souls, and better for your Bodies? would it not prevent much Sin, and much Reproach? And therefore, if ye lay weight on the good of Soul and Body, beſtow more time in the ſtudy of Knowledge; that Sin of Tipling brings alongſt with it many other Sins and were it not well done to put ſome Dutie, and even this Duty in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, in the place of it? Others of you, that Drink and Tiple not a way ſo much of your time, ye know what time ye ſpend walking on the plain ſtones, and in prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling and talking of idle and unedifying ſubjects; in Drolling and Jeſting, or in ſitting over the Fire; (as we uſe to ſpeak) in your houſes, doing nothing; when will ye take ſome of that time, in ſeeking after Knowledge? Others of you, that follow your Callings, will ye leave your Work a little ſooner then ye uſe to do, on the Saturnday evening; or take the Sabbath afternoon for this Work; ſome of you may ſtudy Knowledge in your Shops; Others may do it in your Houſes, if ye would but give over to walk up and down the Streets, when ye are not all called to do ſo. 3. Make Conſcience to improve the means of Knowledge which ye have; read eſpecially the Bible, and alſo the grounds of Religion, compendiouſly ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Catechiſms leſſer and larger; ye have frequent preaching and Catechiſing at every Dyet, ſtudy to get ſomething; and put every dayes leſſon to another, and this would, through Gods bleſſing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe your Knowledge; For inſtance, take this Leſſon to day; that nothing can Juſtifie, but the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, laid hold on by Faith; take another with you the next day, and let not one dayes Leſſon ſhoulder out another; Let the Huſband and the Wife, the Children, and Servants, compare their Notes, or what they remember of Sermons together; Be often ſpeaking of what ye hear in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, ye have, it may be, ſome Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who would be content that ye come in to them; or, it may be they have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:152256:231"/> who can help you; make uſe of ſuch Means, and Perſons; and that would both help your Knowledge, and evidence your Love (when ſincerely gone about) to the Communion of Saints. 4. Be about the uſe of the Means, with an eye to God for His bleſſing on them; pray to Him for opened eyes, and that He would give you an underſtanding to know Him; There is a ſtupidity in many of you; that makes all that ye hear to go by you, and as it were, to ſlyde off you; So that if it were known, ſome would wonder how there could be ſuch Ignorance amongſt them, that frequently hear the Goſpel. 5. Any light of Knowledge that ye have, be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it in your practice; God ordinarly refuſeth to give more, where that which He hath given is not uſed well; where Men <hi>do not like toretain God in their knowledge,</hi> or where <hi>the truth is detained in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> it provoketh God to give up to a reprobate mind, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>If ye continue in my word</hi> (ſayes Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 8.31, 32.) <hi>then are ye my diſciples indeed, and ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall ſet you free:</hi> And, <hi>John</hi> 7.17. <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi> He that goes conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and conſtantly about the Duties of Holineſſe that he knows (For he muſt make conſcience of all, elſe he will thrive in none) he ſhall increaſe in Knowledge.</p>
            <p>There are alſo ſome things, that more generally conduce to Knowledge, as that, Magiſtrats, Miniſters, Elders, Parents, Maſters of Schools, and Maſters of Families do their reſpective Duties. 1. Then let me deſire you to ſee to the Education of the youth; I mean of the Children of the meaneſt and worſt, to bring them up at Schools; I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>thing of God, or to be civil at leaſt; It would alſo remove the excuſe that we frequently meet with from many, to wit, that they cannot read; And if Parents will not be ſerious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned in this themſelves, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to take ſome courſe to bring up their young Ones, in the Knowledge of God; and truely, if this external eaſie mean be neglected, we can expect little of other means; if this were minded it might be an ornament to the City; and the burden would not be ſo very great, if it were once put to the tryal; will ye that are Parents, and able, be induced to put your Children to the School; if ye be not able, make it known; I know there are ſome who will drink more in one day ſometimes, then would keep their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at the School for many dayes; and I ſuppoſe, that there are but few who can ſay that it is meer neceſſity that lets them; are there any of you that can ſay, ye would fain bring up your Children at School, and ye ſpake to Magiſtrats, or to Church-ſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for help, and that it was refuſed you? It's your part to ſeek for help, that are really unable; And it lyeth on you, to ſee to it your ſelves who are able; And while ye neither do your ſelves, nor ſeek help from others, ye are utterly in-excuſable. 2. I would commend to you the neceſſity of uſing privat means; and that ye would not lay all the weight of your profiting, on your being in the Church, and on your coming to be Catechiſed, or to hear others Catechiſed; but give diligence in privat to come to Knowledge; elſe it will be long ere ye thrive and profit; ye that are in one Family, when ye come home from Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, confer together now and then; and be ſpeaking of what ye hear on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, betwixt Sabbath-dayes; and when ye can get any to anſwer a Doubt, or Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to you, make uſe of the opportunity; though we could go through you all twice a year in Examination and Catechiſing, it will not do your turn, if this be neglected: But as ye would be careful to keep your Children at School, ſo ye would be buſie in your Families, at all Familie Duties; This was wont to be the old way of Gods People, and it would make hearing of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:152256:231"/> profitable. 3. I would commend to you careful attendance on, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious uſe making of the Miniſtry of the Word, the great ordinary mean of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and that ye who are moſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would be thinking of the great conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, if not neceſſity of moe Labourers, If it were known how numerous a People we are; how many hundereds every one who Labours among you, hath under his charge, how little time we have to go through you all particularly; and what abounding Ignorance there is in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the People; I ſuppoſe it would be thought, that the charge of any one of us might require two to diſcharge it ſuitably; which we do not pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

I ſhall cloſe up all with a Caveat, or two. 1. Beware of placing over much Religion in Knowledge; or of being puft up with your Knowledge, when ye attain to any meaſure of it. 2. Beware of count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meer Knowledge to be Faith, but when ye come to know, and diſcern the Object, be ſure that ye take hold of, and reſt upon that which the eye of Faith diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; the Land is to ſay ſo afar off, and within the Vail, caſt therefore the Anchor of Hope there. 3. Beware of thinking, that ye meerly of your ſelves, can acquire any ſound and ſaving Knowledge, or pumpe it out of your ſelves; we bid you not ſtudy the Knowledge of God, as ye ſtudy other common things; There are here requiſit Humility, Fear, Reverence, Love to the Truth, dependence on God; Prayer to Him; and acknowledgement of Him: Let me again ſeriouſly commend this ſtudy to you; and through it, let me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Chriſt unto you, <hi>whom to know is life eternal,</hi> To Him be praiſe for ever.</p>

            <p>IF any thing ſhould be ſtudied with diligence ſure this ſhould be, even to be clear how we may come to be at peace with God; how we may be Abſolved and Juſtified, when we come to reckon before Him; It is no curioſity, ſingly and diligently to make inquity here; although the unfaithfulneſs, and pride of ſome unhappy men, have made the ſtudy of it unpleaſant by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting, and making crooked Gods plain, and ſtraight way of making of our peace with Him, and of our being Juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Him.</p>
            <p>We entered to ſpeak of the great mids, or mean by which this Righteouſneſſe, that Juſtifies a Sinner before God is derived, or, by which we come to have a Title to, and an intereſt in it: And as we have great need to be clear in that Righteouſneſs, which will be a relevant defence before the Tribunal of God's Juſtice, that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not one that wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We ſhew you that by <hi>Knowledge</hi> here is meaned <hi>Faith,</hi> as the Scriptures in the New Teſtament (which hold out Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be by Faith) make clear: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evident, that no meerly ſpeculative Knowledge can intitle to this Juſtification; yet it's called Knowledge. 1.

Becauſe, though there be not an evidence to reaſon in all the things which we believe; yet there is a certainty; and Faith gets this Name, becauſe it makes men certain of theſe things which it takes up, as if it were a Science or Knowledge. 3. To diſtinguiſh it from all other ſorts of Knowledge, and to bound and include it, moſtly, at leaſt within this Object, <hi>Christ,</hi> to ſpeak ſo; Therefore it's ſaid, <hi>by his knowledge,</hi> or as the Word is better rendered, <hi>by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him ſhall my righteous ſervant juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie many;</hi> Which ſhews, that it's not Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge taken largely, that he means of, but Knowledge with reſpect to Chriſt, the great Object of it; as it is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I determined to know nothing among you, but Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified:</hi> And ſaith, <hi>Paul, Philip.</hi> 3.8. <hi>I count all things to be but loſſe, for the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jeſus Chriſt my Lord.</hi> Ye will aſk men, how doth Knowledge and Faith differ, ſeeing, wherever there is Faith, there is Knowledge, though not contrary wayes, wherever there is Knowledge there is Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch a thing in a Notion, and Faith is as the Heart that cloſes with it; Therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. It's ſaid, <hi>With the heart man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves unto righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto Salvation:</hi> I know many take Knowledge for Faith, which at the beſt, is but Hiſtorical Faith; and it's as if a Man who is a drowning, ſhould ſee another caſting in a Rop to him; and he ſees, and knows ſuch a thing, but takes no hold of it, and therefore periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; or, as a Sea-mans diſcovering good ground, to caſt Anchor on, but not caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his Anchor thereon, is expoſed to the violence of the Storm, and ſo ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracked; Knowledge diſcovers the ground, but Faith caſts the Anchor on it: It's much to get you brought up to know, but much more to get you brought to know the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that is betwixt Faith and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; Hence it is, that many ſay, that they believed ever ſince they knew good by ill; becauſe they never looked on Faith but as the knowing, profeſſing, and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a thing to be true; But it's one thing to know a Phyſician, and another thing to imploy him, and to make uſe of his Phyſick.</p>
            <p>We ſpake of this general Doctrine, that Knowledge is a neceſſary thing, as being preſuppoſed to Faith, and particularly the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's called, <hi>The knowledge of him;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's Chriſt Jeſus which is the Object of F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ith; Therefore our ſtudy of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge would eſpecially be with reference to Him: There are <hi>Two</hi> ſorts of Perſons, who are not utterly ignorant, and yet are defective here. 1. There are ſome that love and ſtudy to be Schollars, but Chriſt is not the Object of their Knowledge; it's not the Knowledge ſpoken of here, to be well ſkilled in Philoſophy, in Tongues, in Mathimaticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which we diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend not; nor is it to be able, ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely to diſput and diſcourſe of Divinity, but it's the Knowledge of Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and to ſtudy experimentally, and practically to make uſe of it, and to be cloathed with it; as one ſayes well; <hi>If we know him we know all, and if we know not him though we know all, we know nothing;</hi> Therefore, though <hi>Paul</hi> was a very learned man, and a great Schollar, yet ſayes he, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I determined to know nothing
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:152256:232"/> among you, but Chriſt Jeſus and him crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> A 2d. Sort, are ſuch as want not affection to Truth; nor love to Piety, yet to them the ſtudying of this Doctrine, that concerns Chriſt, and His Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ces, is ſomewhat taſteleſſe, and weariſome; they would be at hearing of Duties, Caſes and Queſtions ſpoken of; though we may, in ſome reſpects ſay, that none of theſe are Objects of Faith, properly, at feaſt as it is Juſtifying; but means and midſes to guide you to make uſe of, and to carry ſuitably to the previledges, that are in the Covenant; Hence many have good affection, that are very ſhallow in their Knowledge of Chriſt, and think but little of Preaching, and Books that hold out the Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, becauſe they come not in ſo cloſſe to practical Things, and Caſes, whereas, If they were better ſettled in the knowledge of Chriſt, it would anſwer all their Caſes, and louſe all their Queſtions and Doubts, let therefore theſe be well looked to, and this by no means be nauſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſlighted; Though Knowledge of the Truths of God be neceſſary; yet it's eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Knowledge of Chriſt that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
            <p>There is another thing ſuppoſed here, that ſerves to clear the Doctrine of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which we ſhall <hi>Obſerve,</hi> ere we ſpeak of Faith it ſelf particularly, becauſe it's antecedent to it, and it's this, That the Goſpel is a neceſſary external mean, for promoving of our Juſtification; for Faith, as we have ſhewed, preſuppoſes Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Knowledge preſuppoſes the Revelation of Gods mind in the Goſpel; and If Knowledge be neceſſary to Faith; then the Goſpel muſt be neceſſary; For it's ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. That <hi>by it the righteouſneſs of God is revealed from faith to faith;</hi> There is great need to obſerve all the ſteps of this Doctrine well, and this among the reſt; The Goſpel is not a thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fication, in <hi>Four</hi> reſpects. 1. Becauſe it layes before us the Object of our Faith, for <hi>in it,</hi> (as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17.) <hi>is the righteouſneſs of God revealled,</hi> &amp;c. and, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.21, 22. it's ſaid, <hi>Now the righteouſneſſe of God without the law is manifeſted,</hi> &amp;c. We would never know the way how a Sinner comes to be at peace with God, and to be Juſtified without the Goſpel. 2. Becauſe, it not only reveals the Object of Faith, but it makes offer of it; and hereby a Sinner that hears the Goſpel, hath warrand to imbrace and make uſe of Jeſus Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe, and to reſt upon it; and therefore, if tentation ſhould ſay to the Sinner, though Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what is that for thee; Faith hath this to reply; The Goſpel calls me, and that warrands me to come to Him, and to make uſe of His Death; the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> as it is, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Is to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call;</hi> And in this reſpect, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is our Right and Evident, whereby we come to have a claim to Chriſt. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God makes uſe of the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for ingaging of Sinners to Chriſt, and for making them to take hold of Him; It's true, that it is not powerful of it ſelf, and without the Spirit; yet it's the ordinary
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:152256:233"/> mean that God maketh uſe of, Therefore, ſayeth the Apoſtle; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The weapons of our warefare are not carnal;</hi> though they be weak in themſelves, yet <hi>they are mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds:</hi> And in this reſpect, the Goſpel not only offers Life, but through Gods bleſſing, as a mean begets Life; and by the Spirit accompanying it, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are ingaged to take hold of Chriſt, and to reſt on Him for Salvation. 4ly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Word being taken hold of, and cloſed with, contains the pronuncing of the Sinners <hi>Abſolvitor,</hi> of His abſolving Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, when it ſayes, <hi>If thou believest, thou ſhalt be juſtified and ſaved;</hi> upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of believing, the Sentence ſtands good to the Believer, <hi>Thou art paſt from death to Life;</hi> There being <hi>no condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 1. <hi>Uſe</hi> Serves to clear that which we hinted at before; in naming this for a cauſe of Juſtification; though it be the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal inſtrumental cauſe,</hi> yet it is a Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The 2. <hi>Uſe</hi> Serves to teach you to put a Pryce on the Goſpel; It's the bane both of prophane ſecure Sinners, and of a ſort of vain and giddy People among us, that they prize not the Preaching of the Goſpel, as the external inſtrumental Cauſe, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curres in the Juſtification of Sinners; but if ever ye be abſolved, ye will be behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to this preached Goſpel; I will not ſay alwayes to the Preaching, but ſure to the Goſpel that is Preached: This on the one hand reproves theſe who will be ready to ſay, that they have Faith, who yet never knew the Goſpel to do them good; and ſuch alſo who ſeldom come to hear, and who never care for preaching; And upon the other hand, it reproves theſe, who, when they fall a Tottering, Reeling, and wavering, and begine to incline to error; caſt at the preaching of the Goſpel, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it may be ſlighted it before in their hearts; whether, when Satan once gets them, he toſſes them in a great meaſure, as he pleaſes, and makes them ſo giddy, by frequent turning about, that they ſcarcely leave to themſelves a foot-broad of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ground to ſtand upon: But as ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the glory of Chriſt, the good of your Souls, and your abſolution before God, eſteem much of the Goſpel; For <hi>it's the power of God to ſalvation;</hi> And if ever ye ye come to Heaven, it will be by this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as the external mean: Theſe Nations that never heard it will think you to be moſt deſperatly wicked, and miſerable, who have had it, and yet ſo unworthily ſlighted it.</p>
            <p>For preſſing of this <hi>Uſe</hi> a little, Take <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three Directions</hi> in reference to it. 1. Walk under the Convictions of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Goſpel; For there is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution without it; It is true, God might have taken another way, but on the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that He hath appointed Faith to be a mids to Juſtification, and that Faith ſuppoſes Knowledge, then certainly Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth ſuppoſe a neceſſity of hearing the Goſpel; ye will never value Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor any other Ordinances of Chriſt, if ye ſee not a neceſſity of them, and know them not to be for your good. 2. Study to know what is the main End and Deſign of, and what is the advantage that is to be had by the Ordinances; many come to the Preaching of the Goſpel, to hear and learn ſome Leſſon, for informing their Judgement, ſome come to get Directions, in ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rence to ſome particular Dutie, ſome to get a doubt looſed, none of which are to be diſſallowed in themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſo far to be commended, but how few come to it, as to a mean to carry on, and bring about their Juſtification; and to bring them out of Black N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ture into a State of Grace? It's the ſum of <hi>Pauls</hi> Preaching, and the end of it, as the Divine Hiſtorian ſhews, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>To open blind eyes,</hi> to turn them from <hi>darkneſs to light, and from the power of ſatan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſſe of ſins, and an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among them that are ſanctified by faith that is in him.</hi> 3. Aim in your practice to carry on this Deſign, even to put a cloſe to the Treaty anent Juſtification betwixt God and you; when ye come to the Preaching, and hears us declare in the name of the Lord, that a believing Sinner hath acceſſe to have his Sin taken away,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:152256:233"/> and to be Juſtified through the imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe; ye would ſtep to, hearing this Proclamation made of the pardon of Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by one of Chriſts Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors in His Name, and accept of, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and cordially cloſe with it, if it were juſt now, at this very occaſion. 4. This would be the great deſign, both of Preachers and Hearers; Of Preachers to follow that way of Preaching moſt, that layes open the miſtery of Faith in Chriſt; and of Hearers to love that way of Preaching beſt; not ſo much that which fills the head with Notions, as that which ſerves to help to cloſe a Bargain betwixt God and you; This was <hi>Pauls</hi> great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in Preaching, as we ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23.24. He no doubt ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght other things; but he compended all in this, or levelled all at this, as the ſcope, and this was his main Deſign in his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Preſſing of other things.</p>
            <p>The 3d. <hi>Uſe</hi> Serves, To make a ſad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of many of you; is this Goſpel the external mean of Juſtification; Then ſee if ye ever knew any benefit ye got by it; ye will belike ſay; that ye are in friendſhip with God? but, how, I pray you, came ye by it? There is little ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nge, to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in your Knowledge, and as little odds in your Practice, ye are as much given to Covetouſneſſe, Tipling Lying, Swearing, Pride, Vanity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r; and are theſe, think ye, the Fruits of Juſtification? do ye think that to be Juſtification, which is neither from the Word, nor conform to it? If God would commend this to your hearts, I think it might alarm you to more ſerious thoughts of your Condition; I put it to your Conſcience, if ye can conceive any difference betwixt you, and theſe that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard the Goſpel? ye are baptized, and hear preachings. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, alace, it's none of theſe that Juſtifies; they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſeful as they lead you forward to the uſe making of Jeſus Chriſt: Again, let me aſk you, what effect hath Preaching upon you? H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th it convinced you of Sin? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Therefore, if ye would make ſure Juſtification indeed, try it by the Word. 1. What was it that put you to ſeek after, Righteouſneſſe, and Juſtification? was ye ever convinced of the need of it? and if ye have been convinced; was it by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word? 2. If ye have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of your Sin and miſery; where ſought ye for a remedy? was ye led in through the Word, to ſeek a Plaiſter to heal that wound of Conviction? 3. What was it that warranted you to take hold of that Word, or that gave you right to it? I know that ye will ſay, that it was Chriſt holden out in the Word, that ye did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take your ſelves to; but what weight laid ye on Gods call in the Goſpel warranding you to lay hold on the Promiſe of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and Pardon of Sin through Chriſt? I know there are many, who, though there had not been a call from God, would have confidently ſtepped forward to the Promiſe; but were ye ever like to <hi>Peters</hi> hearers, <hi>pricked in your hearts,</hi> and made to ſay, <hi>men and brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> Or, being ſome way pricked, was it Gods call holding out, the Promiſe to be <hi>to you, and your children, and to as many as our God ſhall call,</hi> that brought you to reſt on the Promiſe? God hath deſigned preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this end; and ye would try, if ever ye was put to it, to look to Gods call, that g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve you warrand to believe; for there is nothing more certain then this; that wherever Faith is ſicker and well built, it's grounded on Gods call, and doth take His Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hfulneſſe for it's Back-bond (to ſay ſo) and warrand.</p>
            <p>More particularly, we come to ſpeake of this Word, as it reſpects the <hi>inward mean,</hi> or the <hi>inward inſtrumental cauſe,</hi> of Juſtification, which is <hi>Faith;</hi> for there is this order and method. 1. The Sinner is convinced, and made ſenſible of Sin, and brought to reckon for it, in his own Conſcience, before God. 2. There is Chriſts being holden forth interpoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to take on Sinners Debt, and ſatisfy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng the Ju <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ice of God for it, which is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe. 3dly. There is Gods Offer in the Goſpel, holding our Chriſts Righteouſneſſe to loſt Sinners, and calling them to make uſe of it. 4ly. Upon this,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:152256:234"/> there is Faith's receiving of the Offer, and reſting upon Chriſt, and His Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for Life; which (to ſpeak ſo) is the inward inſtrumental Cauſe taking hold of the external, and as I ſaid of Chriſt in it. 5. And laſty follows Gods imputing the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to the Sinner, and abſolving him, by vertue of that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe from the guilt of his Sin, as if he had never Sinned.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking of this inward inſtrumental Cauſe, <hi>Five</hi> things would be cleared, which we ſuppoſe are implyed in the Words. 1. The neceſſity of Faith, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en out, as the Mean, by which Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is come by. 2. The immediat Object of Juſtifying Faith, and that is Chriſts Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or Jeſus Chriſt, as Suffering, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in Soul, and paying our Debt. 3. The Act of this Faith, on this Object; which is not a bare ſpeculative Knowledge, or a meer Hiſtorical Faith, but ſomething that really Acts on Chriſt with reſpect to His Sufferings. 4. The effect of this Faith taking hold on Chriſt, and His Sufferings, and that is Juſtification, which is not the making a Sinner to be Juſt, by inherent Righteouſneſſe, but the Actual abſolving of him from the Guilt of Sin, and from God's Curſe, the changing of his State, and the bringing him from under the Curſe, into good terms with God. 5. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how Faith concurres in proceeding, or bringing about this effect; wherein we have this general; That Faith hath a peculiar influence in the Juſtification of a Sinner, that no good work, nor any other Grace hath; There is none of all theſe things but it is in this miſerably declined generation (wherein the Devil ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf mightily to obſcure Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, as the Lord by the Goſpel doth clear it) contraverted, I ſhall only endeavour to clear the poſitive part, and let you ſee what is Truth in theſe things, whereby ye may be brought to diſcover, and abhore the errors that are contrare thereto.</p>
            <p>The 1. <hi>Doctrine</hi> than is this; That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man can be Juſtified, and Abſolved from the Curſe of God due to him for Sin, there is a neceſſity of Faith in our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; This is clear from the Words, and from what hath been ſaid in the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them up; If it be <hi>by his knowledge,</hi> or <hi>the knowledge of him,</hi> that <hi>many are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> then it cannot be that they are Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before they come to the Knowledge of Him, or from Eternity; only in paſſing, take two or three words of Advertiſement, and then we ſhall confirm the Doctrine. 1. When we ſpeak of Juſtification, it's in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our being abſolved, and fred not from the pollution of Sin, but from the guilt of it, as it makes us obnoxious to the Curſe, the clearing of the effect will clear this more. 2. When we ſpeak of Faith, it's not to be underſtood as it were a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Manifeſtation of our Juſtification; Or, it is not to be underſtood of Faith, in the hight of full aſſurance, and as it is a plezophory; but of Faith, as it is a laying hold upon Chriſt. 3. When we ſpeak of the neceſſity of Faith, in order to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, we mean not, as if there were ſuch an abſolute neceſſity of it, in it ſelf, that God could not do otherwayes, or Juſtifie without it; but we mean a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, in reſpect of the order which God hath laid down, and held forth in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which is by the Knowledge of His Son to Juſtifie many; And from theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations many Arguments of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries are made very little regardable, yea utterly void.</p>
            <p>For Confirmation of the Doctrine then, 1. Conſider theſe Scriptures that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly limit, confine and bound Juſtification, and pardon of Sin to the Perſon that doth believe; So, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The righteouſneſs of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, the juſt ſhall live by faith. Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. <hi>Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22. <hi>God hath concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe by faith of Jeſus Christ might be given to them that believe. Act.</hi> 13.38.39. <hi>Through this man is preached unto you the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, and by him, all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes:</hi>
               <pb n="463" facs="tcp:152256:234"/> Conſult the Scriptures, and we will find, that <hi>Paul</hi> clears both theſe Queſtions. 1. who are Juſtified? All that believe. 2. When are they Juſtified? When they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. 2ly Conſider theſe Scriptures, that place all men before believing, into a ſtate of Wrath, and they will furniſh a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ground for this, as <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth on him, is not condemned: but he that believeth not, is condemned already,</hi> He lyes under the Covenant of Works, and is condemned, as conſidered in himſelf, though God may have a purpoſe to make a change of his ſtate; So, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>You hath he quickned, who were dead in treſpaſses and ſins, wherein, in time paſt ye walked, and were children of wrath even as others,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>We were ſometimes without Chriſt, being alians from the common wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the Covenant of promiſe, without hope, and without God in the world; but now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſometimes were far of, are made near by the blood of Christ;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>By grace are ye ſaved, through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God, not of works, leaſt any man ſhould boaſt,</hi> it's Faith that gives the Title, which we had not before. 3. Conſider, That the Scriptures do expreſly make believing to preceed Juſtification; and make Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be an effect, or rather a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of Faith, to which Faith neceſſarly concurrs; as all theſe places, which ſay, that we are Juſtified by Faith in Chriſt, do clear, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified</hi> by Faith, we have peace with <hi>God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> which place looks on Faiths concurring in Juſtification, with a kind of cauſality, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22.25. <hi>The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all, and upon all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By grace are ye ſaved, through faith;</hi> See more fully to this purpoſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. where the Apoſtle deſignedly as it were, ſets himſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Truth; For ſpeaking of the way, how Sinners come to be Juſtified, and as it were entring in the Debate, he ſays; <hi>Knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, even as we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt that we might be justified by the faith of Christ;</hi> In which place we have three things conſiderable, to make out the point. 1. He compares the concurring of Faith, to Juſtification, in the Covenant of Grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, to the concurring of Works to Juſtification, or to the obtaining of Life, in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works; as Works did Juſtifie, in the Covenant of Works, ſo does Faith in the Covenant of Grace; Now certainly the performing of Works, in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, behoved to go before Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication that way, therefore the want of Works made <hi>Adam</hi> to come ſhort of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Works. 2. He looks on Faith, and ſpeaks of it, as concurring to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, with a reſpect to Chriſt, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looks on it in this matter, as a Grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in, and by it ſelf; but as acting on Chriſt in a peculiar manner. 3. In ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words, he ſayes, <hi>We have believed in Christ Jeſus that we might be juſtified;</hi> which clearly implyes, that they could not be Juſtified before they believed, and we may well, and eaſily gather, that the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication here meant, is that which is real and actual, and not the declaring of a man to be Juſtified to Himſelf; elſe Works might declare a man to be Juſtified to himſelf, as well as Faith; But he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhes Faith and Works here, and oppoſes the one to the other.</p>
            <p>The 1. <hi>Uſe,</hi> Serves for clearing of this Truth, That there is a neceſſity of Faith's taking hold of, and reſting on Chriſt, ere we can be abſolved, and Juſtified; And ſo both theſe Errors of <hi>Antinomians</hi> fall to the ground, 1. That, by which they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that theſe who are Juſtified, were Juſtified from Eternity; and were never under God's Curſe: And 2. That Faith is not neceſſary to the attaining of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but only to a Perſons knowing that he is Juſtified; and ſo they ſay, that Faith enters us not in the Covenant; which is falſe, it being the terms, or condition, on which God propoſeth, and promiſeth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in his Covenant, as is clear, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>Whoſoever believes ſhall not be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſhall have everlaſting life,</hi> and,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:152256:235"/> 
               <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believes, and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> with this oppoſition, <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned;</hi> Faith being it which enters us in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; For, either Sinners are Juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be in Covenant with God, which is an abſurdity, and inconſiſtent with Gods Covenant, or it's by Faith that they are entered in the Covenant: There is here alſo a clear diſcovery, and confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a 3d. Error of <hi>Antinomians,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of Faith, That it is Perſons believing, that they are Juſtified; No, not ſo, For as the Apoſtle ſayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>We have believed that we might be juſtified,</hi> We believe, in order to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And to ſay, as <hi>Antinomians</hi> do, would do much to infer univerſality of Juſtification, as well as of Redemption; It's Gods mercy, that this Error is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and that we have His Truth pointing out to us, that Juſtification muſt have Faith going before it, and alongſt with it.</p>
            <p>The 2d. <hi>Uſe</hi> Serves to demonſtrat the abſolute neceſſity of believing, and taking hold of Chriſt; If Abſolution and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be neceſſary, Faith muſt be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; And therefore, if Chriſt be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, and if by Him, all that believe are Juſtified; Take hold then, I beſeech you of the Offer, receive, embrace, cloſe, with it, and let your very hearts open to it; without which ye can never expect to be Juſtified, before the Tribunal of God, Now let God Himſelf bleſſe the ſame Word to you, through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p>The 1. <hi>Uſe</hi> then is, To let you ſee the abſolute neceſſity of believing in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and that it is as neceſſary for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of our Juſtification, as Chriſts dying is; For our Juſtification is an effect flowing from ſeveral Cauſes, and the want of any of them will mar it; There muſt neceſſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be a concurrance of them all, to bring it about; And therefore, though their be an excellent worth in Chriſts Righteouſneſſe; yet there is a neceſſity of Faith, to lay hold upon it, and to make it ours; Gods order in the Covenant bears this out; wherein he hath knit the Promiſe of Pardon of Sin, and of Juſtification to Faith, and reſting on Chriſt; and there is good reaſon for it, As, 1. The Lord will have a Sinner to know what he is obliged to Chriſt, which Faith contributs much unto; For Faith ſtands not in the way of the freedom of Juſtification, but rather commends it; for the Lord would have us know, that we hold our Life of Him; and not to receive Him by Faith, is an evidence of higheſt preſumption; Therefore it's ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>It is by faIth that it might be of grace;</hi> God hath choſen this way, that the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of His Grace, in pardoning of Sin may be ſeen. 2. The Lord by this, lets the unbeliever know, that the reaſon of his own ruine is of himſelf; There ſhall not be one unbeliever found, that ſhall have it to ſay, that the blame lay on God, or on Chriſt; becauſe the offer was made to them on condition of receiving it by Faith, and they not performing the condition, their Guilt is aggreged by their ſlighting of the offer: It's true, that we are not now dealling with them, who down-right deny the Truth of this Doctrine; but, alace, what better are they, who do in their practice deny it, and live ſenſleſly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely under the Goſpel? We conceive that there are <hi>Three</hi> ſorts of Perſons, that have need of a Word to be ſpoken to them here. 1. Such as live careleſly, and ſecurely (as we juſt now ſaid) as if God required nothing of them at all; as they were born, they know not how, ſo they live, they know not how; and when they are preſſed to a change of their ſtate, and way, they make excuſes, partly from the ſinfulneſſe of their Nature, that they can do nothing, partly from the abundant Grace of God, that He muſt do all; But it will never excuſe you, that ye wanted Grace, and had a Sinful Nature, for whom I pray, can ye blame for it? ye that make a bachel of His mercy, if ye continue to do ſo, ſhall never get good of it; For He hath ſaid, that He will Juſtifie, and ſave none but the Believer, There is none other that hath the promiſe of Pardon, it is not made to any thing that is to be brought forth, or done by your own ſtrength, or by the ſtrength of Nature, or of free-will; But God hath laid down this order and method, and made it known that ye ſhould believe, and receive the offer of Chriſt in the Goſpel; renunce your own Righteouſneſſe, and betake you to Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe, otherwayes ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, on good ground, expect to be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. 2. Others will ſet about many things that are good; but the Work of believing they can never be brought to mind, or own, they will make a ſort of Conſcience of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, of keeping the Church, of reading the Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to give obedience to the Command of Believing they mind it not, they can live, and die without it; This was the woful, and Soul-ruining prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, as we are told, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. They took much pains to come by Righteouſneſſe, but <hi>they attained it not, becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law, for they ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at that ſtumbling ſtone;</hi> when they had gone part of the way, as it were, and come to the Stone of believing, there they fell and brake their necks; Hence there are many who promiſe Heaven to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and think that they have done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for it, who yet never laid hold on Chriſt for their Juſtification; but let me tell you, that though you could go the greateſt length in Holineſſe that ever any did ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, it will not avail you, if ye neglect Faith in Chriſt; I ſay not this to diſſwade you from the Duties of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:152256:236"/> God forbid; but to divert you from ſeeking Juſtifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ation by them; ſtudy the Duties of Holineſſe, but ſeek alwayes, by any means to be found in Chriſt, and in His Righteouſneſſe, and not in the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of your Duties, as to your Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; It is true none that have any tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable meaſure of Knowledge, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſe down right, that they lean to holy Duties; yet many are ſo ignorant, that they cannot diſtinguiſh betwixt Faith and Works; and there are not a few, who have a hope of Heaven, ſuch as it is, who n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver knew any thing of the exerciſe of believing. A 3d. Sort are theſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome common favours that they have received, as evidences of Gods care and kindneſſe, conclude their Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; It may be ſome have had now, and then deep convictions, or have win to Tears in Prayer, or at a Sermon; Others it may be, have had ſome joy now and then, at hearing the Word; Others will, it may be dream of ſuch, and ſuch Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and have, as they ſuppoſe, a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them in their ſleep, and ſome joy will follow on it, when they are awaked; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may have met with many deliveries by Sea and Land, and God hath dealt wel with them, and their Children, in external things, but, alace, theſe things may befall unbelievers; not one of them, nor all of them together, if there be no more, will Juſtifie; ye would rather try theſe things whether they be found, and evidences of ſpecial Love or not, by your believing; If they have Faith in Chriſt carried along with them, It's well; If ye can ſay, that <hi>after ye believed, ye were ſealed with the holy ſpirit of promiſe,</hi> and that your joy follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon your cloſing with, and reſting upon Chriſt, ye have no reaſon to queſtion it; but where ſuch taſtes goes before, and are without believing; it's ſuſpect-like; there are many of you that have multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of things, that ye lean to, beſide Chriſt; and never ſeriouſly put your ſelves to the tryal, whether ye be indeed fled to Him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Uſe,</hi> We would commend this to you, as a ground of Tryal of your ſelves, if ye be Juſtified; if ye have ſeriouſly taken with your ſin, and embraced God's offer of the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and reſted on it; make this once ſure, that ye have been ſenſible of Sin, that ye have been beaten from your own Righteouſneſſe, and that ye have fled to Jeſus Chriſt, and cloſed with His Righteouſneſſe offered in the Goſpel; then this will natively follow, that by His Knowledge thou art Juſtified; His Word ſpeaks it out plain to thee: It may be that ſome think this to be a broad mark, and that others will think it nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; Yet it's a ſolid mark, and no other thing is or can be a mark, but as it implyes this; though ſome may preſumptuouſly gather from it a broad concluſion, yet it will be found to be as ſtraining and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mark, when well conſidered, as other marks and evidences are, that we cannot at firſt ſo eaſily lay hold upon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we would ſay, that it's not every one that thinks he believes, but it's ſuch as real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, who have this evidence; and for preventing of miſtakes, we ſhall follow this evidence of Juſtification, to wit, Faith, to the very riſe of it. 1. It ſuppoſes a Charge, and Summonds as it were given to the Perſons, to appear before God. 2. There is a Sentence diſcovered, ſtanding againſt them, and over their heads, by the Covenant of Works, now what can ye ſay to theſe <hi>Two?</hi> where I deſire you not ſo much to ſpeak your light, as your prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and experience; what a Charge, or Summonds was put in your hands? Have ye read the Lybel of your Sins? And have ye ſeen the breaches of the Law, and your lyableneſs to the Curſe of God for the ſame? If ſo, then what means the good opinion that many of you have of your ſelves? This is even the thing that the Apoſtle ſayeth of himſelf before his converſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9: <hi>Before the law came, I was alive, but when the commandement came, ſin revived, and I died;</hi> That is before the charge was put in my hand, and I ſummoned to appear before Gods Bar, I had a good opinion of my ſelf, and I thought that all was well; but when I came to take up the Law in the Spiritual Meaning, and broad extent of it,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:152256:236"/> I ſaw my ſelf loſt and gone, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat fell; Theſe <hi>Three</hi> then uſually preceed Faith. 1. That a perſon hath had a good opinion of himſelf. 2. That this perſon is Summoned or Charged to anſwer at Gods Bar. 3. That the perſon is made to paſſe Sentence on himſelf, as loſt and undone, by reaſon of the Laws Sentence, and Curſe ſtanding over his head unrepealled; Now, how hath it been with you, as to theſe? The moſt part are quite of another diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition then <hi>Paul</hi> was; They think they are well enough, becauſe they never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their rotten condition; but try well how it is with you; go in and ſee if ever ye diſcovered in your ſelves. 1. An inclination to eſtabliſh your own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. 2. Was ye ever under a work of the Law humbling you? and 3. Was ye ever, in your own apprehenſion loſt? If ſo, then ye are ſuch as Chriſt came to call. 2ly. In the next room conſider what ye betook your ſelves to, for anſwering that Charge, and for a remedy of that loſt condition; there is no remedy, but the offer of Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe in the Goſpel; Some being charged wirh Guilt, betakes themſelves to Prayer, and that is well done in ſo far; but if ye hold there, and go no further, it's not right; It's here, as it was with theſe, who lived under the Law, who, when they had Sinned, made uſe of Sacrifices; and the greateſt part held there, and went no further; whereas the believer looked through the Sacrifices to Chriſt; So, if ye hold at Prayer, and other Duties, and go no further, theſe will not profit you; but know ye what it is to go to Prayer, and in Prayer to go to Chriſt, and reſt on his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for your acceptance? I fear there be great ignorance here; The moſt part know not what they have done, when they were charged; or, if they did any thing, they prayed; or, if they went any further on, they looked to the promiſe of Gods mercy; but that is not far enough gone; How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch are there, who have made their Prayer their only interceſſour, and have preſumed to ſtep in on God's mercy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Mediator. 3. Suppone that ye have betaken your ſelves to Chriſt, as to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; come on, and try how your union hath been made up with him; where did ye ſeek and find him? Chriſt Jeſus is to be found in the Goſpel, in the Miniſtry of the Word; Therefore that is put in on good reaſon in the definition of Faith given to us in the Catechiſm, <hi>That its a reſting on him, as he is offered in the Goſpel;</hi> but I fear and ſuppoſe that many have another Chriſt (to ſpeak ſo) whom they have gotten without knowing, or making any uſe of the Word, or offer of the Goſpel, <hi>which is the power of God for ſalvation to them that believe.</hi> 4. Wherewith did ye take hold on him? or how did ye act on him? was it by Faith or not? There are many, who act on him as they think by Prayer, not as the meritorious Cauſe, but as the efficient cauſe of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, praying for pity and pardon from Him; but this is not to take hold of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe by Faith; Others think, that if they can love and ſerve Him, and pleaſe Him with Duties, they will ingage Him to give them pardon; and in this they have (to ſpeak ſo) an under hand Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works; They will do ſomething to pleaſe the Mediator, and wherein they come ſhort, they expect that he will make it up; and this is very ordinary in practice; If ye aſk ſome, what hope have ye of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? They will anſwer, through Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, and that is good, in ſo far; but aſk them again, how they will get it? they will anſwer, that they will do what they dow or may, and they hope that He will pity them; ye would look in upon your own hearts, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not ſecretly making ſomething of this kind the ground of your title to Chriſt, and of your Juſtification; And yet all this may be, and often is in them that will not ſtoop to the way of Grace, nor ſubmit themſelves to the Righteouſneſſe of God: They will ſpeak of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and yet they will needs give Him ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; and ſo come never really to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their own Righteouſneſſe, and to flee unto His, and to hold it up as their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence before God; Take but an impartial view of theſe ſteps, and many of you, who ſuppoſe that ye are believers, will not be
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:152256:237"/> found to be ſo, nor Juſtified before God; becauſe ye lay nor claim to it by Faith, but as it were by the works of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. There is here ground for all that neglect Chriſt, and do not by Faith take hold of Him, to look for a moſt dreadful Sentence; and ground for others, who ſeek Righteouſneſſe through Faith, to look for a moſt comfortable Sentence; 1. Then is this a Truth, that Juſtification is through Faith in Chriſt? then many of you are not Juſtified; And if the Lord prevent it not, ye will never be Juſtified; If ſo, then it muſt be a moſt dreadful thing not to believe; If ye would know what is your condition, ye may read it, <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 36. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and he ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him;</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>As many as are of the works of the law, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe; For it is written, curſed is every one that continues not in all things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of the law to do them:</hi> If ye really believed this, many of you would be under horror, to hear what a ſad condition ye are in, even <hi>condemned already,</hi> and having the Wrath and Curſe of God <hi>abiding on you;</hi> becauſe the Word curſeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth all that are not in Chriſt by Faith: This, I fear belongs to very many, who are altogether ſecure and careleſſe, and yet are in reputation amongſt us; And is it not very ſad to be profeſſing fair, to have the offer of life and to be treating with God about your peace, and yet to be ſtill in the State of enmity with Him; So that if death were within twenty four hours march to you; you could have nothing to expect, but the ratifying of this Sentence of Gods curſe upon you; We are ſure there is as much in this, as might in reaſon put you by all means to ſtudy. 1. To be Believers, for without Faith ye are never over the borders of Gods curſe; which may lay a chaſe to you, and put you to the neceſſity of fleeing to Chriſt for refuge 2. To take ſome pains to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye be in the Faith, as the Apoſtle exhorts. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the faith, prove your ſelves, know ye not your own ſelves, how that Christ is in you, except ye be reprobats?</hi> His meaning is, know ye not, that this is a truth, that ye are in a reprobat, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approven condition, except Chriſt be in you; and Chriſt is in none, but in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; If ſo, ought ye not to try your ſelves, if ye be in the Faith, if ye be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; There is no ordinary way to win to the ſure and comfortable Knowledge of it but by tryal; and if ye be not Believers, is there not reaſon, and is it not of your concernment, to endeavour by tryall to come to the Knowledge of it: As this is ground of terror to the unbeliever; ſo it's ground of notable conſolation to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, who, if he were even put to the reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning with <hi>Paul, I was a blaſphemer, a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter, injurious,</hi> yet here is hope for him, that he ſhall be found in Chriſt, not having his own Righteouſneſſe, but Chriſts; believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt will obtain Juſtification to ſuch a perſon; His Righteouſneſſe taken hold of, and put on by Faith, is as pleaſing, and acceptable to God, as the unrighteouſneſſe of the Sinner is diſpleaſing to him; This was it that made <hi>David</hi> to ſing ſweetly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, whoſe ſin is covered, bleſsed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth no iniquity;</hi> to wit, through the imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe; as the Apoſtle clears; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. As the firſt branch of the Uſe ſhew the neceſſity of Faith, for Chaſing Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Chriſt; ſo this branch is a ſweet motive to draw them to Him; and if there were moe ſenſible Sinners amongſt us, whoſe own Righteouſneſs miſgives them, and who are brought to that paſs, that the <hi>Jaylor</hi> and <hi>Peters hearers</hi> were in, crying out, <hi>what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> This word <hi>believe in the Lord Jeſus, and ye ſhall be ſaved,</hi> would make them come in cheerful, as he did, from the brink, not only of Temporal, but of Eternal Death; It's this Faith, by which we have acceſs to ſtand before God; ye would therefore be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly intreated to betake your ſelves to it, and to Jeſus Chriſt by it, for your pardon, and peace, even for your Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Conſider theſe Words, as they hold out the Object of Juſtifying Faith, which
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:152256:237"/> is the great thing in them, even to diſcribe Juſtifying Faith, as to it's Object, and Effect, and in it's concurring to produce this effect; And here there are miſtakes, and errors, both in the doctrinal and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical part of all theſe. 1. The Object of it then is Him, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the knowledge <hi>of him,</hi> or the Faith of Him, or Faith in Him, as other Scriptures have it: Or, looking more nearly to the words, it's Faith in Him, as Suffering, as Satisfying for Sin, as in Soul-travel, bearing our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Hence <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That Chriſt Jeſus His Rightnouſneſſe holden forth in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of free Grace, is the native and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Object, that ſaving and juſtifying Faith takes hold of, and reſts upon; or to the ſame purpoſe, the ſaving Grace of Faith, that Juſtifies, is that Faith that does peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly apply and reſt upon Chriſt Jeſus hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en forth in Gods promiſe in the Goſpel, as the Righteouſneſſe of a Sinner that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves on him; hence the Prophet calleth it here, Not Knowledge more generally taken, but the <hi>knowledge of him,</hi> and that, as He is holden out in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> to wit, as ſurety for Sinners; and ſuffering for their Debt: This will be clear, if we conſider all theſe Scriptures, that make offer of the pardon of Sin; for it's offered not in the condition of Faith, in a more general No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, but on condition of Faith, <hi>in him;</hi> So, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.22, 24, 25. <hi>The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſse of God, which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt; whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood. Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Christ. John</hi> 1.12. <hi>To as many as received him, he gave power to become the Sons of God, even to as many as believe in his name;</hi> Where the Faith that hath the Promiſe of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the priviledge of Adoption annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, is called the <hi>receiving of Christ, and believing on his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may alſo be cleared, and confirmed by good reaſon, 1. Faith does not Juſtifie as it's coſidered in it ſelf as an Act, but as it relates to, and units with Chriſt, as the meritorious cauſe of Juſtification. 2. Neither does Faith Juſtifie as it looks to every Object which the Word holds forth; But as it reſpects Chriſt, offered in the Goſpel, whom it receiveth; becauſe there is no other thing that can bear the Souls weight and burden; Therefore he, as offered in the Goſpel, muſt be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith, as it's ſaving and juſtifying. 3. The terms of the Covenant, and Gods offer clears it alſo; For Gods offer of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not on theſe terms, that a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhall believe his Word in the general, but that he believe on His Son whom He hath ſent, and receive Him as theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cited before, to wit, <hi>John</hi> 3.16.18. and <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. Shew where the terms are ſet down, whereon God offers Life to Sinners. 4. If we could imagine a man to have all Knowledge, and all Faith, if Faith Act not on Chriſt as Redeemer, Cautioner, and Surety for ſuch as come to Him, it will not avail us, nor be counted to us for Righteouſneſſe; which may alſo confirm this truth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> are ſuch as ſerve both to clear the nature of Faith, and to direct us in our practice.</p>
            <p>The 1. <hi>Uſe.</hi> Then ſerves, to clear the Truth; as the <hi>Papists</hi> corrupt many Truths, ſo they corrupt this Truth concerning the nature of Juſtifying and Saving Faith, in theſe <hi>Three,</hi> 1. In the <hi>Object.</hi> 2. In the <hi>Subject.</hi> 3. In the <hi>Act</hi> of it: As for the <hi>Object</hi> of this Faith, they make it to be every thing that God reveals; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they take in their own <hi>Traditions:</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe they give not Faith a Cauſality in Juſtification, nor the capacity and place of a thing, acting on Chriſt particularly; but take it in as a common Grace, or at the beſt, as a Grace that is Radical; and gives Life to other Graces; but never as taking hold of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; which quite overturns the way of Juſtification through Faith in Him; for Faith that layeth not hold on His Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe cannot Juſtifie; and their making the Object of Faith to be ſo broad, doth ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat both the immediat merit of Chriſts
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:152256:238"/> Righteouſneſſe, and the exerciſe of Faith on it. 1. Then we grant that there is a Hiſtorical Faith requiſit, as to the whole Word of God; yet we ſay that the Faith that Juſtifies, is properly that Faith that ſingles out the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and takes hold of it; So that it's not our believing, that the World was made, that there will be a day of Judgement; nor our believing that a Saviour of Sinners is come into the World, and hath ſuffered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Juſtifies; but it's a cloſing with, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of, and a reſting on that Saviour, a ſingling out of the Promiſe that makes offer of him; (as for inſtance, where it's ſaid, <hi>If thou believe on the Lord Jeſus thou ſhall be ſaved</hi>) and pitching on that, and reſting on him holden out in the Promiſe; Faith gives the Soul footing here, whereas before it's caſe was very deſperat. 2. We may clear what we are to look to, as the object of Juſtifying and Saving Faith, by our putting in theſe <hi>Three</hi> Words, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to wit, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus his Righteouſneſſe holden forth in the promiſe of Gods free grace in the Goſpel;</hi> and which are needful to be taken in, though it be not alwayes neceſſary, that we be explicit ln the uptaking of them. 1. There is need of taking in <hi>Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> becauſe it's our defence at the Bar of Gods Juſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e; even as a Debitor whoſe Debt the Cautioner hath payed, hath that to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer when he is charged for it, that his Cautioner hath payed it. 2. There is need to take in this, <hi>Holden forth in Gods promiſe in the goſpel;</hi> becauſe, though Chriſt be the Object of Juſtifying Faith, and His Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe be the ground of the Souls defence before God; yet Gods Promiſe muſt be looked on by Faith, for the uſe making of Chriſt, and His Righteouſneſſe, and as a warrand to reſt on Him, and to expect Juſtification through Him; and thus Faith hath Chriſts fulneſſe, or His full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Satisfaction for Righteouſneſſe, and Gods Faithfulneſſe impledged, that the Believer ſhall be accepted through it; And its on this ground, that Faith ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times looks on God as <hi>Able,</hi> ſometimes as <hi>Faithful;</hi> Therefore it's ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermost;</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Sarah judged him faithful who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed:</hi> whereupon there is a cloſing with the offer in the Promiſe, and a looking to obtain that which is Promiſed, as if they had a Righteouſneſſe of their own; and this the Apoſtle calls <hi>the law of faith, Rom.</hi> 3.27. Becauſe to Juſtification there is beſide the payment of the Debt, a Law declaring the man to be abſolved, requiſit; and the Sinner having Gods offer and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that upon his accepting of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, he ſhall be Juſtified, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs that his Debt is payed by his Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, and that therefore he ought to be, and is accordingly abſolved; And though Gods Promiſe be not ſo properly a Law, yet the Apoſtle calleth it ſo; and it is a ſolid defence to the Soul that is fled to Chriſt; Who may thus reaſon, I have no Righteouſneſſe of my own, but Chriſts Righteouſneſſe by Proclamation, is offered to me in the Goſpel, and I have heartily received it, and cloſed with it, and God is faithfull to make good His Promiſe to me; and this looks to Chriſt as He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Goſpel. 3. There is need to put in this word, <hi>The promiſe of Gods free grace;</hi> becauſe hereby the Sinner is made to ſee whence the Promiſe came, and of what nature it is, and gives ground to take hold of the Promiſe, and of that which is made offer of in it; the Promiſe is of free Grace, therefore it's alwayes called the Covenant of Grace; So <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>It's of faith, that it might be by grace to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed:</hi> For if it were not of Grace, the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner would never think himſelf ſure, nor would he know if ſuch a Sinner might take hold of ſuch a Promiſe; but conſidering that the Promiſe is of Grace and His ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation is of Grace, as is often repeated, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1, 2, and 3. <hi>Chapters:</hi> Theſe <hi>Three</hi> are the great warrand that a Sinner hath to roll himſelf over on, a compleat Mediator; a faithful God promiſing to anſwer all grounds of Fears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doubts and Jealouſneſs; and free Grace which anſwers all Challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that may come in to hinder his cloſing with, and his reſting on the Promiſe; for
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:152256:238"/> if it ſhould be ſaid, How dareſt thou lay hold upon the Promiſe? The anſwer is, it's free, it's not <hi>the mount that may not be touched,</hi> but it's <hi>Jeſus the mediator of the new covenant,</hi> &amp;c. It's Grace that is the Riſe, the End, and the Condition of it: Theſe are the <hi>Three</hi> on which Faith yeelds it ſelf to Chriſt, and which are the Object of it, on which it dar hazard, and on which it does hazard; and theſe <hi>Three</hi> are revealled in the Goſpel of the Grace of Him that is Faithful, and cannot deny Himſelf: May we not then ſay, O!

            <p>THe Knowledge of Chriſt was wont to be much thought of by the People of God, and to be in high eſtimation among them; and we may ſay, we wote well it was deſervedly ſo, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is by His Knowledge, that Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication was derived to them, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryved to us; This is that which the Lord is clearing by the Prophet here; to wit, how the benefit of Chriſts Sufferings, and Purchaſe may be deryved, and communicat unto a Sinner; Which theſe words (though
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:152256:239"/> but few) as purpoſly made uſe of, to clear; even that His Sufferings ſhould not be in vain, but that He ſhould ſow a Seed, and though that Seed ſhould not be <hi>all</hi> Men, yet they ſhould be <hi>manie;</hi> and the way how theſe many ſhould come by the benefit of His Sufferings is alſo held forth; and that is, <hi>By his knowledge,</hi> who is the Righteous Servant: We ſhew you, that this doth upon the matter look to Faith, and is meant of it; and confirmed it by other paralel Scriptures, which ſay, that <hi>through faith in him, all that believe are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;</hi> we came alſo to ſpeak of this Faith which Juſtifies, and did propoſe <hi>Five</hi> things to be ſpoken of concerning it, (and indeed if any thing be of concerment, this is; if a right to Chriſt and His purchaſe be of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, then ſure it muſt be of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to know how we come by that Right) 1. The neceſſity of it. 2. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it. 3. The act of it. 4. The effects that flow from it. 5. The manner of it's concurring in the attaining of Juſtification; We ſpoke of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> to wit, of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Faith; and ſhew that though there be a full Satisfaction laid down to merit and procure Juſtification, yet it's applyed to none but to Believers, and not till they believe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſpoke alſo to this, That Faith, as it Juſtifies, looks not to all the Word of God, as it's Object, but mainly, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to Chriſt, and to the Word only, in ſo far as it holds out Chriſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Offers of Gods Grace, as it's here called the Knowledge of Him, or Faith in Him.</p>
            <p>We now proceed to hint a Word for clearing of a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> and it's a new and very late one, to wit, whether Juſtifying Faith layes hold on Chriſt as a Saviour and Prieſt only, or whether it layes hold on Him not only, as a Prieſt to ſave, but alſo as a King to command? though this doth not look at firſt bluſh to be of any great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that ſuch an inconſiderable-like difference is not to be ſtood upon; yet we will find that this laſt wants not it's own influence on altering the common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and (as we conceive) the ſolid received Doctrine, concerning the way of Juſtification; if we ſhould admit it: And therefore we anſwer the <hi>Question</hi> from the <hi>Text.</hi> That Chriſt conſidered as ſuffering, and bearing our Sins, and ſo as offering Himſelf in a Sacrifice, is the Object that Juſtifying Faith, as ſuch takes hold of; Therefore the connexion of theſe two is clear in this <hi>verſe, He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul and be ſatisfied; and by his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall many be juſtified;</hi> and again it is ſubjoyned, as the reaſon why many ſhall by Faith in Him be juſtified; <hi>Becauſe he ſhall bear their iniquities;</hi> By the Knowledge of Him that Offered Himſelf in a Sacrifice, many are Juſtified; and many are Juſtified, becauſe He bears their iniquities; which will infer this, that Faith conſiders Him as ſatisfying for the iniquities of His People, in it's acting on Him for Juſtification, and Pardon of Sin; it is true, Chriſts Offices are not divided, and it is not true Faith if it take not hold of Him, and make not uſe of Him in all His Offices; but as there are ſeveral evils in us, which His Offices do meet with, and are ſuited unto, ſo ſhould Faith take hold of them, and make uſe of them for curing, and removing of theſe evils; He is King, Prieſt, and Prophet, and Faith takes hold of Him, as a King to command, and ſubdue us to Himſelf, as a Prophet to illuminat us, and cure our blindneſſe, and as a Prieſt to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice, and to procure the pardon of Sin, as we are not to ſeperat, ſo we are not to confound theſe, we uſe not to ſay that Chriſt as a Prophet doth Juſtifie us, nor that as a Prieſt He doth illuminat us; no more ſhould we, nor can we well ſay, that as a King He ſatisfied Juſtice for us; The ſame bleſſed God is Wiſe, Righteous, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Faithful, Juſt, Merciful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet He is diverſly conſidered in reſpect of our conceiving and uſe-making according to our need; ſo is it here. For clearing whereof, take theſe grounds. 1. The Scripture ſpeaks of, and points Chriſt out in His Sufferings, as the Object of Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth for a propitiation through faith in his blood:</hi> where the Blood of Chriſt, and He
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:152256:239"/> as Suffering is propoſed as Faiths Object; ſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>We preach Chriſt crucified,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. <hi>We have an advocat with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> where He is holden forth in His Sufferings, as the propitiation that Faith layeth hold on, <hi>John</hi> 3.14. <hi>As Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs, ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth on him,</hi> &amp;c. Where Chriſt lifted up, and as dying on the Croſs, is made the Object of Juſtifying Faith; even as the brazen Serpent lifted up was the Object that they looked to, when they were ſtung, and cured. 2. It's alſo clear from the Laws, lybelling and charging us for the Debt of our Sin, that makes us ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to condemnation, and Faith being the mean of our Juſtification, and abſolution from the Debt, it muſt needs look to the Cautioners paying of our Debt, and ſo anſwering the Charge; which was done in His Death, for He payed our Debt, Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed the Penalty of the Law, and came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curſe in ſuffering Death; as is clear <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. the 10. <hi>v.</hi> being compared with <hi>v.</hi> 13. So, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the Charge of Gods elect it is God, that juſtifies, who ſhall condemn? it is Chriſt that died;</hi> which is brought in as Faith's anſwer to the charge; The charge cannot be denyed, for we are guilty of ſo many Sins, and therefore lyable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; but ſaith Faith, Chriſt hath died: It propoſes Him dying as a Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for anſwering the charge, and for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of abſolution. 3. Chriſt as Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Satisfying Juſtice, is our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and therefore muſt be the object of Faith, as it's Juſtifying whereupon it pleads an abſolution before the Throne of God; So that when we come to plead and found our Defence before Gods Throne; it is not on this, that Chriſt is a King, and hath ſubdued us; but it is on this gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d; That He is our Prieſt, and hath ſatisfied Juſtice for us, and payed our Debt, and procured a diſcharge to us; So the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſts Sufferings, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. Sayes, <hi>That he blotted out the hand-writing of ordinances that was againſt us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his croſs;</hi> It's Chriſt as Suffering that is the ground of our Peace, and therefore Faith as Juſtifying muſt ſo conſider Him: Though we deſire to move nothing needleſly, yet laying it once for a ground; That Juſtifying Faith layes hold on Chriſt as a King, This will follow as a conſequence, and as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as a reaſon, That our obedience to Chriſt, as a King hath the ſame influence, and the ſame Cauſality in our Juſtification, that Faith's reſting on Chriſt's Satisfying for as a Prieſt hath; becauſe as Chriſts Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office gives us a warrand to reſt upon Him for Juſtification, ſo would His Kingly Office, (if it were the Object of Juſtifying Faith as ſuch) when taken hold of for our obedience: We have touched on this. 1. That ye may ſee the warrantableneſs of this Doctrine which is received in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt, and that ye may conſider Chriſt as <hi>the high priest of your profeſſion,</hi> and plead Juſtification from His Sacrifice, acting Faith, upon Him accordingly. 2. That we may put a Bar againſt the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of Juſtification by Works under one pretext or another, how ſpecious ſoever; ſeing the Scripture ſo directly oppoſes Faith and Works in our Juſtification; For if we once admit that Chriſt, as King, is the Object of Juſtifying Faith as ſuch, it would overturn the diſtinct way of Faith's acting upon Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, for anſwering the Charge put in the Sinners hand by the Law; and when the ſoul getteth a challenge for Sin, would put it to look what obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it hath given to Chriſt, as a King to anſwer that challenge, or charge by; and would in the ſame manner alſo put the Soul to gather the ground of it's peace from the one, as well as from the other, that is both from Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and from it's own obedience, not only as an evidence, but a ſocial cauſe, or not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to it's own ſenſe, but as to the effect: But we leave this as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e is ground enough of ſtumbling, becauſe of our ignorance, and blindneſs; there ſhould, and that very unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be ſuch new occaſion of ſtumbling to Souls caſt in the way of Faith.</p>
            <pb n="474" facs="tcp:152256:240"/>
            <p>We come now to ſpeak of the <hi>Act</hi> of Faith as Juſtifying, called here <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>the knowledge of him,</hi> to ſhew that it points at Juſtifying Faith; for if it were not ſo, it were the ſame with common Knowledge, whereby we believe any Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Bible; but this being Juſtifying Knowledge, it muſt be Knowledge of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind: We ſhall here clear, 1. Wherein the Act of Juſtifying Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts. 2. Remove ſome miſtakes about it, and make ſome Uſe of it.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> we ſuppoſe there are theſe <hi>Four</hi> requiſit, in, or to Juſtifying Faith; though not alwayes in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. 1. That there be diſtinct Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in ſome meaſure of the Object; an antecedent that Faith preſuppoſes, and for which cauſe Faith gets the name of <hi>Knowledge</hi> here and elſewhere in Scripture; the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent being put for the conſequent; For Faith hath alwayes Knowledge with it, though Knowledge hath not alwayes Faith. 2. That there be an aſſent to the thing known; as when we know that we are Sinners, and that it is the Blood of Chriſt that muſt cleanſe us from Sin, we muſt aſſent to the truth of theſe, as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>John</hi> 8. <hi>If ye believe not Moſes his writings, how ſhall ye believe my Words?</hi> If ye aſſent not to the truth of that he hath written, how can ye believe my ſpeaking? both theſe are in the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and if there be no more, this makes but Hiſtorical Faith. 3. When the Soul knows it's a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and under the Curſe, and that Chriſt is a Saviour, and that there is Salvation to be gotten by ſuch a Mean, and that he an able Saviour, and hath <hi>aſſented</hi> to the truth of theſe; there is a <hi>conſenting</hi> of the heart to that Truth conditionally propoſed, and made offer of, that is to receive Chriſt as he is offered in the Goſpel; which in Scripture is called <hi>a receiving</hi> of Him, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>To as many as received him,</hi> &amp;c. And this is an Act of the <hi>Will;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Chriſt as offered, and a bargain propoſed that will make the Soul happy where Faith accepts. 4. There is a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Chriſt received as a good bargain; which is alſo an Act of the heart, or will, called in Scripture a <hi>committing our ſelves to him, a leaning on him,</hi> or <hi>rolling our ſelves on him;</hi> which we conceive to be the ſame that <hi>Paul</hi> hath, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.9. <hi>That I may be found in him;</hi> When the Soul places it's ſafety here, and lippens to Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe alone, as contradiſtinguiſhed to it's own; Theſe <hi>Two</hi> laſt Acts are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the eſſence of Faith as Juſtifying; and they are well holden out in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, where Faith is deſcribed to be <hi>a ſaving grace whereby we receive and reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ as he is offered in the Goſpel;</hi> we ſhall illuſtrat it in a compariſon made uſe of before to this purpoſe; Suppoſe there were a number of Rebells, that had incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Princes diſpleaſure, and were guilty of Treaſon by the Law, ſuppoſe alſo the Princes Son, or ſome Courtier hath ſatisfied for them, and procured their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Peace, upon which there comes out a Proclamation, that if they will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and yeeld themſelves, and lay down their Arms, they ſhall be pardoned, and admitted to friendſhip, as if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Rebelled; Theſe Rebels muſt know. 1. That there is an Act of Favour paſt, and a Proclamation made on ſuch Terms. 2. They muſt have a general Faith, and Aſſent to the thing, and that there is no Queſtion but ſuch a thing is done. 3. There is a conſultation by the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the will, if they will admit of, and receive it, and truſt themſelves to it. And then, 4. There is the hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to accept of the offer of Grace, on the Terms of the Proclamation, and a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it, which is a lippening of their Defence to it, that if ever they ſhould be called to an accompt, they will make uſe of ſuch an Act of Grace, and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation for their Defence, and ſafety, and lippen to it, and to His Faithfulneſſe who made the Proclamation, believing that He will fulfil His Word, and Promiſe: It is juſt ſo here, in a Sinners acting Faith for Juſtification; We may inſtance and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrat it alſo in the example of the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, wherein we may find ſomething of all this; when he had been in the hight of his diſtraction and madneſs, in his natural

            <p>More particularly; 1. Knowledge of the Object reſted upon is neceſſary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>How can they believe on him of whom they have not heard?</hi> It is not poſſible we can believe what we know not: And as every other ſtep hath ſome doctrinal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and ſome practical, ſo hath this; The Doctrinal miſtake is that Error of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> unworthy to be refuted; They ſay there is no Knowledge requiſit to Faith; Yea, ſome of their prime men have ſaid, that Faith is rather Ignorance then Knowledge; but ſurely then Faith would not be called <hi>Knowledge,</hi> if it might rather be defined Ignorance; but this they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to keep the People in Ignorance of the Goſpel, and it's the ground of many moe Errors, and much Deluſion; It's even as a blind man could go well in a ſlippery place where are many Pits, for Knowledge is no leſſe neceſſary to Faith, then eyes are to ſuch a man: The practical Errors in this, are ſuch as we find in many of you, who think ye can believe well, but aſk, and put you to it ye cannot tell what; many of you are obſtinat maintainers of implicit Faith, while ye ſay ye have Faith, and yet cannot tell what it is, nor whereon it is grounded; but we ſay that Knowledge is ſo neceſſary to Faith, that if it be not a part of it, yet it's neceſſarly antecedanious to it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed; Therefore, if ever ye would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Believers, ſtudy Knowledge, and the Knowledge of Chriſt Crucified, at leaſt ſo far as to ground your Faith upon; It's ſad that ſo many will maintain the reality of their Faith, and yet are groſly Ignorant of the Fundamenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>Aſſent</hi> requiſit to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Known, which is that we call <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical faith,</hi> and this is to be confirmed in the general Truths contained in the Goſpel; as that <hi>Adam</hi> was made according to Gods Image, that he fell, and brake the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, and made himſelf, and all his lyable to Gods Curſe; That we are by that Covenant under Gods Curſe, That Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God according to the Covenant of Redemption entered Himſelf Cautioner for the Elect, that He really died, and payed their Debt, That His pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe is made offer of in the Goſpel, and that according to the Covenant of Grace, there is an real abſolution from Sin, and an eternal happineſſe to be had at the great Day, through embracing of Him; There muſt be an aſſent to the Truth of theſe things, for it is impoſſible, that they who think not themſelves Sinners, and that mind not a Day of Judgement, and a reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, will ever cloſe with Chriſt, and lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to His Righteouſneſſe; I fear there are but few hearers of the Goſpel that come the length of Devils in believing; and yet all will needs be counted Chriſtians: we would here upon the one hand diſclaim the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Error, that pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="476" facs="tcp:152256:241"/> vain Faith of many Profeſſors, who, ſome way believe all that's in the Bible, ſo as they queſtion nothing herein; They know no other Faith but this; yet if this were Juſtifying Faith the Devil ſhould have it, <hi>For they believe and tremble,</hi> They believe there is a God, that Chriſt is the Son of God, that they that believe ſhall not periſh that God is Faithful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this Hiſtorical Faith is not enough. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as I juſt now ſaid) it may be in Reprobats, and Devils. 2. Becauſe the Scripture expreſly differenceth this ſort of Faith, from ſaving Faith, many were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Believers, to whom Chriſt would not commit himſelf, as it is, <hi>John</hi> 2.24. For, though they believed it to be truth which He ſpake, yet they reſted not on Him; So in the Parable of the Sower, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. There are three grounds that receive the Seed, which imports in two of them, at leaſt a kind of Believing, but the fourth ground is only good. 3. Becauſe this Faith Acts upon every revealed Truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and aſſents to all Paſſages recorded in the Bible alike; as one, and to that, <hi>Paul left his cloak at Troas,</hi> and the like; as it Acts on that, <hi>this is a faithful ſaying, that Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> and ſuch like; But according to the ground formerly given, Faith as it Juſtifies Acts on Chriſt only; and therefore this bare aſſent to the Truth of the Word, cannot be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith; becauſe it Acts no otherways on Chriſt, then it doth upon other things; ye would therefore know a difference in your practice betwixt theſe two, The cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting the truth of a thing, and your actual receiving, and reſting upon that Truth; As for Example, a man propoſeth Marriage to a woman, and ſhe believes that he is in earneſt, and not in ſcorn, yet there is a great difference betwixt that, and her actual conſenting to marrie him; So it is here, the man may believe that Chriſt doth really make offer of Himſelf to him, and yet be far from cordial receiving of Him; or take it in the example made uſe of before, ſuppoſe that ſome of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells we ſpoke of, believe the Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be a Truth; yet thinking it hard to be under the bands of Government they do not embrace it. If it be <hi>Objected</hi> here; That the Scripture often calls Juſtifying Faith a believing, <hi>that Christ is the Son of God,</hi> which is no more then this aſſent of the Judgement, or Hiſtorical Faith; For <hi>Anſwer,</hi> it would be conſidered of whom the Scripture there ſpeaks. 1. It is of <hi>Jews</hi> for the moſt part, who had the Faith of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> generally among them; and no queſtion, the Believers of them, ſuch as the proſelyted <hi>Eunuch, Martha,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> had the Faith of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ſatisfying Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, and of their Juſtification through His Satisfaction; But the great queſtion of the <hi>Jews</hi> was whether Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> was the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> or not, and it being revealed, and believed that he was, the other followed, they reſted on Him of will, (to ſay ſo) as the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of Chriſt to be the Son of God, doth not exclude, but include their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the receiving of Chriſt, but it holds forth alſo their aſſent to, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of that Truth that was then debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that He was indeed the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the Son of God; For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils confeſſed Him to be the Son of God, and none will ſay, but there was more in their believing Him to be the Son of God, then in the Devils believing it, who never believe unto Salvation as they did. 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that as ſometimes Knowledge is put for Faith, ſo this aſſent may be put for Faith, where yet more is implyed in it, eſpecially conſidering that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. Faith is called, Faith of the heart, <hi>with the heart man believeth;</hi> Now believing with the heart being an Act of the will, theſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies ſetting out Faith to be a believing Chriſt to be the Son of God; muſt imply a lippening to Him following upon it, we are therefore never to look on theſe places as comprehending a bare aſſent only, but as including alſo, and carrying alongſt with it, the cordial receiving Him, and of reſting upon Him.</p>
            <p>For the 3. to wit, the <hi>receiving Act</hi> of Faith, which differs from the former, as we ſhew in the examples hinted at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; It looks to the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:152256:241"/> betwixt Jehovah and the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; it accepts of the Terms of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as they are propoſed in the Goſpel and conſents to the bargain; and as God, propoſes the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, it ſubmits to the ſame; which <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. calls a <hi>ſaying worthy of all acceptation,</hi> to be welcomed, and believed as ſuch; and the Believers mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. are ſaid, <hi>not to have received the promiſes, but to have ſeen them afar off, and to have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,</hi> (or ſaluted) <hi>them:</hi> This receiving is no Phyſical, or Natural Act, as if we were to receive ſuch a thing by the mouth, or bodily hand, It's an Act of Faith in the heart, proportioned, and ſuited to this Spiritual Bargain, or Marriage propoſed in the Covenant of Grace; and it's like a mans conſenting to a civil bargain, or like a womans conſenting to marry a man; As when it is ſaid to Sinners ye are naturally dead in Sins and treſpaſſes, and under Gods Curſe; But, be it known to you, that we preach Remiſſion of Sins to you through the Blood of Chriſt; Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders this offer, accepts of and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes it.</p>
            <p>The 4th, and laſt Act, is <hi>a reſting on him;</hi> which is ſtill the ſame Faith, but another Act of it; Not as if there might be a receiving, and not a reſting, or a reſting, and not a receiving; or as if we were to difference them in reſpect of time; but Faith is ſaid to receive, as it reſpects the Goſpel offer, of Chriſt, and his Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and it's ſaid to reſt or rely, as it reſpects Chriſt and his Satisfaction, the thing offered and received, with regard to the charge to which it is lyable; It's here that it reſts, and to this it betakes it ſelf, as to it's defence, when challenged: It's difficult to difference theſe two, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorly to ſay whether Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be received, or reſted upon; yet it's made our defence, becauſe it's cloſed with, and we make them two Acts of the ſame Faith, though it's hard to make the one of them to be the effect of the other, or the one of them to be antecedent to the other, in reſpect of time at leaſt; As a Proclamation of Pardon being made to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, they ſay this Proclamation gives a freedom from the Laws purſuit, becauſe they have embraced it, and theſe Rebells make that the ground, if ever they be chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, whereon they found their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; they have this to lippen to, and upon this they reſt: Though none of theſe Acts can well be ſaid to be before, or after the other in reſpect of time: For clearing of this a little more, conſider that this reſting may be looked on, either <hi>Paſſively,</hi> or <hi>Actively; Paſſively,</hi> in reſpect of the Believers acquieſcing in Chriſt, and aſſuring himſelf that all ſhallbe well; This is not that Act of Faith that is called for to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; but ſuppoſes the Perſon to be Juſtified, for he muſt be Juſtified ere he can reſt, or acquieſce in it; <hi>Actively,</hi> in reſpect of our reſting on him that we may be Juſtified, as the Apoſtle hath it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. And this <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5.6. Is called a <hi>tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of Gods covenant;</hi> It is an actual committing of our ſelves to Him, that we may win to peace, or a leaning on Him; as ſuppoſe one were to reſt upon a Staff, it doth not only imply the effect, his having of eaſe, but alſo, and firſtly, his leaning to or reſting on it, in order to eaſe; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's ſaid, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy loaden, and ye ſhall find reſt:</hi> The Act that Juſtifies, is this laſt and active Act, the Act of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or leaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or reſting; and the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Act of acquieſcing, or aſſurance is that which follows upon it, as a fruit and effect of it: And therefore we humbly conceive, that it is not ſafe, to define Juſtifying Faith by <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> or to ſay that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Faith is, there is Aſſurance; It is rather a reſting on Chriſt, that we may have reſt; and a ground of Defence, and reaſon to be propoſed, if we ſhould be quarrelled for, or charged with the Debt of Sin.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> are, 1. To remove the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; as namely, it may be aſked here, is there no confidence not aſſurance in this Active Act of Faith which is the Eſſence of it? we anſwer ſhortly, There are <hi>Three</hi> ſorts of confidence pleaded for, that are far from the nature of Faith; and yet Faith
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:152256:242"/> wants not it's own Confidence, and Aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, if it be taken in a right ſenſe, The 1. is for a man to believe, that Chriſt died for him in particular, at the firſt hand, and to think that he hath no more to do, but to believe that Chriſt Died, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for him, and that thereupon he is Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; For this layeth a ground for univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Redemption againſt the current of the Scriptures, and can never be a ground of intereſt in Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe; It ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that to be done already, and admits not the Soul, to concur by believing for coming to the application; and yet this is very riſe amongſt People, I believe that Chriſt died for me, and ſhed His precious Blood for me, and ſo long as they can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this preſumption, and not ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to admit of any debating, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning whether they have ground and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, or not, they think they have Faith enough; but this is no Act of Faith, nor of the nature of true Juſtifying Faith, which is to take hold of Chriſt offered, that we may come to be abſolved through Him; Therefore, when ever the Scripture puts us to believe, It commands us to take hold of Chriſt offered, and not at firſt hand to believe, that he died for us in particular; I ſuppoſe many are carried away with this preſumption, that will to their coſt, at laſt find it to be otherwayes. 2. Others think that all Faith conſiſts in this; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God loved them from all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that they are already Juſtified, which is the <hi>Antinomian</hi> way; They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not that <hi>they may be juſtified,</hi> which was <hi>Pauls</hi> way, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they <hi>are</hi> Juſtified; And this alſo preſuppons an univerſal Redemption, and to preſſe it upon you, were to bid you all believe that God hath loved you, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned you from all Eternity; which were to bid you believe a lie; for we wot well from the Scriptures of Truth, that God hath not loved all from Eternity; and yet this is the Faith that many of you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly practiſes; we are all naturally ſome way <hi>Antinomians, Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> in our practice; and the way of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is more conſiſtent, and current with our nature, then the way of Truth: But, O! preſumptuous hypocrites, will ye dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly and without any ground believe Gods Love to you? God ſhall ſhake you out of that confidence, and blow upon it, and make it evaniſh; ye cry out on them that live in Error; yet ye practiſe theſe ſame Errors (to ſpeak ſo) as faſt as ye can; we cannot by much Preaching, get you brought to the Knowledge of the Truth, but ye can drink in Error ere ye hear of it, and it will ruin your Souls, if Grace prevent not; and many of you ſhall find that thus you have deſtroyed your ſelves. A 3d. Sort of rotten confidence, is that which ſome have, who cannot ſay they are for the time Juſtified, yet they have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion to get Heaven, and to be Juſtified ere they die, or that at death they will be ſure of it; and they wote well they ſhall not deſpair; This is alſo naughty preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and continued in, as hazardous as outer diſperation, and killeth moe Souls then diſpair doth; for ſuch reſt quietly in their hope of being fred from wrath, and having their peace made with God, and yet never go to Chriſt to have it done; this is like that mans preſumption, that ſayes, tuſh, <hi>I ſhall have peace though I walk in the imagination of my own heart;</hi> God is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and merciful, and I hope he will not be ſo ſevere as He is called; The Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth this a believing of Him, for He ſayes in His Word, that there is no peace to the wicked, and the fooliſh preſumer ſayes, I ſhall have peace; ſhall His Word or theirs ſtand? they ſay, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.12. and 7, 9. <hi>The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are theſe,</hi> they make a fair ſhew of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on ordinances, and yet <hi>ſteall, murder, and commit adultery, and ſay we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to do all theſe things;</hi> is not this a groſs believing of the Lord? God ſhall beat back many of your vain confidences in your faces, and your hearts ſhall tremble, and your faces wax pale, when God ſhall cauſe your Charge, and Summonds to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Judgement, ſound in your Ears; Theſe and ſuch like confidences will never bear you through; it is not theſe we ſpeak of.</p>
            <p>Yet 2ly. We ſay that the right exerciſe
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:152256:242" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Faith wants not it's own confidence, comfort, and aſſurance, when taken in a right ſenſe, much whereof is attributed by by ſome to the definition of Faith, for ſome miſtake Faith, and others are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; or miſunderſtood in their ſpeaking, of Faith; Some Divines that writ of Faith, ſpeak of it's being an aſſurance; defining it at it's hight; yet generally they take in, and preſuppoſe the active Act of Faith reſting on Chriſt, others define it by theſe two Acts, a receiving of, and reſting upon Chriſt; Therefore we would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of them, at leaſt of many of them, as making this aſſurance to our ſenſe to be eſſential, and abſolutely neceſſary to the being of Juſtifying Faith; much leſſe would we think, that they miſtaken, and paſſe by the true Acts of receiving and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Chriſt; only ſome of them (which we humbly think is their miſtake) having to do with <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who place Faith in the underſtanding, adde an aſſurance of Faith to the Former Acts; In which we ſay there is a ground of confidence, or a conditional aſſurance upon ſuppoſition, that Souls receive Chriſt, and reſt upon Him, they may be confident, that, that is a ground that will not fail them, They may be confident that He will not deceive them; a confidence in this, that they may ſtep to, or lean upon Chriſt, and not fear that He fail them; or that they may without all fear of hazard caſt themſelves on Chriſt; Therefore He is called <hi>a tryed elect, precious corner-ſtone, a ſure foundation;</hi> and indeed that is no ſmall ground of confidence, That when a Soul comes to Chriſt by believing, it may be ſure He will not fail it. 2. Being ſure that we have committed our ſelves to Chriſt (which ſuppoſes Faith's being put to exerciſe and practice) there may be a confidence in this reſpect, we may be ſure He will not fail us in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know in whom I have believed, and that he is able to keep that I have committed to him, and that I ſhall not be aſhamed;</hi> He puts both theſe together, I know that He is able, and that He will not fail me, I ſhall not be aſhamed; So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that neither death nor life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall be able to ſeparat us from the love of God that is in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> If Souls have received the offer, they may be ſure it will not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them. 3. Adde, that this actual, or active reſting on Chriſt may be ſeperat from the ſenſe of it, or from the paſſive Act of Faith, or quietneſſe that follows on reſting on Chriſt; for there is a reſting on Chriſt, which is very Faith it ſelf, and not the effect; <hi>come and ye ſhall find reſt;</hi> coming is before finding of reſt, to our ſenſe at leaſt, we are not to knit this paſſive reſt, with the other active Act of reſting, as if it were impoſſible to reſt on Chriſt without preſent ſenſible eaſe; Beſide it is this active reſting that gives us right to Chriſt, and not the paſſive, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>We believe that we may be justified;</hi> This neceſſarily goes before our believing that we are Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>To cloſe with a Word of more particular <hi>Uſe,</hi> let me exhort you to lay leſſe weight on your bare thinking that ye believe; on your preſent ill grounded hope and peace; Aim, and endeavour to Act, and exerciſe Faith on Chriſt actively, receiving and reſting on Him for winning to Peace; This practice of Faith is the over word (to ſay ſo) of the Doctrine of Juſt fication; That ſeing there is ſuch ground of Juſtification laid down, the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and that it is propoſed to you; and ſeing this is the very Act of Juſtifying Faith, to receive and reſt on Chriſt, as He is propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and offered; when this offer is made to you, let your Faith receive, take hold of and conſent to the bargain; and ground and found your Defence here, for anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all challenges that the Law and Juſtice may preſent againſt you; That there was a Saviour offered to you; and that ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Him, and reſted upon Him, will be a ground that ſhall bear you out when ye come before God; and except this be made ſure, our ſpeaking and your hearing of Faith will be to no purpoſe.</p>

We ſpoke alſo to the Object of this Faith, Chriſt Jeſus as our Righteouſneſſe, and Peace; So that Chriſt becomes in a peculiar manner the Object of Faith, beſide any other thing; Becauſe it's only in Chriſt, it can find a ſhelter; Therefore it's only to Chriſt that it fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Making them diſtinct benefits: To clear it a little further, <hi>Two</hi> things are to be conſidered in Sin, both which are to be removed by Chriſt, but differently: 1. Something that defils and polluts us, and makes at diſconform to Gods Image, hence Sin is in the Scripture compared to Boills and Sores, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous Cloaths, and is called <hi>filthineſs.</hi> 2. There is a guiltineſſe that follows on this, whereby we are not only preſuppoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, but are made lyable to the Laws Certification, wherein it's ſaid, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in every thing written in the book of the law to do it;</hi> Now if we ſpeak of the removing of theſe two, Juſtification takes away the guilt of Sin, when the Sinner is purſued before God's Tribunal, he is diſcharged by the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, to which he is fled for refuge; The Law abſolves him not becauſe he wants Sin, but becauſe the Mediator hath ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>isfied for his Sin; and that Satisfaction is by Faith laid hold of; Sanctification takes away the pollution, and blot of Sin, the Perſon that had theſe Boills and Sores is cleanſed, or healled, or is a healling, and under cure, (for there is no compleat healling while on this ſide of Heaven) As ſuppone a man by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the Law, had wounded himſelf, in wounding or hurting another, there is here both a guilt, and a deformity, a guilt in tranſgreſſing the Law, by hurting his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and a deformity in wounding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Juſtification is as if the penalty of the breach of ſuch a Law were not exacted, by the interpoſing of a Cautioner; and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is like the healling of the Wound in a mans ſelf, by taking or application of ſome Phyſick, or Plaiſter; So is it here, Juſtification ſets us free from the guilt, and Sanctification cures us of the wound of Sin; mans fall was a guilt, and by that fall he wounded himſelf; and by Chriſt bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>putation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe to us; the confounding of theſe two does ill, and is very prejudicial, not only to <hi>Papists,</hi> but to others, who think they are Juſtified, when they think they have ſome good frame, which being wanting, they ſuſpect their Juſtificat on. 2. The meaning is not as if Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe were our Sanctification, which is the Error of the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who make all Sanctification to be Juſtification, even as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> make all Juſtification to be Sanctification; therefore we would learn to diſtinguiſh theſe two, yet not ſo as to ſeparat them.</p>

<pb n="482" facs="tcp:152256:244"/> God ſerve to the Juſtifying of a Sinner, and the abſolving of him from the guilt of Sin; That is, when a Sinner ſenſible of Sin, is brought to lay hold on Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then follows Gods abſolving of him, as if he had never had Sin; or had ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his own Sin; which is not only holden out here, but is frequently ſpoken of through the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> and is the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſtands in oppoſition to the way of Works; to wit, when a poor Sinner ſenſible of Sin, is perſwaded by Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to flee unto, and reſt upon Chriſts Righteouſneſſe offered in the Goſpel, upon which follows Gods abſolving of him; This <hi>Doctrine</hi> takes in the ſubſtance of the Text, <hi>By the knowledge of my righteous ſervant ſhall many be juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſeveral things that will fall to be cleared in the proſecuting of this, which we ſhall ſpeak to ſhortly, for clearing of that Queſtion of the Catechiſm, what is Juſtification? becauſe this <hi>Doctrine</hi> holds out the <hi>Form</hi> of it, and deduceth it in this order. 1. A Sinner is here ſuppoſed to be lying under Gods curſe, according to that, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continues not in all things written in the law,</hi> This is mans condition by nature. 2. It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that Chriſt becomes Cautioner for elect Sinners, and takes on their Debt, and ſatisfies for them; on condition that if they ſhall believe on Him, they ſhall be Juſtified, and have His ſatisfaction imputed to them, and that the Lord Jehovah ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Mediators Satisfaction, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth to make out the condition.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Lord, in the Word of the Goſpel hath revealed this; and hath comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the way of a Sinners Juſtification in the Goſpel Covenant, and promiſes, and makes offer of it to all that hear of it, ſaying, <hi>He that believes in the Son ſhall not periſh, but have eternal life, and all that believe on him ſhall be juſtified from all things, whereby they could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes:</hi> This is the external inſtrumental cauſe of Juſtification, that holds out the way to Life; which ſuppoſes the former. 4. When this is made offer of in the Goſpel, there is the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eration of Gods Spirit on the Soul illight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Mind of the Sinner, convincing him of his hazard, chaſing him to Chriſt, and powerfully perſwading him to take hold of His Righteouſneſſe made offer of to him; whereupon the Soul comes to put forth the Act of Faith, and to reſt upon His Righteouſneſſe; as when it was ſaid by <hi>Philip</hi> to the <hi>Eunuch, Act.</hi> 8. <hi>If thou believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou mayeſt juſtified;</hi> The Soul anſwers, <hi>I believe in Christ the Son of God;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it becomes a bargain; and this is the inward mean, or inſtrumental cauſe of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. 5. Follows Gods imputing to that Sinner, that receives Chriſt as He is offered, and reſts upon Him by Faith, His Righteouſneſſe, and Chriſts payment and ſatisf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction to Juſtice is counted his, and according to this, his Sins are pardoned, for the merit of that Righteouſneſs, and he himſelf is accepted &amp; accounted Righteous, as if he had never ſinned; and he hath ſuch a ſentence paſt on him, as is held forth in theſe words of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered, to whom the Lord imputs to iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and in theſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now no condemnation to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> Even as before he fled to Chriſt, there was a Curſe ſtanding againſt him: And this is an Act of God, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign and efficient Cauſe, <hi>To declare his righteouſneſs, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that believes in Jeſus,</hi> as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. which is the final cauſe.</p>
            <p>We may confirm this either as to the poſitive part, that by believing a Sinner is Juſtified, or as to the negative part, that there is no other way poſſible whereby a Sinner can be Juſtified, but by believing; So that this great Effect follows from a ſenſible Sinners taking hold of Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by Faith: Ye may look upon a few Scriptures to this purpoſe, as namely, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. Where the Apoſtle entering in the debate layes down this concluſion, <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, even we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt;</hi> as if he had ſaid, we have taken this way for the attaining of this end, <hi>believing that we
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:152256:244"/> might be juſtified;</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks here, 1. Of a Juſtification by Faith, which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit to Works, and as he aſcribes it to Faith, ſo he denyes it to Works. 2. He makes it excluſive, and will have no other thing to concur in the manner at leaſt, but Faith; <hi>Knowing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that a man is not juſtified by works, but by faith.</hi> 3. He holds out his own, and other Believers practice; <hi>Even we have believed, that we might be juſtified;</hi> As if he ſaid, we took this way of Faith to be abſolved before God, which by the Law, or the Works of the Law, would never have been; See al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to this purpoſe the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. and 5. <hi>Chapters,</hi> eſpecially the 3, and 4. In the 3d. <hi>chap. v.</hi> 25. When he is ſumming the Doctrine of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into a compend, he ſayes, <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith, to declare his righteouſneſſe for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins,</hi> &amp;c. Where Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is called a <hi>Propitiation through faith,</hi> and Faith is holden out as the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel in which Juſtification runs; and in the words following the Believer is holden out as the Object of it; So <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. It's holden out in the inſtance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> particularly <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteouſneſſe;</hi> Where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle propones <hi>Two</hi> wayes of a perſons aiming to be Juſtified; The 1. whereof is, when a man works, or worketh not on that account to be Juſtified by them, and on that account ſeeks to be Juſtified, and that way is rejected. The 2. is, when a man hath no works, but by Faith betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Chriſt's Satisfaction; and that way is eſtabliſhed, for that mans Faith is count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Righteouſneſſe, and is the ground of his peace before God; we gave ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures before for this, and ſhall not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now inſiſt. There is alſo good reaſon, why it cannot be otherwayes, 1. If we conſider what man is in himſelf, ungodly, rebellious, having nothing to preſent unto God; but when a Righteouſneſſe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him by way of offer, and he is through Grace brought to accept of the offer of Righteouſneſſe of another, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be conceived to be brought to receive it but his Faith; and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Chriſts Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction be his Juſtification, and if it be Faith that takes hold of it, we have a clear reaſon why Juſtification is attributed as to Faith. 2. Conſider, That this contributs moſt to Gods end, which is to glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, eſpecially in his Grace, in the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Sinners, even to hold forth the manifold riches of His Grace; and nothing contributs to this ſo much, and ſo well, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that which ſpeaks the Sinner to be empty; and nothing empties the Sinner more then Faith; it being the great Act of Faith to bring the Soul of it's own bottom, and to ſtop all boaſting; to drive it out of it ſelf to be found in Him; Therefore, <hi>it's ſaid to be of faith, that it might be of grace, Rom.</hi> 14.16. As if he had ſaid, if it were by any other thing, it could not be by Grace, but Faith claims nothing but the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt to reſt on; He hath payed the price, and made the Satisfaction, and that Satisfaction is mine, ſaith Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was offered to me, and I have been brought to lay hold on it; and the nature of this pleading ſtops the mouth of the creature, and proclaims Juſtification to be alone the effect of Gods Grace, and of Chriſts procurement. 3. Conſider, That if it depended on any other thing, our Juſtification could never be perfit; when we ſpeak of Juſtification, and call it perfite; It is not ſo to be underſtood, as if Faith were perfite, but Chriſts Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is our Righteouſneſſe, and which Faith layes hold on is perfite, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hough our Faiths grip be weak; Hence it is, that the weak Believer is Juſtified, as well as the ſtrong; all who look unto Chriſt, though with a weak ſighted eye, yet Salvation through him as well as <hi>Abraham;</hi> becauſe His Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is perfite, which weak Faith takes hold of as well as ſtrong Faith: Now if Juſtification were founded on ought within us, it could never be perfit, but <hi>by him all that believe are juſtified from all things from which they could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes:</hi> And one of them made at free as another; It's not here as if one part of the Debt were ſcored and blotted out, and

            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> are many and comfortable, 1. It ſerves for our Direction; if any were aſking; how they may come to be Juſtified? This Doctrine anſwers by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt; by taking with your Sin, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe offered to you in the Goſpel, and by making that your D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fence before God; And is not this a Leſſon worthy the learning? which the whole Word of God aims at, even to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you how to make your peace with Him; It's by the knowledge of Chriſt, or by Faith in Him, by reſting on Him, as He is offered in the Goſpel; and this cannot but be a ſolid and ſicker way of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe we have Gods Word for it, it's founded on His Faithfulneſſe, and on the Tranſaction made betwixt God and the Mediator; we have alſo the experience of all the Saints for it, <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, <hi>David</hi> under the Law, and <hi>Paul,</hi> ſince the Law; all of them were led the ſame way: ye would take no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ice of this, not only as the great queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Catechizing, or Examination, but as ground whereon ye build your peace, if ye were dying; There is a perfite Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in Chriſt made offer of to you in the Goſpel, on condition ye will receive Him as He is offered; and if ye ſo receive Him, it ſhall be yours, and ye ſhall at Gods Ear be abſolved; the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt ſhall be as effectual for your abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if it were inherent in your ſelves, and Faith ſhall unite you to Him, and make you one with Him: In a word, ye muſt all come before Gods Tribunal, and there are but two Defences to be propoſed; either ſomething in your ſelves, as your love and charity, or good carriage and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; or to take with your Sin, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn your ſelves, and to flee to Chriſt, and preſent His Righteouſeneſſe, as the Righteouſneſſe of the Cautioner that hath payed your Debt, and according as ye take the one way, or the other, ye may expect to be Juſtified or not; and this <hi>Doctrine</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the one way, and own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And therefore, 2. (which is the great <hi>Uſe</hi> of all this <hi>Doctrine</hi>) here there is ground laid down to any that would be Juſtified, how they may win to it, and a warrand to propoſe Juſtification, as a thing attainable through Faith in Him; ye have it in your offer on theſe terms, and therefore let me earneſtly intreat you to accept of the offer; if this be the way of Juſtification, take this way; ſeing there is an abſolute neceſſity of Faith in every one that ſhould be at Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, make it ſure that ye are indeed fled to Chriſt; and that it is His Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which ye make your Defence before the Bar of Gods Tribunal: We ſhall branch forth this <hi>Uſe</hi> of Exhortation in theſe <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> words. 1. When Chriſt is ſpoken of in the Goſpel, let him be by Faith received; and if ye would know what this is, labour 1. To know, and to take up the difference betwixt ſelf-Righteouſneſſe, and that Righteouſneſſe which is by Faith; For many are ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that they know neither the one nor the other, or at leaſt not the one by the other. 2. When ye are come to know the difference betwixt theſe two, and are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly weighing what ye would lippen to, in your coming before God; with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhuffle out, and caſt by, diſclaim, and renunce your own Righteouſneſſe, and grip to the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; here Faith will have a double Work, upon the one hand to reject Self-righteouſneſſe, and upon the other hand to reſt upon the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt alone; according to that, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.9. 3. When ye have
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:152256:245"/> gotten your own Righteouſneſſe caſten, and Chriſts Righteouſneſſe cloſed with, there is a neceſſity to cover and hide your ſelves in it, that ye may never ſo much as in the vaging conceit of your mind, be found out of it; It alluds to the City of refuge, wherein, when once entered into, and abiden in, the perſon was ſafe, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of blood; which held out not only the Act of Faith fleeing to Chriſt, but it's abiding in Him, being hide in Him, containing and keeping it ſelf in Him, and continuing to plead it's Defence on that ground; There may be in a fit of ſad exerciſe a renouncing of our own Righteouſneſſe, but when that is over, and we begin to conceit ſomething of that which we have done, we are ready to forget Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, and to lean to our own; and that it in a manner to come out of Chriſt, and from our City of Refuge, if ever we were in Him: Faith, as it betakes it ſelf to Chriſt, ſo it States it ſelf in Chriſt, where only it dare abide the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. 2. We would commend this to you, as the great ground of your Peace and Hope, even that ye would put it to the tryal, and make it ſure whether ye be in the Faith or not; It is true there are many beguiled in this, and take themſelves to be in the Faith when they are not; and others queſtion their Faith, and their being Juſtified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out juſt ground; yet it's impoſſible to win to clearneſſe of intereſt in Chriſt, or to the having of any ſolid and comfortable hope, of enjoying God, except there be ſome clearneſſe that we are in the Faith, and have indeed betaken our ſelves to Chriſt; which cannot be win at, without putting it to the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>THe Doctrine of Juſtification through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus was wont to be much thought of among the People of God, it is called, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>The preaching of the Goſpel to Abraham,</hi> when God fore-told him of a way of Juſtification, and Salvation through Chriſts coming of him, <hi>That in him all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed;</hi> This was the telling of Good news to him; and we are ſure it is as good news now as ever it was, and would be ſo to us, if we could look on it Spiritually as they did; For there is as great hazard in Sin, and the Curſe is as terrible and inſufferable, and the love of God as freſh now as they were then.</p>
            <p>We have for ſome dayes been ſpeaking of this Doctrine of Juſtification, and it will be much to ſpeak and hear of it profitably, we deſire not to inſiſt of what may be unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but we conceive there is ſome neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in inſiſting in this; It's our own negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and ignorance that makes many things of this kind to be very unuſeful, evenſo that we ſcarcely conceive them; and we are made heartleſs in ſpeaking of them, becauſe to many they are, as if ſpoken in a ſtrange language, which is, and ſhould be for a lamentation.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing we propoſed, was to hold forth the mean by which Juſtification is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, to wit, <hi>Faith;</hi> which we obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſhew how Faith concurres in the attaining of Juſtification: Few or none ever denyed Faith to be neceſſary for the attaining of Juſtification, neither can any that read the Word of God with the leaſt conſideration, but have that impreſſion of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the great thing wherein the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence lyes, and wherein men miſcarry, is, in attributing to Faith the right or wrong manner of it's concurrence in the attaining of this effect; Though theſe things may at firſt bluſh, look like meerly notional ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, and ſuch as do not concern Chriſtians practice; yet there is no error in Doctrine about this matter, but there is ſomething in folks practice that looks like it, and is influenced by it; And it's mens inclination to error in practice, that makes them as it were to coyn errors in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>We ſhall <hi>Obſerve</hi> two generals further, and proceed, The 1. whereof is, That Faith hath a peculiar way of concurrence for the attaining of Juſtification, which can agree to no other Grace, nor Work, nay nor to Faith it ſelf, conſidered as a Work; Therefore <hi>Justification of many</hi> is here deryved to them <hi>by his knowledge,</hi> or by Faith in Him; that is by Faith in Chriſt, as ſecluding all other things; It's by Faith that Juſtification is deryved and applyed to us, and by Faith we come to have right to it, and an Intereſt in it.</p>
            <p>The 2d. is, That however Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for attaining of Juſtification; yet it's not Faith of it ſelf, or by any vertue or effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in it ſelf; but as taking hold of Chriſt as the Object of it, that it juſtifies, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's ſaid to be <hi>by the knowledge of him,</hi> or by Faith in Him, it's by receiving Him, uniting us to Him, and reſting on Him that we are Juſtified.</p>
            <p>We ſhall ſhortly explicat both theſe branches, and then come to ſome practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal uſe of them together.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="487" facs="tcp:152256:246"/>1. Then, we ſay that there is ſomething in Juſtification attributed to Faith, that cannot agree to any other thing; which is implyed in many Scriptural Phraſes, and in this <hi>Text;</hi> in as far as it is ſaid, that <hi>by his knowledge,</hi> or by Faith in Him, Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is attained: And therefore when we are ſaid to be juſtified by Faith, we affirm that Faith hath a peculiar way of concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the attaining of Juſtification, which can agree to no other Grace, as to Repentance, Love, Meekneſſe, Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not to Prayer, Almeſdeed, or any other good Works or Work; For confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, conſider, 1. That we are ſaid to be Juſtified by Faith in oppoſition to Works, and that there is ſomething attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Faith, which is denyed to Works: Generally this is clear in theſe <hi>Epiſtles</hi> written to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians;</hi> Particularly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2, 3. <hi>If Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God, for what ſaith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs, now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt, but to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, his faith is commited to him for righteouſneſs;</hi> where moſt clearly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly, believing and working are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſit the one to the other; and, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>We who are Jews by nature, knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (or as the word is, no not but by Faith, that is, a man is not juſtified by Works, but by Faith) <hi>Even we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the law;</hi> Where the Apoſtle can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not more purpoſely and preſſingly make a difference betwixt any two things then he doth betwixt theſe two, Juſtification by Works, and Juſtification by Faith: And in all this diſcourſe, it cannot be ſaid, that the Apoſtle only excluds Works in reſpect of merit, or Works, as they look to the Works of the Ceremonial Law; For he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Faith, and all ſorts of Works, or Works in whatſoever reſpect, as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent; It's not one or two ſorts of Works; but all ſorts of Works of the Law; and there can be no Works but ſuch as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Law, which are excluded. Now if the Apoſtle ſeclude all theſe, what are the Works that we can be juſtified by? 2. Conſider the peculiar Phraſes, that the Scripture uſeth to this purpoſe, and where we are ſaid to be <hi>Juſtified by faith;</hi> There is a ſort of cauſality attributed to Faith, that can be attributed to no other Grace, nor Works; Hence the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is called the <hi>Righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> and we are ſaid to be <hi>Juſtified by faith in his blood.</hi> So <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>I count all things to be but dung that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having my own righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is of God b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how the Apoſtle oppoſeth the two Covenants, The Covenant of Works made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Covenant of Grace made with Believers in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7. <hi>Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the law, that the man which doth theſe things ſhall live by them;</hi> The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the Law ſpeaks of <hi>doing,</hi> by which we come to be Juſtified; <hi>But the righteouſneſſe of faith,</hi> or the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Speaketh on this wiſe, The word is near thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart, That if thou confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thy heart that God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> Where the Apoſtle oppoſeth theſe two Covenants, not in reſpect of merit only, as if the one were inconſiſtent with Grace, and not the other, but he oppoſeth them in this, that the Righteouſneſſe of the one Covenant is in <hi>doing,</hi> and the Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the other Covenant is by <hi>believing;</hi> And therefore, according to this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ever is a mans <hi>doing</hi> is not the ground of his Peace, and

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt of Works; and the Righteouſneſſe of the Covenant of Grace is quite of another nature; to wit, <hi>Believing in him who juſtifieth the ungodly.</hi> 4. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the thing that is the ground of our Juſtification before God, is Chriſt's Righteouſneſs inherent in Himſelf, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, for the covering of our naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; becauſe He is as our Cautioner hath payed our Debt; Hence it follows, that Faith hath another way of concurring in Juſtification then any other thing can have; becauſe it's Faith which receives and pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s on that Righteouſneſſe, which no other thing doth; <hi>That I may be found in him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.9. <hi>not having my own righteouſneſs, but the righteouſneſs which is by the faith of Chriſt;</hi> So that to be <hi>in him</hi> is to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve His Righteouſneſſe, and this Righteouſneſſe is put on by Faith: Only take two words of Adveriſement ere we come to clear the other branch of the Doctrine. The 1. is this, when we ſpeak of the peculiarneſs of the way of Faith's concurring in Juſtification, ſo as no other Grace or Work doth, we deſign not to weaken, or cry down the neceſſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and of other Graces, nor of good Works, the very thoughts whereof we abhore, but to give every one of them their own, and the right place; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's a groſs calumnie to ſay, that we affirm, that the ſtudy and practice of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and good Works is not neceſſary; we only cry them down on this account, that when we come before God, our Works, or Holineſſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e not to be preſented to Him as the ground of our Juſtification and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, but the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt that Faith takes hold of; and in this we ſay, that Faith peculiarly concurres as no other Grace doth, becauſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>'s fitted with an aptitude to receive and apply Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, which no other Grace is as we ſay, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The 2d. Branch is, that this peculiarneſs of Faiths concurring in Juſtification, is not from any efficacy in Faith or from Faith conſidered as our Deed or Work, but as it Acts on Chriſt, as the Obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct of it; and therefore when it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. That <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him for righteouſneſs;</hi> The meaning is not, as if God had accepted his believing, as an Act or Work for his Righteouſneſſe, and that it was accounted as a perfite Grace; but the meaning is, that Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the promiſed Seed received by Faith, or his betaking of himſelf to the Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hteouſneſs of Chriſt holden out to him in the Promiſe, was accounted his Righteouſneſſe; as if he had had an inherent Righteouſneſſe of his own; and ſo Faith is imputed not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of it's Act, but in reſpect of it's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; By his union with Chriſt through Faith, Chriſts Satisfaction becomes his: To clear it a little, take theſe conſider<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1. Conſider Faith as a Grace in us, and ſo it cannot be imputed for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for in that reſpect it's a Work, and is excluded by the Apoſtles oppoſition, made of Grace and Works; It muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be Faith conſidered as acting in it's Object. 2. Conſider that in Scripture, to be Juſtified <hi>by Chriſt, by his blood,</hi> and <hi>by Faith,</hi> are all one; becauſe when it is ſaid we are juſtified by Chriſt, or by His Blood, it takes in Chriſt and His Blood laid hold on by Faith, therefore ſometimes <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Faith,</hi> is called our Righteouſneſſe becauſe, as Chriſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as ſuffering, and ſatisfying is the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſe of our Juſtification, ſo Faith
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:152256:247"/> is the inſtrumental cauſe taking hold of His Satisfaction, which is our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; both are neceſſary in their own way, and Chriſts Righteouſneſſe implyes Faith, and Faith implyes Chriſt and His Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, the one implyes the other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily. 3. Conſider the Phraſes uſed in Scripture to this purpoſe as where we are ſaid <hi>to be justified by faith,</hi> it ever reſpects Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and where we are ſaid <hi>by faith to put on Christ,</hi> It is not Faith conſidered as Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of it ſelf, but it's Faith conſidered as Acting on Chriſt and His Righteouſneſs; Therefore it's the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith, the Righteouſneſſe which is in Chriſt, and by Faith, taken hold of by us, and becoming ours.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> are ſeveral, 1. For informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conviction, and we would, 1. be informed in, and underſtand well the meanining of this Doctrine, when we ſay that Faith is neceſſary to Juſtification, and concurreth in attaining of it as no other thing doth, that ye may give it it's right place, and may make no confuſion of theſe things that are diſtinct, 1. We deny not Works, notwithſtanding of all that we have ſaid, to be neceſſary, more then we do Faith; but the great difference is anent the giving of Faith and Works, or Faith as it is a work on equal ſhare in reſpect of cauſality in our Juſtification; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we would beware with <hi>Papiſts</hi> to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute a ſort of condignity to Faith, as if it merited eternal Life, which flowes from their ignorance of Gods Covenant; For they think, that ſince He commands us to believe, and promiſeth Life to believing, that there is a merit in believing; as they fancie, there is in Prayer, Almeſ-deeds, and others Duties, or good Works; but in this reſpect, as it is a Work in us, the Apoſtle excludes Faith, and makes our Juſtification free; whereas, if Faith in Juſtification were conſidered as a Work meriting our Juſtification, it ſhould not be free; and although there be no <hi>Papiſts</hi> in profeſſion here amongſt us, yet it may be there are ſome, and that not a few, that think God is obliged to them becauſe they believe, and that expect Heaven, and life Eternal on that ground, even as when they pray, they think they ſhould be heard for their Praying, and when they give Almes, that they ſhould be rewarded for the ſame, as a meritorious Work. 2. Neither do we underſtand, when we ſay that Faith is neceſſary to Juſtification, and concurreth in the attaining of it; That by believing we are diſpoſed to be holy, and ſo more enabled to Juſtifie our ſelves; which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Error, wherein I fear many profeſſors of the Goſpel amongſt us ly, who think they are obliged to their Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it diſpoſes them to hear, read, pray, and the like, and ſo enableth them to work out a Righteouſneſſe to themſelves, whereby they expect to be Juſtified; This is another fault, and Error to be guarded againſt; For though we give Faith a radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal vertue to keep Life in other Graces, yet ſo conſidered it is ſtill a piece of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Holineſs, and pertains to Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and not to Juſtification. 3. When we ſay that Faith concurres in the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Juſtification, we do not ſay that it concurres in the ſame manner, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Prayer, and good Works do concur: But it may be ſaid here, ſeing we grant that good Works and Duties are neceſſary, what then is the difference? I anſwer, in theſe two. 1. Faith is the proper and peculiar condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and not our Works, or Holineſs; whereof Faith conſidered as a Work is a part; Works is the condition of the Covenant of works, for it ſayes in this manner, <hi>The man that doth theſe things ſhall live by them,</hi> but the Covenant of Grace in oppoſition to it, ſayes, <hi>If thou believe with thy heart in the Lord Jeſus, and confeſs with thy mouth, that God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. What Works, is in the one Covenant, Faith is in the other Covenant, and that as it is oppoſed to Works, and to Faith it ſelf, as it is a Work in us. 2. There is a peculiarneſs in Faith's concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the attaining of Juſtification, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of it's inſtrumentalneſs in taking hold of Chriſt for our Juſtification, or in receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reſting upon Him (as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:152256:248"/> for that end; For when Chriſt is offered in the Goſpel; Faith flees to Him, receives Him, takes hold of Him, and reſts on Him; neither Repentance, nor Prayer, nor any good Work, hath an aptitud, and fitneſs to receive Chriſt and preſent His Satisfaction to God as the ground of the Sinners defence, as Faith hath; And therefore it's ſo often ſaid by Divines ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture, that Faith is the inſtrumental cauſe of our Juſtification; which we ſhall clear in two or three ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, which the Scripture makes uſe of, 1 Chriſt compares Himſelf to the brazen Serpent lifted up in the wilderneſſe, <hi>John</hi> 3.14. Man by Sin is ſtung deadly, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were by the fiery Serpents, Chriſt Jeſus as ſuffering, and hung, or lifted up upon the Croſs, is propoſed to our Faith to look upon, as the brazen Serpent was propoſed to them that were ſtung, and put up on a poll for that end; and as there was no healling to the ſtung <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they looked to it, and the cure follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to none but to theſe who did behold it; So Chriſt Jeſus propoſed as the Object, and meritorious Cauſe of Juſtification, Juſtifies none but ſuch as look to Him by Faith; and although they were to look to the Brazen Serpent, yet their look gave no efficacy to the cure, but it flowed from Gods ordaining that as a mean of their Cure; even ſo it is not from any efficacy in Faith conſidered in it ſelf, that Sinners are Juſtified, but it is from Jeſus Chriſt the Object, that Faith eyeing Him lifted up, as the Saviour of the elect, and His Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as appointed of God for that end, doth Juſtifie: and therefore it may well be called an inſtrumental cauſe, becauſe it is not Chriſt abſtractly conſidered, that Juſtifies, more then it was the Serpent conſidered abſtractly, without their look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, that did cure, but Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and laid hold on by Faith; and in this reſpect Faith is ſaid to Juſtifie, even as the e e looking to the Brazen Serpent put them in capacity of the Cure, though the Cure flowed from Gods appointment, and not from their looking; So is it in Faith's concurring for the attaining of Juſtification. A 2d. Similitude is that of miraculous Faith; We find it often ſaid by the Lord, in His working ſuch Cures, <hi>Thy faith hath made the whole;</hi> There was no efficacy in Faith it ſelf for producing the Cure, but it was the mean by which the Cure was tranſmitted to the Perſon under ſuch a diſeaſe; So it is in believing, in order to our Juſtification; It is by believing on Chriſt, that our Spiritual Cure in Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is tranſmitted to us, and we are ſaid to be Juſtified by Faith, as they were ſaid to be cured by Faith, becauſe, by Faith it is convoyed to us. A 3d. Similitude for clearing, that Faith may well be called the inſtrumental Cauſe of Juſtification, may be this, even as the Advocats pleading may be called the inſtrumental Cauſe of the Clients abſolving; As ſuppoſe a man whoſe Cautioner had payed his Debt, were cited to anſwer for the Debt, his Advocat pleads his abſolution, and freedom from the Debt, becauſe his Cautioner hath payed it; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Debt was payed, yet the man had not been abſolved, if it had not been ſo pleaded on this behalf; So the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Faith in the Sinners Juſtification, is to table Chriſt's Satisfaction for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence before God, and to plead his abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ground; The believing Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Faith ſayes it is true, I was own ſo much Debt of Sin, but Jeſus Chriſt my Cautioner to whom I am fled hath ſatisfied for it, therefore I ought to be abſolved; and the Law allowes of this ſort of plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and upon this ground; in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Faith concurreth in attaining, and may well be called the Inſtrumental Cauſe, of our Juſtification: I ſhall ſay no more on this <hi>Uſe,</hi> but theſe two words; we may partly regrat our great ignorance, that we know ſo little of the uſe of Faith in our Juſtification; And partly we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y lament the great confuſion that is in theſe times, wherein men are ſet to overturn ſuch a clear truth, as if Faith had no inſtrumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in our Juſtification, but as if it, and other Duties and Works were equal ſharers and alike in it: Which, 1. overturns the nature of Gods Covenant of Grace, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Works the condition of it; as if there were no difference betwixt the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:152256:248"/> of Works and of Grace. 2. It hath this miſerable ill attending it, that it ſhoulders out Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, and ſhuffles in an inherent Rrighteouſneſſe of our own, as our defence when we come immediatly before the Throne of God; whereas the Goſpel puts us to a Righteouſneſſe without us, and imputed to us: This way leads us to ſeek Righteouſneſſe in our ſelves; whether Works, or Faith, as a Work be made the ground of our Juſtification, it is all one: For if Faith conſidered as a Work in us diſpoſing us to Holineſs, and as a part of ſincere Holineſs, be the thing preſented to God, as the ground of our Juſtification, it is ſtill ſomething within us, and ſuch a thing, as is ſtill imperfite; which would miſerably mar poor Souls comfort; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt laid hold on by Faith, being made the ground of our Juſtification, it affoords ſolid conſolation; For though Faith in us be weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfite, yet His Righteouſneſſe is perfite; and as it was not the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> looking, as we ſaid, that was the ground of their health and cure; but Gods appointing of ſuch a mean for their cure looked to; Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes they that were weak-ſighted, and had bleared eyes might think themſelves not in ſuch capacity of healling, as theſe who were ſtrong and more clear-ſighted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they were all alike cured, if once they looked; even ſo is it here.</p>
            <p>A 2d, <hi>Uſe</hi> of this, and the other Doctrine formerly ſpoken of, is for Direction, and practical Information; would any know how to get Juſtification by Chriſt, here is the way; It's by Faith in Him; when Chriſt Jeſus and His Satisfaction is made offer of in the Goſpel, for Juſtifying all ſelf-condemning Sinners, that lay hold on Him; Sinners by Faith fleeing to Him, and reſting on Him, get a title to His Righteouſneſſe, that cannot but ſave them; So that if it were, 1. aſked, what is that which a man appearing before the Throne, dare hazard to preſent to God, as the ground of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? It's anſwered, Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, His Satisfaction. 2. If it were aſked, How comes one to have Title and Right to that Righteouſneſſe, ſo as he may, own and preſent it for his defence? It is anſwered, that it is attained by believing in Him; If it be aſked, how comes Faith to get a Title to that Righteouſneſſe, is it by any vertue, or efficacy in Faith, as a Work in us? It's anſwered, no, but it comes to get Title to it, by going out of it ſelf, by receiving, and taking hold, and making uſe of the worthineſſe that is in Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is as a Garment, able to cover the Sinners nakedneſſe, and to hide all his ſpots, and as a compleat Ranſom to pay all his Debt: And this we ſee here upon the one ſide, a neceſſity of Faith in order to Juſtification, and upon the other ſide, a warning, not to count Grace, and the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, the leſs free; that Faith hath an inſtrumentality in the application of it; Faith having <hi>Two</hi> things that it pleads upon. 1. Emptineſs, and need in it ſelf, whence it arrogats nothing to it's own pleading, but 2. founds it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence on the good ground it hath to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; And therefore, as upon the one hand, we would know that there is away to come by Juſtification, by taking hold of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe by Faith; So upon the other hand, we would be afraid to let any thing ſtick to us from our Faith, as if we had a meritorious, or efficient hand in, or were to be thanked for, our winning to Juſtification; For as a Beggar, in receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Alms, can alleadge no merit to be in his receiving, or calling for it, ſo no more does Faiths receiving, mar the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Juſtification, by any merit in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Seing Faith concurres inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally in the attaining of Juſtification, there is here clear ground to exhort you, by Faith to receive Chriſt; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you the exerciſe of believing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, without it ye cannot be Juſtified, and by it ye ſhall certainly be Juſtified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. Here, O! here is ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to poor Sinners, ſenſible of Sin, trembling at Gods Bar, as being obnoxious to the Curſe; that by receiving of Jeſus Chriſt, they may be abſolved from the Debt of Sin, and fred from the Curſe; Therefore, if there be any ſuch here, put forth your hands, and receive what is in
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:152256:249"/> your offer; open your Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s mouth wide, and let in Chriſt, and He will fill it; Faith having, as to our Spiritual Life, the ſame place, that the mouth hath to the body, as to the entertaining of the natural and bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life, it opens and receives what is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to keep in the Life of the Body; And were not this good news to poor Souls burdened with Sin, loathing themſelves, and their own Righteouſneſſe, ſeing it all to be but as filthy Rags, and crying out with the <hi>Jaylour, what ſhall we do to be ſaved? Paul</hi> would ſay to ſuch, and we ſay it in the Lords name; <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and you ſhall be justified and ſaved;</hi> for Juſtification is derived by Faith in Him to the Sinner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 5. This ſerves exceedingly to humble a Sinner; whether it be a Sinner aiming, and ſeeking to be Juſtified, or a Sinner that hath attained Juſtification; in ſo far as there is no ground of boaſting here; If ye be aiming to be Juſtified, it may humble you; for what can ye contribute to it? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enabled, ye can indeed receive what is offered, and that is all; neither can ye receive except ye be enabled, as is ſaid; It ſerves alſo to humble ſuch as are Juſtified; Have ye Righteouſneſſe? it's not your own, but Chriſt's; It's He only that did the turn; if it ſhould be ſaid, ye beli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ved, and may boaſt of that? I aſk, what did ye when ye believed? did ye any more but this? ye pleaded guilty, and did conſent to take Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, and the pardon of Sin through Him freely; and what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of boaſting, I pray is here? none at all; Thus, this Doctrine contributes both to make theſe who are ſeeking pardon, and theſe who have gotten pardon, humble; <hi>Where is boasting then?</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>it is excluded, by what law? by the law of works? no, but by the law of faith,</hi> as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.17. The believing Sinner does nothing, and hath done nothing towards the procuring of His own Juſtification, but gets all freely: We can never think, nor ſpeak aright of Juſtification, but it layes our vain humour, and ſtops the mouth from boaſting, while it ſaith, <hi>What haſt thou O! man, but what thou haſt received? and if thou hast received it, why doſt thou boaſt, as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> We ſhall cloſe and ſhut up the whole of this Doctrine by propoſing ſome few conſiderations, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions from it; 1. See here a neceſſity of being acquainted with the Truths of the Goſpel, and with this Truth in particular, concerning Juſtification, (whereof, alace, many are very ignorant) ſeing there are ſo many wayes to go wrong, and ſo many do go wrong about it, we had need to be the more clear in the right way; If there were more knowledge of this, and of other Truths, we might ſpeak and hear with more profite, and if ye did not pleaſe your ſelves with meer and airy notions, but ſought to be ſettled in what ye hear of other Truths, and of this in particular, it would contribute much to your peace, and rid you of many doubts and difficulties: A 2d. Conſideration is, That there is much need to walk in holy fear, in ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, and other Truths, there are ſo many wayes to err, and a wrong ſtep here is very dangerous; It were exceeding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to be more in the ſtudy of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is of the very marrow of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and is deſervedly accounted to be <hi>articulus ſtantis, aut cadentis eccleſiae;</hi> but ye would come to it in fear, being jealous of your own ignorance, and ſhallowneſſe of capacity rightly to take it up, eſpecially, when new queſtions are riſing, and ſtarted concerning it; And as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſtudied this way, and held it forth to others, as the way whereby they went to heaven, and whereby others muſt come to it; So we commend it to you to follow them. A 3d. Conſideration is, If Faith be ſo neceſſary to Juſtification, as without it ye cannot be Juſtified, is there not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ye ſhould ſtudy to be diſtinct, and clear that ye have Faith, and that ye are indeed Believers? This is one of the great Uſes of all this Doctrine; If there be no way but Faith, and if, in ſtudying this one way, many go wrong, then as ye would make your calling and election ſure, ſtudy to make this ſure, by puting your ſelves to the tryal, if ye be taking this way as the Apoſtle moſt pathetically exhorts,
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:152256:249"/> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves if ye be in the faith, prove your own ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. It's truly matter of wonder to think how ſo many men and women are ſo ſoon ſatisfied in the matter of their believing, which yet is ſo tickle, and difficult a buſineſſe; we would have none to be jumbled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded about it, who deſire to be ſerious in the thing; yet we would have all waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and put to diligence; many men have taken pains to be wrong in this matter of Juſtification, and how few of you have taken pains to go right in it? and how is it that many of you win ſo eaſily at it? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. calls it, <hi>a ſtumbling ſtone</hi> to many, and <hi>a rock of offence;</hi> Surely, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it be ſo, your coming at it by gueſs, and ignoranly is to be ſuſpected; And therefore on this conſideration ye would be awakened, to put your ſelves more ſeriouſly to the ſtudy of it; and to try your ſelves, if ye be come well to it, for it's the ſpecial, yea the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-ground of your peace before God; There are many of you, who in a manner, think it impoſſible to miſcarry in this; For ye know that there is no way to be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied but by Faith; and yet if many of you were put to it, ye know not the manner nor way how Faith Juſtifies, which ſhews that it is not ſo eaſie a matter as ye take it to be. A 4th Conſideration is this, That in ſpeaking of Juſtification, and Faith's peculiarneſſe, or peculiar way of concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in it, ye would beware of crying down Works, as to their uſefulneſs, or neceſſity; This was an error that ſoon entered in the Church; as ſoon as <hi>Paul</hi> cleared and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, ſome aroſe, who, (as <hi>James</hi> ſhews in the 2d. <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Epiſtle,) affirmed, that Works were not needful, but Faith would ſave them, no ſayes <hi>James, that faith is dead and vain that wants works;</hi> And therefore remember 1. That although we tell you that Works are not properly the condition of the Covenant of Grace, yet we ſay that Faith and Works are never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat in a Juſtified Perſon; ſound Faith cannot but work, and put on to the ſtudy of Holineſſe; 2. We ſay, although Works concur not in the obtaining of pardon of Sin, yet we ſay they are needful to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to folks entry in to Heaven; For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.17. <hi>That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holineſs none ſhall ſee the Lord;</hi> Though it's Faith that makes our friendſhip, yet it's by holineſſe that it's entertained; and it's holineſſe whereby our communion is keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with God; Therefore, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. We are ſaid by it, <hi>to be made meet to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the inheritance of the ſaints in light;</hi> For it transforms us to Gods Image. 3. Works are neceſſary, though not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our peace, yet for the entertaining of our peace, and except we have Works, we cannot have a ſolid proof that our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith is real; and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, <hi>James</hi> ſayes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. that <hi>Abraham</hi> was Juſtified by Works; That is, by his Works he was declared to be a juſtified perſon; As to the Juſtification of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he was juſtified by Faith, before <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born; but by his offering up of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and other Fruits of his Faith, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and manifeſted to be a Juſtified man, and made ſuitable to the Covenant that he was ingaged in with God; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the ſum of all, be exhorted to ſtudy the exerciſe of Faith and Holineſſe, ſo as every one of them may have it's own room and place; for that will be your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and without this no other thing will advantage you, Now God himſelf that calleth for both, Sanctifie, and enable us for both.</p>

            <p>IT's a thing that can neither be eaſily believed, nor yet underſtood, how, <hi>by Chriſts knowledge,</hi> or by Faith in Him, <hi>many ſhall be juſtified;</hi> In theſe Words, the Prophet adds a Reaſon that both confirms and clears it; It ſhall be, ſaith he, that many ſhall be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied through Faith in Him, <hi>For he ſhall bear their iniquities;</hi> He ſhall take on, and pay their Debt; And ſo, (as I ſaid) it is a reaſon confirming the former Truth, and ſhewing that it cannot be otherwayes, but they muſt be abſolved through Faith in Him, becauſe He bears the puniſhment due to them for their Sin; It ſerves alſo to clear how Juſtification is attained by Faith, to wit, not by any vertue, or efficacy that is in Faith, abſtractly conſidered, as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of it ſelf did the turn, but by vertue of Chriſts bearing their iniquities, and making Satisfaction for them, which Faith layes hold on; So that when he ſaid, <hi>By his knowledge ſhall many be juſtified;</hi> It is not by any efficacy attributed to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, but by vertue of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and Satisfaction which only Faith gives a Title to; and is the midſe, and way by which a Believer comes to it; and ſo (as I have ſaid) it ſerves for explication of the former Truth: So that if the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be aſked, how can Sinners be Juſtified by believing? It's here anſwered, becauſe Chriſt ſhall take on their Debt, and the Righteouſneſſe purchaſed by Him ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to them, and be reckoned theirs; It's the ſame on the matter, with that which we have, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. He that knew no ſin, was made ſin for us,</hi> and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? <hi>That we might be made the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in him,</hi> which clears that this way of Juſtification which the Goſpel holds out, is not as (I juſt now ſaid) by any efficacy, or worth in Faith it ſelf, nor by any inherent qualifications in the perſon that believes; but this is the ground of it, Chriſts <hi>bearing of our iniquities;</hi> The Elect were Sinners, and Chriſt hath taken on Him their iniquities, Therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but upon their fleeing to Him by Faith be Juſtified, when they plead His Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for their Defence before God, their Abſolution muſt needs follow; This is the ſcop of theſe Words; which are as it were the bond knitting all the reſt together, and containing the foundation whereon our Juſtification is founded; There are only <hi>Three</hi> Words here that need a little of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. 1. By <hi>iniquity</hi> is not meaned Sin formally taken; We ſhew when we ſpake of the 6. <hi>v.</hi> That Chriſt was not the Sinner formally conſidered, that being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with His holy Nature, and with the perſonal union of the Man head with the God-head; But the meaning is, that He took on Him the puniſhment due to our iniquities; or the puniſhment that our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities deſerved. 2. When He is ſaid to <hi>bear</hi> their iniquities; it imports a burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome bearing, or His bearing of it with a weight, and that there was a weight in it, as it's ſaid, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. and 4. <hi>He was a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he hath born our griefs, and carried our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. ſaith, <hi>He his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the tree;</hi> when He <hi>was made a curſe for us;</hi> as it is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. He did bear our Sins, by coming under the Curſe that was due to us for them; In a word, His bearing of our iniquities is a
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:152256:250"/> real ſatisfying of the Juſtice of God for them; by interpoſing His own bleſſed back, and taking on the ſtroaks that were due to us. 3. When it's ſaid, <hi>Their iniquities,</hi> It relats to the <hi>many</hi> that in the former Words, are ſaid to be juſtified through His Knowledge, it's ſpoken of the iniquities of the Elect, and Believers, who through Chriſt are made friends with God; And therefore theſe being the <hi>many,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be Juſtified, becauſe Chriſt hath come, and payed their Debt, according to His Ingagement. Theſe Words as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every other <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſubſtance of the Goſpel; Take ſhortly <hi>Five</hi> or <hi>Six Obſervations</hi> from them, which we ſhall put together. The 1. Is, That the Perſon who is to be Juſtified by Faith in Chriſt, is naturally lying in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; this is ſuppoſed, while it is ſaid, that Chriſt <hi>ſhall bear their iniquities;</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ven the iniquities of them who are to be Juſtified, through Faith in Him; So it's ſaid before, <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all; and we all like ſheep have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray;</hi> Theſe, and many other Scriptures, nay the whole current of the Scriptures, confirm the point, and put it beyond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
            <p>I obſerve it for theſe <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Uſes,</hi> which will ſhew why it is ſo frequently marked. 1. That the freedom of Gods Grace may kyth the more in their Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; They are Sinners even as others are; and it's Grace that makes the diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; Therefore their Juſtification muſt be free; If then any would have good, or have gotten good by the Goſpel, and by Chriſt offered to them therein, let them know that it is freely. 2. That a Believer who is Juſtified ſhould be very humble, for he was a Sinner as well as others, and is ſtill a Sinner in part; Therefore it becomes him to walk fortly, with a ſtopped mouth, and to be tender and compaſſionat towards other Sinners; There is not a Believer, but the weight of his iniquities would have born him down to H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll, had not Chriſt interpoſed, and taken them on him; and therefore he ought to be both humble, and thankful. 3. That Sinners, who have the offer of Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe in the Goſpel, may not diſpair how great ſoever their Sins be; Indeed if they reſolve to continue in Sin, or to Sin that Grace may abound, they have no ground to expect pardon; the Apoſtle doth, with abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency reject the drawing of ſuch concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Grace of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. But for a guilty Sinner, that hath no good in himſelf to commend him to Chriſt, to lean to, and to believe in Him who juſtifies the ungodly, is a Doctrine which the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle approves, and gives an open door to them that deſire to abandon Sin, and to expect Juſtification through Chriſt's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; Thus a door is ſet open to you, to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To confound and ſtop the mouths of all Self-righteous men, as having nothing to do with Chriſt; He came to take on iniquity, and to bear it; <hi>He came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt,</hi> and hath not a commiſſion to ſave Self-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Folks; <hi>For he came not to call the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but ſinners to repentance;</hi> and ſo long as they continue in that condition; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not look on themſelves, as perſons whom He came to call, neither can they take any comfort in, or from His coming.</p>
            <p>The 2d. <hi>Obſervation</hi> is, That wherever iniquity is, it's a burden, a heavy burden, There is nothing more heavy then Sin, it being that which preſſes the guilty perſon to the loweſt Hell, It brought the fallen Angels out of Heaven, to the pit: ye may t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Is not that heavy, that hath brought on ſo many weighty curſes on the Creatures, and ſubjected them to vanity? Is not that heavy, that brings by it's weight ſo many thouſands and millions to Hell? and that made our bleſſed Lord to cry, yet without all ſinful anxiety, <hi>My God my God why haſt thou forſaken me; and my ſoul is heavy to the death?</hi> And is it not that which makes the Lord ſay, that <hi>He is preſſed,</hi> with his profeſſing peoples Sins, <hi>as a cart is preſsed with ſheaves;</hi> all the indignation, and oppoſition of the men of this World is nothing to Him, in compariſon of the Sins of His people; He can break through briers and thornes, and conſume them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; But the iniquities of His people are ſaid to preſſe Him; to ſhew the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable loathſomneſſe and weightineſſe of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 1. It may make us wonder that men and women think ſo little of Sin; There are many that will tuſh at a challenge or threatning for Sin; but let me ſay it, that mountains of Leid, yea, though all this World were turned into one Maſs, or Lump of Leid, it ſhould not be ſo heavy, as Sin ſhould be to you; your Drunkenneſs, Filthineſs, Covetouſneſs, Lying, the vag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mind in privat Duties of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip throughout the Week, and in publick Duties on the Lords Day; your neglect of Prayer in Secret, mocking at Piety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall (however light now) one day be found to be weighty; when as it is, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Ye ſhall cry to the hills and mountains to fall upon you, and hide you from the wrath of the Lamb;</hi> A mountain would be thought light in that day; but the Face and Wrath of the Lamb ſhall be terrible; Therefore, either give up with Sin, and ſtudy Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or make you for this dreadful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, that ye would wiſh to have a hill or a mountain tumbling on you; and yet ſhal not get that wiſh granted; what mean ye, O! Atheiſts, and deſperatly ſecure pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of your ſelves, with your idols, that ye dare thus to ly and live under this burden? Will ye be able to come before the Throne of God with it upon your back? It's a truth, that Sin is ſuch a burden as will ſink you to the pit, if ye ſeek not in Gods way to ſhake it off in time.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. If it be ſuch a burden, make this <hi>twofold</hi> Uſe of it. 1. Beware of keeping ſtill upon you the burden of bygone Sins; but take with them, ſeek to be ſuitably affected with them; betake your ſelves with all ſpeed to Chriſt, and caſt your ſelves, and your burden on Him; It's for this reaſon that Faith is called a <hi>leaning on Christ,</hi> becauſe, when the burden of Sin is like to break the Sinners back, Faith caſts himſelf, and his burden over on Chriſt. 2. For the time to come ſtudy holineſſe, and take on no more of this burden; alwayes remembring, that when ye take on the Debt of the leaſt Sin, or ſeek to hood-wink (as it were) the conſcience, and to put out the eyes of it, that ye may Sin the more ſecurely, and with the greater liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ye are all the while but hightning your burden, and making the weight of it the more intollerable; and is that wiſdom, think ye, to be taking on a burden of that which will preſſe, cruſh, ſink and drown you eternally under its grievous and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable weight.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That for as heavy a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as Sin is, Chriſt ſtooped down, and took it on His bleſſed back, <hi>John</hi> 1.29. <hi>Behold the lamb of God that taketh away,</hi> or beareth, and by bearing, taketh away <hi>the ſins of the world.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>He him own ſelf bear our ſins in his body on the tree, So the juſt ſuffered for the unjuſt; Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>ult. He was once offered to bear the ſins of many:</hi> Whether it was the ſame very burden that the Elect ſhould have born, or the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent of it, we will not now Debate hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoken ſomewhat more particularly to it before; either of them being according to the terms of the Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and accepted of the principal Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; yet it would ſeem that He did bear the curſe in the eſſentials of it, and in that reſpect came under the ſame burden; He died, becauſe it was threatned, <hi>The day thou eats, thou ſhalt ſurely die, and the ſoul
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:152256:251"/> that ſins ſhall die;</hi> and He died a curſed death, becauſe a curſed death was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as it is <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. compared with 13. And ſo come under the curſe: Here is love indeed, and a true friends kind turn, that when Sin was ſuch a heavy burden, Chriſt came in betwixt the Elect and it and took it on Himſelf, and ſtood at the Bar of God, as chargeable with our Debt, which was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged on Him, as it is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.6. <hi>He gave his back to the ſmiters and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; he bide not his face from ſhame, and ſpiting;</hi> all theſe buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of prophane ſouldiers, were but little to that weight of wrath that was laid on Him, to the making of Him groan; to that cup which in the Garden He drank out, and which made Him ſweat Blood; and cry our, <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful and heavy even unto death;</hi> And, <hi>Father if it be poſſible, let this cup paſſe from me, yet not my will, but thine be done:</hi> O! what a weight was it that made Him ſo cry out? There needs no more to prove that He bare our Sins, and that there was an exacting of Him what we were owing, and that His Sufferings are indeed a Satisfaction to Juſtice, for them, even for the Sins of all the Elect.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> are two, 1. It ſerves to hold out and confirm this truth, That our Lord Jeſus His Sufferings were a real Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Juſtice, for the Sins of the Elect; and that by His Sufferings He was indeed put to bear their iniquities, and that they were not only, nor mainly for example, though we may well make that uſe of them; but He was made ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for our Debt; we Sinned, and He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and Satisfied for our Sin, we debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our our Stock, and played the bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, He payed our Debt. 2. It ſerves hudgly to commend to us the Love of God, that gave His Son, and of the Mediator, that came to buy and redeem Elect Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, at ſo dear a rate, and to take on ſuch a weighty burden to eaſe them of it; Were there any here (as we hope there are) that know the weight of Sin, O! but they would think much of this; even of Chriſts taking on the burden of Sin, and caſting it by, having Satisfied Juſtice for it, and looſed the knot of the Law, and of the Curſe that tyed it to them; To become Man was much, but to bear the burden of our Sins was more; Angels wonder at this, that He, who is their head ſhould become ſo low, as to fiſt Himſelf before Gods Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and to undergo the Suffering of Death, and to take on the weighty burden of the Elects Debt, and to Satisfie for it; If we were in a right frame of Spirit, we could not hear this word, but it would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh our hearts, and put us to a pauſe, and holy <hi>nonplus;</hi> but the moſt part, alace! walk lightly under the burden of Sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever conſidering what Chriſt hath done to remove it from off His People; nay, I am afraid that Believers, who have ground to be lightned, through Chriſts condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bear their burden, do not as they ought acknowledge Him, who hath taken the burden off them.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly. From comparing theſe words with the former, <hi>Many ſhall be justified; for he ſhall bear their iniquities, Obſerve,</hi> That Chriſt's bearing of our iniquities, and His Satisfaction for our Sins, is imputed to us as the immediat ground of our Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Juſtification before God; So that if it were aſked, what is the ground on which a Sinner is Juſtified before God? The <hi>Text</hi> anſwers, Becauſe <hi>Chriſt hath born their iniquities,</hi> He hath payed their Debt, even as (to make compariſon fore clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it) when a Debtor is purſued, and hath nothing to pay, yet he pleads that the Debt cannot be exacted of him, becauſe his Cautioner hath payed it; and the ground on which that Debtor is abſolved, is his inſtructing that the Cautioner hath payed that Debt, which being done, he is ſet free; So is it here, The Believer he is Gods Debtor, Chriſt Jeſus is his Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, who hath payed his Debt; who, when he is brought to the Bar of God and ſomewhat is laid to his charge, he pleads upon the ground of Chriſts Satisfying for his Debt, and that therefore he ought not to be put to anſwer for it himſelf; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect?
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:152256:252"/> It is God that juſtifies, who ſhall condemn?</hi> and the ground fol ows, <hi>It is Chriſt that died,</hi> He hath payed the Debt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> Among other things, there are two conſequences that follow upon this Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, that ſerves to clear the Doctrine of Juſtification. 1. That the Righteouſneſſe whereby we are Juſtified, is imputed to us and accepted of God, as if it were our own: ye are ſometimes hearing of imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Righteouſneſſe, and it's of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to you to know it well, yet I am afraid, that many of you are very ignorant of it: I ſhall therefore, in a word or two explicat it, by comparing the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; The Righteouſneſſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works is an inherent Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as it is, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not by works of righteouſneſſe which we have done;</hi> It's a Righteouſneſſe of our own doing, made up of our Praying, Hearing, and other Duties, as they are Acts of ours; The Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Covenant of Grace, is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteouſneſſe, that is, when Chriſts doing and Suffering is accounted ours: Take both in this compariſon; The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the Covenant of Works is like a Debtor, or Tennent, his paying of his own Debt, or Rent, by his managing his buſineſſe providently, and dexterouſly, and none other is troubled with it; The Righteouſneſſe of the Covenant of Grace is like one that hath ſpent up and debauched all, and hath not one penny to pay his Debt or Rent with, but hath a worthy, able and reſponſal Cautioner, who hath payed for him; Both being purſued, and brought before the Judge; The firſt man is abſolved, becauſe what he was owing he payed it at the term preciſely, The other man grants, that he was owing the Debt, but pleads that his Cautioner hath payed it, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d the Law excepts of the Cautioners pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and purſues the Debtor no further, but abſolves him; So is it here, when the Believer comes to ſtand at Gods Bar, it is nothing in himſelf that he pleads upon, but it's Chriſts Sufferings; who ſaid on the Croſs, <hi>it is finiſhed,</hi> The Debt of my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is fully payed, and Faith pleading for Abſolution on that ground, according to the Law of Faith, he is abſolved, as if he had payed the Debt himſelf, or had been owing none: If then it ſhould be aſked, Believers, what ground have ye to expect to be Juſtified? The Prophet anſwers here, <hi>Chriſt hath born our iniquities,</hi> and this is the Believers Defence; and therefore ſee here a poſſibility to reconcile theſe <hi>Two,</hi> that ſome men ſcorn and flout at, as irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable, to wit, how one can be a Sinner, and yet Righteous, he may be ſinful in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and yet Righteous through the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, So, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. He was made ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God in him, Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him who juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſſe;</hi> The man ungodly in himſelf is juſtified through the Satisf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction of Chriſt, imputed to him for Righteouſneſſe, and laid hold on by Faith; as if he had not Sinned, or had actually ſatisfied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. This conſequence followeth, That it ſerves to clear how Faith Juſtifies; as when we ſay <hi>Faith is our righteouſneſſe, and is imputed to us for righteouſneſs,</hi> we are not to look on Faith properly, as a Grace in us, and divided, or abſtracted from the Object; no, by no means; but as it is a laying hold on the Object, It's <hi>Faith in him that juſtifies;</hi> and <hi>Through his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall many be juſtified,</hi> becauſe <hi>he ſhall bear their iniquities;</hi> Faith Juſtifies by vertue of Chriſts Satisfaction, and as tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of it; Faith does not Juſtifie, as it is an Act of Grace in the Sinner, but as cloſing with Chriſt the Object of it; even as in the ſimilitude we made uſe of before; It's not enough that the Cautioner hath p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yed ſuch a mans Debs, but the man muſt inſtruct it by producing the Diſcharge; the production whereof is the cauſe of his Abſolution in Law; yet the vertue that makes the Diſcharge ſo to concur, is not the Diſcharge it ſelf, but the Cautioners pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Satisfaction mentioned, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Sinners Diſcharge; even ſo is it here, It's Chriſts Righteouſneſſe that concurreth, as the meritorious cauſe of the
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:152256:252"/> Sinners Abſolution, and Faith concurres as the Inſtrumental Cauſe, in the pleading of that Defence, whereon Juſtification fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, as an effect of theſe Cauſes: We know not when, or if ever hereafter we may have occaſion to ſpeak ſo much to the Doctrine of Juſtification; Therefore let me preſſe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>udy of it upon you again and again; Seek to know what this imputed Righteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5ly. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That although Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus hath born the iniquities of many, even of all His own people, yet not the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all men and women, but only the iniquities of them that ſhall be Juſtified, and brought to the actual poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſion of that which He hath purchaſed: This may be made out from theſe <hi>Three</hi> in the Text, 1. The relative <hi>Their,</hi> It's <hi>their</hi> iniquities, which are born by Chriſt, that ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>able then the Doctrine of univerſal Redemption a thouſand times; For it joyns Chriſts dying, and the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all that believe on Him; So that there are none, that by Faith betakes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Him, but they may expect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the Curſe, and Abſolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne of God; Whereas the Doctrine of univerſal Redemption, ſaith Chriſt hath died for all, yet all ſhall not be ſaved; and I wot not whether I ſhall be ſaved or not; and what ground of anxiety is that? but this Doctrine hath ſolid conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it; Chriſt hath not died for all ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but for all Believers, he hath born all their Sins; But I have betaken my ſelf to Him by Faith, therefore He died for me, He hath born my iniquities, and I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bear them my ſelf, but be Juſtified.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe we need not to ſtay on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this, 1. It's impregnably proved from the reaſoning of the Prophet in this place; All that are Believers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be Redeemed and Juſtified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He hath born their iniquities, who by Faith betake themſelves to Him. 2. If Faith in Chriſt be a ſaving Fruit of His Death, and if none can believe but theſe, whoſe iniquities He hath born; then where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Faith is, the perſon may conclude, that Chriſt hath born his iniquities, and that he ſhall be juſtified; But Faith in Chriſt is a ſaving Fruit and Effect of His Death, for He hath purchaſed it among the reſt of theſe Spiritual bleſſings ſpoken of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. Where we are ſaid to <hi>be bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings in him;</hi> and it being a Promiſe of the Covenant of Grace, it cannot but be purchaſed by the Death of the Teſtator Chriſt Jeſus; Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. It's clear alſo from the Apoſtles reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life;</hi> Will he not, who hath payed ſuch a dear price for us, to purchaſe reconciliation to us, make it out by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing on us the Fruits of His purchaſe?</p>
            <p>The 1. <hi>Uſe</hi> Serves to vindicat this our Doctrine concerning Chriſts dying for, and bearing the iniquities of Believers only; which is moſt unjuſtly loaded with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and debated againſt, by mens cavillings, as if it were a comfortleſs Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine; ſure it's more comfortable, more ſure, and more agreeable both to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Grace of God, then the Doctrine of univerſal Redemption is, For put theſe together, That all Believers are redeemed and juſtified; That Chriſt hath born their iniquities; that Faith is a ſaving Grace, and a Fruit of Chriſts Death, that ſuch as believe may conclude their Juſtification; and that Chriſt will make out the benefits of His purchaſe to them, what want Believers that may be for their comfort? Whereas, if we ſhould lay it for a ground, that Chriſt died for <hi>all,</hi> what comfort were in that? For all are not Juſtified, and Saved, but only Believers; yea, by the Doctrine of univerſal Redemption, though ye were even new Believers, ye could not conclude that ye ſhould be ſaved, becauſe ye might fall from it again: But our Doctrine of Juſtification hath ſolid conſolation, For, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>It is the power of God unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to every one that believes:</hi> And, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.12. <hi>It's unto all, and upon all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;</hi> And it makes the Believer ſure of his perſeverance, for it's an expreſſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Covenant. We ſhall only ſay this; That ye will find that all that, in Doctrine, or Practice make the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven wydeſt, they make it moſt unſicker, and unſure, and they are in great confuſion; and indeed it's impoſſible it can be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes; For if men go once out of Gods way, which is the ſtrait and narrow way, they can never be ſicker and ſolidly ſure, becauſe there is no ſolid ground of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in it.</p>
            <p>The 2. <hi>Uſe,</hi> ſerves, to anſwer a <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that ſome out of curioſity puſſel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with, which if well, ſoberly, and
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:152256:253"/> wiſely followed, would be do curioſity, and it is this; How ſhall I know if Chriſt died for me? Anſwer, make it ſure that ye believe, and then ye ſhall be ſure of the benefits of His Death; For if He hath born the iniquities of theſe that believe, and if there be no way to make it ſure, that He hath born our iniquities but by believing; it is a needleſſe ſtir and noiſe that is made about the knowledge of Election, and of Chriſts intention in His Death, for though we would ſay that He died for all, it would not comfort, except we ſaid alſo, that all go to Heaven; But are ye burdened with Sin, and have ye by Faith fled unto Chriſt? and do ye actually reſt upon Him? Then ye may on that ground conclude your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt's Death, and from that aſcend to Election; That which makes many Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to be in heſitation as to this, is their never throughing, and making it clear to themſelves, whether they have believed; and therefore, if ye would ſee your Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Intereſt in Chriſts Death, put the matter of your believing to a point; For it's the door whereby ye win in to other ſecrets of God, ſuch as Election is; and there is no other way to win to it; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe two are knit together, <hi>John</hi> 6.39, 40. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that of all that he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing;</hi> And if it ſhould be aſked, How ſhall I know, who are given to Chriſt to be redeemed by Him? The next <hi>verſe,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him may have everlaſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day:</hi> would ye then know who are given and redeemed? They are Believers; I mean of ſuch as are come to Age; for none will make the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion concerning Infants; And therefore if ye would know the way of the coming to Knowledge of your Juſtification, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and Election of God; begin at the loweſt ſtep of believing, and make that ſicker and all the reſt will follow of will; but if ye miſken and overlook this, and will go up to the top of the ladder, <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> and at the firſt; it will be juſt with God that ye never win at the Knowledge of theſe ſecrets which were in His heart before the World was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 3. It's matter of Conſolation to the Believer; who may as certainly conclude an intereſt in Chriſt's Death, as if he had heard the Tranſaction of Redemption read over, and had ſeen his name in the Book of Life, For our Lord ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten ſon, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life:</hi> If thou be a Believer thy name is there, Chriſt hath born thy iniquities; and what Conſolation is that to them who are clear anent their Faith? But, alace! it ſayes there is much Rotten, Unſound, and Slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery Faith among us, and alſo much Faith that is but little lively, that there is ſo little ſolid comfort following it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 4. It ſerves to demonſtrat the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c ſſity of believing the advantages of it, and the neceſſity of our indeavouring to be clear that we do believe; If theſe two go together, Juſtification and Believing, then there is a neceſſity of Believing, and if theſe two go together, clearneſs about our Believing, and the Knowledge that Chriſt did bear our iniquities; then there is in ſome reſpect a neceſſity, that we know we believe; otherwayes we can have little, or no comfort in Chriſts bearing of our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and of our being given to Chriſt to be redeemed by Him; From theſe two the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Believing may appear, Therefore to make all ſure, Juſtification, Chriſts bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your iniquities, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed, that the benefits of His death might be made forthcoming for them, for whom He died.</p>
            <p>Thus ye ſee we have the ſum of Gods Covenant here, as if the Lord were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to the Mediator; Now Son, if thou wilt pour out thy Soul unto death, and thereby bear the Sins of my Elect People, and make interceſſion for them, thou ſhalt loſſe nothing by it, thou ſhalt have a not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Victory, and Triumph, and a great Spoil; In the Words before, The Mediator having accepted the Terms of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and performed them, though not actually at that time, but in the Purpoſe and Decree of God; which now are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally performed, therefore the Promiſes are turned over in a concluded Covenant, and in an abſolute Right to Him.</p>
            <p>What needs further explication, we ſhal endeavour to reach it, as we ſpeak to the <hi>Obſervations,</hi> and becauſe the Words for the moſt part yeeld the ſame Doctrines that have been ſpoken to before, we ſhall not inſiſt in them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then from the repitition, <hi>Obſerve,</hi> in general, That the nature and terms of the Covenant of Redemption betwixt God, and the Mediator, is a profitable Doctrine, and uſeful to be underſtood, and believed by the People of God; Therefore it is ſo clearly propoſed, and again and again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, and laid before their eyes; and ſummed and repeated in this <hi>verſe,</hi> to keep them in mind of it; Theſe that know the Covenant of Redemption, as that which hath in it the ſum of all the Foundations of our Faith, and the ground of our acceſs to God, and of our peace with Him; they will eaſily grant that, that it's very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be ſtudied, known, and believed; For <hi>Firſt,</hi> by it we know what we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from God, becauſe what we are to expect, is promiſed to Chriſt in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as to our head; <hi>This portion with the great, and this dividing of the ſpoil with the ſtrong,</hi> He hath it as our head. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know by this Covenant, how we come by theſe things promiſed: <hi>And that is by pouring out of his ſoul into death, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſins,</hi> and <hi>interceeding for us;</hi> Which ſuppoſes, and includes our betak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſelves unto Him by Faith. 3. Becauſe by this Covenant, the rich and free Grace of God hath it's due Glory; For there is nothing conſidered here, as the reaſon of ſetting captives free, but Chriſts paying of the Price; it comes freely to us, as a gift beſtowed.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. And more particularly, <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That though our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the Work of Sinners Redemption, had a ſore Combat and Fight, yet He hath a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Out-gate, Triumph, and Victory; It was the greateſt, faireſt, and moſt ſerious onſet, and aſſault that ever was heard of, that our Lord Jeſus encountered with; As the remembrance, and conſideration of what hath been ſpoken, of His <hi>being in an agony, and ſweating drops of blood, of his</hi>

If we conſider what our Lord Jeſus was in His Perſon, being the Son of God, He cannot but be glorious, <hi>John</hi> 17.5. He proves, <hi>Father glorifie me with the glory which I had with thee before the world was;</hi> Though by being Man, He became of no reputation; and a vail was drawn over the declarative Glory of the God-head in His Perſon for a time; yet He remained ſtill the Son of God, and Glorious in Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and it cannot be but He that is God muſt be Glorious in His Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is not meant in reſpect of Thraldom and Bondage, but in reſpect of Voluntary Subjection to Him: This is a moſt noble, notable, and lovely Victory, and Triumph, and a Glorious Day indeed, which is ours, as well as His; it being the redeeming of poor Captive-ſinners, and bringing in of many followers to the Lamb; and therefore, <hi>v.</hi> 11.

It's a number of poor Sinners; <hi>Come to me ſays he, ye bleſsed of my Father, inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you,</hi> He hath no more, He ſeeks no more, but ſo many Souls as He minded to do good to; <hi>When the Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Nations,</hi> as it is, <hi>Pſal.

The Glory of His <hi>Obedience,</hi> when He hath it to ſay, as it is, <hi>John</hi> 18.9. <hi>Of all that thou haſt given me, I have loſt none;</hi> He gets ſo many Souls committed to Him of the Father to redeem, and when He hath done, and performed the Work, and brought them in, He hath the Glory of His Obedience to His Father, who ſaith to Him: <hi>Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> 2. The glory of His <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,</hi> according as He did ingage, and undertake to Jehovah, He hath keeped His Word, and there is a neceſſity lying on Him, that it ſhould be ſo, that of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Him, He ſhould loſſe none, but preſent them without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; Therefore He is called the <hi>Faithful ſhepherd,</hi> becauſe He loſſes none of the Sheep that are given Him. 3. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>infinit love,</hi> the moe that are ſaved, the more Grace and Love ſhins forth in paying their Debt, and Ranſome, and in bringing them in to be partakers of His <hi>Love;</hi> Therefore, <hi>John</hi> 17. He ſayes, <hi>That the love wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them, and I in them;</hi> He would have the love communicated by the Father to Him, to be in them, that it may be

            <p n="4">4. The Glory of <hi>Power</hi> ſhines forth here, that trampled upon, and triumphs over all difficulties, that are in the way of ſaving Elect Sinners; And, O! what difficulties there are in the way of ſaving Sinners?

They are ſaid <hi>to be keeped by the power of God, through Faith unto Salvation;</hi> In a Word, as it was the manner of old for Conquerors to ride in Triumph, and all their Priſoners led after or before them, at their back: So our Lord, for manifeſting the Glory of His Grace, Faithfulneſſe and Power brings ſo manny Sinners through, to Glory, and hath ſo a greater train, then ever any Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had; and He counts it His Glory, and Triumph to get many loſt Souls ſaved, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me, and I am glorified in them;</hi> How is that? <hi>I have given them thy word, and they have received it;</hi> He counts himſelf glorified in Sinners ſubmitting to Him, in their believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Him, and in their taking pardon from Him: Now let me ſay, that if we were wailling and making choiſe of a <hi>Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> to warn the heart of a ſenſible Sinner, to ſhame unbelief out of the World, and to give impregnable ground to hazard on Chriſt; here it is, That our Lord Jeſus placeth His Victory, Glory, and Triumph and Spoil in this, even in doing good to Sinners, and in having Sinners getting good of Him; It's His Portion when (to ſay ſo) the World is dealt, that He gets a number of loſt Sinners to ſave as His ſhare; And though He be the Heir of all things, and the firſt born, yet He loves that better then a thouſand Kingdoms; When He hath His Spoil, and Prey at the taking, this is it, and He choiſeth no other; O! Sinners do ye think this little? Or do ye think little of this? Had He placed His Glory, in cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under foot all the priſoners of the Earth, or in bringing the World to nothing, who could have ſaid, what doeſt thou? But when He placeth His Glory and Triumph in this, to overcome the Devil, to caſt him out of Souls, to relieve poor Sinners, and to bring them in to acknowledge Him, as the <hi>Author of eternal ſalvation,</hi> and as <hi>the author and finiſher of their faith;</hi> If ye would have ſomething to wonder at, is it not here? He will burn the World into aſhes, and leave it, and will caſt many Kings and great Men into Hell, and yet He gathers poor Elect Sinners out of that burnt heap, as it were, as the thing He hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for His Spoil; He hath no more, and He ſeeks no more, (as I ſaid) and yet He gets no ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n of theſe poor Sinners for all this.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as the, 1. <hi>Uſe</hi> of it, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this, will it not be a glorious day, when Chriſt is Crowned, and hath all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Sinners at His back, with harps in their hands, Singing, Salvation, Glory and Power, to the Lamb? O! wonder, that there is not only a Saviour, and Life and Salvation to be had through Him; but that it's ſuch a Salvation, as is wonderful in this reſpect, that He counts it His Glory, and Triumph to have many Sinners ſaved, when He might have glorified Himſelf in ſending us all to hell; May we not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this? and yet we ought to believe it, and the little Faith of it makes it be ſo little wondered at; Ah! Sinners for moſt part believes not that Chriſt thinks ſo much of the ſaving of ſinners; and therefore they wonder not at it, are not ſuitably affected, and taken up with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 2. There is here a ſweet and ſolid ground for quieting, and ſetling the Faith of ſenſible Sinners, who would have foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Faith; Chriſt counts it His Glory and Triumph to ſave ſuch as ye are, and if ye periſh that would fain be at Chriſt and His Righteouſneſſe for Life; Chriſt ſhall want His Glory and Triumph, and may not that ſerve and ſatisfie you? that your Salvation is His Glory and Triumph,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:152256:257"/> which He will not come ſhort of; The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath here promiſed it; and He ſhall not, He cannot want it; Sinners, He muſt have, and ſhall have to be ſaved, becauſe His Victory, Triumph and Spoil depends on it; A wonderful condeſcenſion of Grace (which is not eaſily believed) that all theſe are linked and coupled together, and through other, as it were, Sinners Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Chriſts Victory, Triumph, and Spoil, and Gods Glory in His Grace Love, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and Power; ye reflect, no doubt on Gods Faithfulneſſe, who ſuſpect, and are jealous of your Salvation, if indeed ye do by Faith betake your ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 3. Doth Chriſt think ſo much of the Salvation of Sinners, that He counts it His Victory and Triumph, His Portion and Spoil? Then, 1. All that give not Chriſt their Souls to be ſaved, do what they can to leſſen Chriſts Portion, and to fruſtrat Him of His Glory. 2. If ye would do Chriſt ſervice that is moſt acceptable to Him, give Him your Souls to be ſaved by Him; fruſtrat not His Grace, lay your Sins on Him, and look for Salvation through Him in His own way; He came to fight with Principalities and Powers, and to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh them, and by the ſtrong hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue Souls from them; and ſtep ye to at His back, for that is His Satisfaction, His Portion and Spoil; We wote well, there is here a ſtrong and effectual motive to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to Faith in Chriſt; and a ſtronger and more effectual cannot be thought upon; It will be Chriſts Triumph, to pull you out of the claws of the Devil, and if He do it not, ye on the matter allow the Devil, ſome way to get the victory over Chriſt, which is yet impoſſible, but the Devil will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have Victory over you; to whom ye will be Slaves, and Druges for ever; There is alſo here ground of great terrour, and of dreadful warning to ſuch as yeelds not to Chriſt, becauſe they do what they can to impede His Victory; when He comes by His ordinances <hi>to turn them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan to God,</hi> they thwart with Him; The day is coming, when this Doctrine will be comfortable to ſome, and terrible to others, when there ſhall be none of us, but we ſhall ſee it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with our eyes, when He (as a man ſorting and ſharing His Spoil after the Vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, ſhall ſay to theſe on His right hand, <hi>Come ye bleſsed of my father inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you;</hi> and to others, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels;</hi> Even as if a Conquerour ſhould take ſome Priſoners, and make them Sons, and Heirs, and ſet them upon Thrones, and ſhould caſt others into perpetual Priſon, who loved not liberty: And indeed it will be a fearful Priſon who loved not liberty; And indeed it will be a fearful Priſon to be in Hell with the Devil, and His Angels; either we will be part of Chriſts Portion, and Spoil in that day, or He will refuſe, diſown, and reject us, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to be an everlaſting prey to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; happy they whom He choiſeth, and woe to them eternally whom He caſts, as refuſe wair God give us wiſdom to lay theſe things to heart.</p>

            <p>THis Covenant of Redemption is a great bargain; there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch parties as the Lord Jehovah, and the Mediator; and we may ſay there was never ſuch Conditions, and Articles in any bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as are in this; The verſe now read doth contain the ſum of that which was agreed upon, betwixt theſe Parties; The promiſes upon Jehovahs ſide made to the Mediator, and what He ſhall have on His ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of the offer, and performing of the Condition required of Him; And what are the terms propoſed to the Mediator, and the Conditions which He is to perform, or rather hath performed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are two things promiſed to the Mediator, <hi>I will divide him a portion with the great,</hi> a fair and large Victory, and a good and glorious Out-gate; And <hi>He ſhal divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong;</hi> As theſe that are Conquerours and Victors uſe to ſhare moſt largely, and deeply in the Spoil, ſo our Lord Jeſus ſhall have a rich Spoil, a large booty, many redeemed Souls, a Bride whom He ſhall preſent blameleſſe to the Father; Theſe are the Spoil, the Jewels that He fights for, and the Prey He choiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; when the World is burnt, and the reſt are ſent to hell, He gathers out ſo many for Himſelf. 2. The Conditions on the Mediators ſide are four; He comes to this Victory, and Triumph, becauſe <hi>He hath poured out His ſoul unto death;</hi> becauſe <hi>He was numbred with tranſgreſſours;</hi> becauſe <hi>He bare the ſins of many;</hi> and becauſe <hi>He made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſours,</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall He be ſure of all this.</p>
            <p>Although there be no expreſſe name of a Covenant here; yet ye ſee the thing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as in Covenants amongſt men there are two parties, and their ingagements are mutual, and the performance of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements in the one depends on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them in the other; So is it here. 1. The Parties are Jehovah, and the Mediator. 2. There are two things promiſed to the Mediator, a glorious Vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, and a rich Spoil, the juſtifying of many. 3. The Conditions on the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators ſide, on which the performance of the promiſes depends, He condeſcends to die, and to die willingly, to be numbred with tranſgreſſours, to bear their Sins; and to make interceſſion for them; This Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah condeſcends to accept of, and upon this <hi>many,</hi> to wit, all Elect Sinners are <hi>juſtified through faith on him,</hi> as it is, <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the promiſe made to Chriſt (where the Perſon is changed) <hi>I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong,</hi> I will grant Him ſuch a thing, and He ſhall obtain it, Take this general <hi>Obſervation,</hi> as the reaſon of it; That all the Promiſes made by Jehovah to the Mediator are certain, and ſhall actually be performed, I will grant this to Him, and He ſhall get it; The connexion doth alſo confirm it; <hi>Becauſe he hath poured out his Soul unto death:</hi> So, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
               <pb n="511" facs="tcp:152256:258"/> 89.34, 35. <hi>Once I ſware by my holineſs, that I will not lie unto David; my covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips;</hi> And indeed it cannot but be ſo; If we conſider either the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that makes the Promiſe; He is God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in Himſelf, abſolutely faithful, and cannot deny Himſelf, <hi>Once have I ſworn and I will not lie unto David;</hi> Or the party to whom the Promiſe is made, He is the Mediator God-man, in whom the Father is well pleaſed; And the Mediator having performed what He undertook for the Elect, There is no ground to queſtion the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the promiſes made to Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> And it is a very comfortable one; look, whatever is promiſed to the Mediator in reference to Particular, Privat, or Publick Mercies, all ſhall be moſt certainly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruſtrably performed: Chriſt is the Party, to whom the Promiſes are made, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah cannot fail to perform what is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the Mediator, more then the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator hath failed in performing what He undertook: Now it's promiſed to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holineſſe, from the womb of the morning, tbou haſt the dew of thy youth:</hi> Where there are theſe things promiſed to Chriſt. 1, That His People ſhall be made willing, in the day of His power; which is expon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me; except the Father who hath ſent me draw him,</hi> God takes away the ſtubborneſſe, and frowardneſs that is in the Elect, and makes them plyable to embrace, and receive, and give up themſelves to Chriſt. 2. That His People ſhall be numerous, the youth of His womb ſhall be numerous, as the dew in the morning. 3. They ſhall be holy, and ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in holineſs, <hi>In the beauty of holineſs;</hi> Again, it's promiſed to the Mediator, that all Believers in Him ſhall be Juſtified, as it's <hi>verſe</hi> 11. <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many,</hi> and this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>John</hi> 6.39, 40. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that of all that he hath given me, I ſhould loſse none, and this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life:</hi> The poor Sinner that by Faith betakes himſelf to Gods Promiſe the Promiſe cannot fail him, becauſe the Mediator is conſidered as the party, to whom the Promiſe is made; and the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Salvation and Redemption of Believers is in the ſame place Promiſed; Though they be in hazard through many Sins, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling Luſts, Tentations and Snares, to be drawn away, yet <hi>they ſhall have eternal life, they ſhall never periſh, none ſhall pluck his ſheep out of his band; He ſhall ſee his ſeed, of all that are given him, he ſhall loſs none:</hi> This would commend believing to us, as a ſure and ſicker bargain; becauſe the ground of our Faith is Articled betwixt God and the Mediator, and it's as Impoſſible that it can fail, as it's impoſſible that God can be unfaithful, and that the Mediator can fail, in that He is ingaged. Again, if ye look to promiſes of publick mercies, as that He ſhall have a Church in the World, and that ſhe ſhall be continued and preſerved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Promiſes ſhall certainly be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>I have ſet my king upon my holy hill of zion, ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thy inhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is proclaimed, <hi>The kingdoms of this
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:152256:259"/> world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt:</hi> All theſe, and many the like Promiſes, ſhall be accompliſhed; though the World ſhould be turned upſide down every moneth once, let be every year; The ground of the Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and preſervation is not, becauſe ſuch and ſuch perſons govern: otherwayes, what would have become of the Church when Antichriſt prevailled, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to the Mediator: Here lyeth the Chriſtians peace, when he hath to do with challenges, it's impoſſible that the Believer in Chriſt can periſh: And here is inſured the Churches preſervation, even by Gods promiſe to the Mediator, that He ſhall have a Seed, and that many ſhall be Juſtified, that He ſhall divide the Spoil: And though we ſee but very little appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſpreading of the Goſpel amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> or where Antichriſt reigns; the viſible Church being now for many years rather incroached upon then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; yet there is not one Word here promiſed, but it ſhall be accompliſhed; And this is both a ground of our peace, and of our confidence in prayer, as it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Prayer alſo ſhall be made for him continually, and dayly ſhall he be praiſed:</hi> Two ſweet exerciſes, dayly to be praying for that which is in the pattern of prayer, <hi>Let thy kingdom come,</hi> and dayly to be praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Him for the coming of His Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But 2ly. What is ſpoken of Chriſt the Mediators part, we take it for granted, that there is nothing ſpoken of, but it is, or ſhall be performed; The Father ingages to perform to Him, whatever Promiſes are made to Him, becauſe He hath performed whatever He undertook; and although <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> long ere the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> came in the Fleſh, ſpake of it as a thing done in the preterit, or by-paſt time, when as yet it was not actually done; yet He doth ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was as certain as if it had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done: <hi>Obſerve,</hi> hence, That there is no part of Chriſts undertaking, as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator in the Covenant of Redemption, but it is, and ſhall be actually performed; O! but there are two reſponſal and faithful Par ies in this Covenant; it is not God and <hi>Adam</hi> who brake the Covenant, and played the Traitor; but it's God upon the one ſide, and the Mediator <hi>Immanuel</hi> God with us, on the other ſide: Therefore there is faithfulneſſe in the Mediators per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming according to His undertaking, as well as there is faithfulneſſe in Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming whatever He hath ſpoken of Him, or promiſed to Him: Ye ſhall only take two or three teſtimonies for this; The, 1. is <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.14. and 17.5. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to ſatisfie for the Elects Debt, and hath accordingly performed it, ſo that the Father is well pleaſed, A 2d. is, <hi>John</hi> 17.4. Where He appeareth before the Father, and uſeth it for an argument for His <hi>Glorifying him with the ſame glory he had with the father before the world was: I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do;</hi> I have gotten a taſk, and piece of Work committed to me, and now it's performed; And that other Word which He hath on the Croſs, is remarkable to this purpoſe; <hi>It's finiſhed:</hi> Now the taſk and work is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I have no more to do, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to paſſe to the Victory, and to the dividing of the Spoil: And a 3d. Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is our Lord Jeſus His aſcenſion to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the glory that He will appear in, at the day of Judgement, when His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall be conſummat; That ſhall be a proof and teſtimony, that He left nothing undone, that was given Him to do, that He bare the Sins of many, that He gave His back to the ſmiters, and His cheeks to them that pulled of the hair, and that He ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied juſtice freely, and aſcended to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as it is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Great is the myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God was manifeſted in the fleſh, justified in the ſpirit,</hi> fully abſolved, as having performed all whatſoever He undertook, <hi>Seen of Angels and raiſed up unto glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> This is alſo, though a general, yet a very comfortable Doctrine, to the People of God; in as far, as from it, they may know that there is no more to be payed to the Juſtice of God for the Sins of the Elect; It hath gotten full Satisfaction, The Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:152256:259"/> hath payed all their Debt, and is now exercing His Offices, for applying to them His purchaſe; making interceſſion for them, overſeeing them, proving a Tutor to them, guiding them, and all that concerns them, and His Church; even doing all things well, managing the affairs of His Fathers houſe, as a Son, and He cannot but guide all well, <hi>Other ſheep,</hi> ſaith He, <hi>I have, which are not of this fold, them</hi> I <hi>must bring in, and they ſhall hear my voice, and I give them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh;</hi> A moſt pregnant ground of comfort to the Believer, that his eternal well-being cannot but be ſure, and ſicker, becauſe it hath the Father and the Mediator their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ingaged for it; If Jehovah perform the Promiſes made to the Mediator, and if the Mediator perform His ingagement, to Jehovah, and raiſe up Believers at the laſt day, then it muſt follow, that their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is ſure: This is the main ground on which Believers peace is founded; and here we may allude to that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>He hath ſworn by two immutable things, wherein it is impoſſible for God to lie, that the heirs of promiſe, who are fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope ſet before them, may have strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation:</hi> even ſo here, There are two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable things, to wit, Gods promiſe to the Mediator, and God will, and muſt keep His Word to Him, and the Mediators ingagement to God, and He will and muſt keep His Word to Him; And indeed we have good proof of both already: For it was this ingagement that made the Father ſend the Son of His Love, out of His bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, to be incarnat, and to undergo the work of Elect Sinners Redemption; and it was this ingagement that made the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator die; of whom the Father exacted the Price, till He declared Himſelf Satisfied, and well pleaſed: Now when theſe things that ſeemed moſt difficult are accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what can fail?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then there is here ground to fix our Faith upon, and indeed there is need to fix it rightly; The ground that our Salvation, and Perſeverance in the Faith is founded on, is not our continuing to Pray, to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and to Love God, but this ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt the Father and the Son; and it is the cauſe procuring the other, as an neceſſary and infallibly certain effect; It's mainly on this, that believers ſhuld reſt quiet and confident. 2. It ſhould make Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers humble and cheerful, ſeeing, though they be weak in themſelves, yet here they have a grip, and hold for every hand, as it were; Jehovah's Word, and the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators Word for their through bearing. 3. It ſhould much commend believing, and the ſtate of a Believer, who have ſuch ground of aſſurance; The greateſt Monarch on earth hath not ſuch ground of aſſurance for his Dinner or Supper, as the poor Believer hath for eternal Life; For the Word ſpoken by Jehovah to the Mediator, and the undertaking of the Mediator to Jehovah, cannot fail; and the Believer hath that to reſt upon, as the ground of his aſſurance.</p>
            <p>More particularly, The Articles on the Mediators ſide are (as I ſaid) in theſe <hi>Four</hi> expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſions, <hi>He hath poured out his ſoul unto death; He was numbred with the tranſgreſsours, he bare the ſins of many; and made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſours:</hi> 1. <hi>He muſt die,</hi> expreſſed in theſe Words, <hi>He poured out his ſoul unto death;</hi> Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes <hi>Three</hi> things. 1. That it is an Article of the Covenant of Redemption, and of the Mediators undertaking that he ſhould die for Sinners; And ſo it is a needleſſe, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and unwarrantable diſpute, whether fallen man might have been redeemed any other way, or whether a drop of His blood was not enough to redeem man? becauſe we ſee here it is Determined, and Articled in the Covenant of Redemption, that He ſhould die, Jehovah will have the Mediator dying; And be poſſible what may to Gods Soveraignity (which we would not make to claſh with His Juſtice, nor His Juſt ce with His Soveraignity) this may bound and limit us, that it's concluded in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption, that the Mediator ſhall lay down His Life, and it being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; It's certain. 1. That God hath given man a Law, threatning him, that if he ſhould break that Law, he ſhould die. 2. That all Mankind, and ſo the Elect have
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:152256:260"/> broken that Law, and ſo are lyable to the Threatning and Curſe. 3. That the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator became Cautioner, and undertook to ſatisfie for the Elects Debt; it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that He ſhould die becauſe He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to pay their Debt, and to ſatisfie for their Sin, which was death by the Law to them; and ſo the Juſtice of God is vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat, He cannot be called unjuſt, nor partial, nor unholy, though He do not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally puniſh every Sinner, that hath Sinned in his own Perſon, becauſe Gods holineſſe and Juſtice appears conſpicuouſly, that He would rather execute what was due to the Elect on His own Son, then that their Sins ſhould go unpuniſhed: And conſidering the nature of the Mediators death, that it was a violent and curſed death, that which had extream anguiſh and ſorrow going before, and alongſt with it; It ſhews that the Lord hath purpoſly taken that way, to make it known how bitter a thing Sin is, how terrible a thing His Wrath is, and how holily ſevere His Law is; and to let all know that it is a dreadful thing to come in topes with Him, who did ſo put His own Son to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 1. This <hi>Doctrine,</hi> though it hath been ſpoken to before, is a ſoveraign Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, yea, <hi>the</hi> Soveraign Doctrine, and the corner ſtone of all Religion; That Chriſt hath died for the Sins of His People; It gives us acceſſe to preach the Goſpel, which is therefore called, <hi>the preaching of Chriſt crucified;</hi> know therefore, and believe that the Mediator died; and that it behoved Him to die: For it was required as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant of Redemption, to be performed by Him, to which He yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and conſented; O! what love is here to article ſuch a thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>g before Sinners had any Being; It was more then to be hungry and thirſty, and weary, He behoved to die, and to be made a curſe; when Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and burnt Offerings will not do; He ſayes, <hi>Lo I come in the volumne of the book, it's written of me, I delight to do will, O! my God,</hi> I hearitily accept of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 2. It ſpeaks an ſadly alarming Word to all you who are ſecure Athieſts, and care not for the Wrath of God; O! what will become of you, when the Wrath of God and you ſhall meet; If Sin brought the Cautioner to death, O! what Wrath ſhal ye come under, when ye ſhall be put to reckon for your own Sins? The ſmitting of the Sheperd was more then if all the Sheep had been ſmitten; and though now ye think little of Sin, yet the day comes wherein ye ſhall know to your coſt, that <hi>it is an evil and bitter thing to depart from God,</hi> and that <hi>it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi>

See here the neceſſity of making uſe of Chriſts Death, either ye muſt do it, or die, and come under the Curſe of God your ſelves; there is not a midſe; If ye have Sin, how will it be gotten put by and ſatisfied for? not by your Prayers; let be by a laughter or ſmile; nor by your living of an honeſt life, as ye call it, Chriſt had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly more of this then any of you, and yet He got not Sin ſo put by; we may here allude to that, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.8. <hi>There is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in tbat war, neither ſhall wickedneſs deliver theſe that are given to it;</hi> Death when it hath a commiſſion, and Gods Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour backing it, O! how will it handle the ſecure ſtubborn Sinner, when the hand of God ſhall purſue him eternally? Alace, what are many doing that never fear the Wrath of God, that ſuſpend, put of, and delay the cloſing of their accompts, and all endeavours to die to Sin, and to live to Righteouſneſſe; and either paſſe over their dayes as Athieſts, or as formal Hypocrites; and ſuch are ſome of you, that hear me this day, who never ſeek to be found in Chriſt, nor to improve His death to the mortifying of Sin; What will ye do in the day when ye ſhall be called to a reckoning? ye will curſe the day that ever ye heard the Goſpel, and that this was concluded that Chriſt ſhould die, it will be the ſavour of death to you, through all eternity; and will be the moſt Soul-ſearching, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Word that ever ye heard; and ye will wiſh that the Work of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had never been heard of, nor reſolved upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 4. It's a comfortable, and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:152256:260"/> Word to ſenſible Sinners; ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking themſelves to Chriſt, may be ſure to get good of Him; for He hath payed the Price already, and hath given His Word for it, <hi>That ſuch as believe in him ſhall never periſh, but that he will raiſe them up at the laſt day:</hi> Ye would not think that it will be diſpleaſing, or diſſatisfying to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to the Son, that ye come to Him, and take hold of Him; for it was for that end that God ſent Him, and that He laid down His Life, and died, (but He dies no more) It will be no trouble to Him, but ſatisfaction to His Soul, for all the travel of it, to make application of His purchaſe to you; And ſeing it will not diſpleaſe, but be moſt acceptable to Him, that ye believe on Him, and be ſaved by Him, and ſince not believing rubes ſhame, in a manner up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Him, why do ye not betake your ſelves unto Him by Faith, for His ſatisfaction, and your own Salvation?</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. He not only died, but it's ſaid, <hi>He poured out his ſoul unto death,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes two things. 1. The intenſneſs of it, it was an uncouth and ſtrange Death, not only was His Body afflicted, but His Soul was poured out. 2. It looks to His good will, readineſs, and cheerfulneſſe in dying; Father, (as if He had ſaid) muſt I die? and wilt thou have my Soul ſorrowful, and heavy? I am content to be ſo, thou ſhalt have my Life, He comes not prigging to die, (to ſpeak ſo) but caſts down His bleſſed Life at His Fathers feet, and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gives it out to the uttermoſt, ſo that He will not, as it were, leave one drop of His Blood, but will needs pour and yett it out in aboundance, even all of it.</p>
            <p>Hence, <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That our bleſſed Lord Jeſus was moſt hearty in laying down His Life for Sinners, was moſt cheerful in undertaking, and moſt willing and cheerful in executing what He did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake; He makes not two Words of the bargain, (to ſpeak ſo) but when Sacrifice and Offering will not do it, as it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. Then ſayes He, <hi>Lo, I come in the volumne of the book, it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God:</hi> There is no ſtanding nor diſputing here on the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſide, but a preſent willing and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome undertaking, Therefore, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. He ſayes, <hi>Though he was continually with the father, even from everlaſting; yet his delights were with the ſons of men, rejoycing in the habitable parts of the earth:</hi> Ere ever the World was made, ere there was a Sinner in beeing to be redeemed, He rejoyced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, thinking there would be ſuch an opportunity to manifeſt His good will, grace and mercy; And if we look through the Goſpel, how often will we find this made good? <hi>No man taketh my life from me,</hi> but (ſaith He) <hi>I lay it down of my ſelf, and I take it up again:</hi> and when they came to take Him and <hi>Peter</hi> drew his ſword, he ſaid, <hi>Could not I command twelve legions of Angels; but all that is written of me muſt be fulfilled:</hi> I have bargained to lay down my Life, and it muſt be; and <hi>I have a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme to be baptized with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how am I ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed?</hi> and when it came to be accompliſhed, though He gave evidences of His power, in <hi>making them fall backward,</hi> who came to apprehend Him, yet He raiſes them again, and goes with them; And when they mock Him, and buffet Him, and nod the head at Him, and bring Him to the Bar, and queſtion Him, and when they ſaid, <hi>If thou be the king of Iſrael come down from the croſs, and we will believe on thee;</hi> which we may think He could have done, though they were but tempting Him; yet in all theſe He is ſilent, and never opens His mouth, till He come to that, <hi>It is finiſhed:</hi> He never ſpake a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyning word: It was wonderfully much to ſuffer, and to die ſo cheerfully, but to pour out His Soul unto Death, to take His Life in His own hand, and to be ſo holily prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal of it, as to pour it out, there having never been ſuch a precious Life, and ſo precious Blood poured out; this was much more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> It ſhews what eſteem ye ſhould have of Souls, and every one of you, of your own Souls: Our Lord Jeſus poured out His Soul unto Death for Souls; He values Souls ſo much, that He gave His precious Life for them: Therefore it's ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>We are not redeemed with corruptible things,
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:152256:261"/> as ſilver and gold, but with the precious blood of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> If He eſteemed ſo much of Soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, what will it be thought of when ye waſte your Souls, and ye know not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? He bought Soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> dear, and ye ſel them cheap, for a little Silver or Gold, or for that which is worſe, and far leſſe worth: what an unſuitableneſs is here betwixt Chriſts eſtimation of Souls, and yours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt His buying them at ſo dear a rate, and your caſting them away, for that which is very vanity? What do the moſt part of you get for your Souls? Some a bit Land, ſome a Houſe, ſome a feckleſſe Pleaſure, ſome a Sport, ſome the ſatisfaction of their Luſt, or a moments ſinful mirth; O! piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully poor bargain; what will become of that mirth, or luſt, or pleaſure, of this houſe, or of that land, when Kings, and great Men will lye crawling, like ſo many wormes before the Lamb? ye will not get your Houſe or Land with you, ye will not get leave to wear your brave cloathes, ye will have no Silver nor Gold in your Purſe, in that day; And ſuppoſe ye had it, the Redemption of the Soul is precious, and ceaſeth for ever by any ſuch Price: It's a wonderful thing, that when Chriſt eſteems ſo much of Souls, that Sinners ſhould eſteem ſo little of them; Is it not juſt that ſuch Souls ſhould go to hell, when they eſteemed them ſo little worth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 2. It ſhould teach you to love, and heartily to welcome this Lord Jeſus Chriſt; what argument of Love, and of Truſt, what motive to welcome Him, can there be, if this be not? That He ſpared not His Life, but poured it out unto death for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; How long ſhall we halt betwixt Chriſt and Belial? We dow not endure to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a Luſt, to want our Sport and Laughter, or a bit of our credit or honour, though it ſhould coſt us the want of Chriſt: But, O! ingrate fool, is that a becoming requital to Him, that took His innocent Soul in His hand, and poured it out for Sinners, and when it was ſome way melted, like leid in the fire of Gods Wrath, was content to yett it forth abundantly, out of love to their Salvation? Should it not rather call for love to Him, for truſting and welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Him; and to Suffering for His ſake, if He call you to it? Will ye ſkar to hazard your life for Him, that poured out His Soul for Sinners? It would do a Soul good to think how willingly, and cheerfully He Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; But, Alace! how reluctantly, and unwillingly come we under Suffering for Him? However, let me commend theſe <hi>three</hi> Words to you. 1. Love Him, <hi>For even Publicans will love theſe that love them,</hi> and give Chriſt love for love. 2. Credit and Truſt Him, do not look for ill at His hand, what ground is there to ſuſpect Him? It is His glory to do good to Sinners, and He counts them His triumph and ſpoil; and to make conqueſt of them, He poured out His Soul unto Death, or as the Word is, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>He emptied himſelf;</hi> Which ſeems to look to this Word of the Prophet, and is not that warrand ſufficient for you, to truſt and credit Him, and to lay the weight of what concerns you upon Him? And 3. welcome Him, which is a fruit of Faith and Love, He is a ſweet wooer, He is that <hi>good ſhepherd that laid down his life for his ſheep, he gave himſelf for his church,</hi> as it is, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. Therefore, I ſay, welcome Him; This is the great thing the Goſpel aims at, ſuch expreſſions are a great deepth, and it would require time to read, to ponder them, and to wonder at them; and we would be much in praying for a right uptaking of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly.

            <p>In the laſt part of the <hi>Verſe,</hi> what the Mediator is to perform, is ſet down in <hi>Four</hi> Expreſſions as paſt and done, becauſe of the certainty, &amp; efficacy of the Mediators Sufferings, and of His performing what He undertook; and of divine Juſtice, It's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation thereof. The 1. is, becauſe, <hi>He
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:152256:262"/> hath poured out his ſoul unto death;</hi> It was propoſed to the Mediator to die, which he undertook, and in the execution goes che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rfully about it; <hi>He poured out his ſoul unto death,</hi> without any prigging; grace and love (to ſpeak ſo with reverence,) were ſo liberal and prodigal of the Life of our Lord Jeſus, for the Salvation of loſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, That His bleſſed Soul was ſeparat from his Body, and he made obnoxious to the Curſe, which moſt willingly he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, his Life or Soul was poured out unto death. The 2d. is, <hi>He was numbred with the tranſgreſsours;</hi> which implyes <hi>Three</hi> things, 1. It ſuppons that he was indeed no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſour, there was no guile found in His mouth, yet he behoved to ſtoop ſo low, as to be reckoned among, or numbred with tranſgreſſours; as the former expreſſion holds out the painfulneſſe of his Death; So this holds out the ignominie of it; he not only died, and behoved to die, but he was looked on as a deſpicable perſon, even ſo deſpicable, that <hi>Barrabas</hi> a thief and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was preferred unto him; and of this we ſpake from <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>He was diſpiſed and rejected of men.</hi> 2. It implyes mens ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that when our bleſſed Lord came to redeem them, they did not count him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to live, but looked on him as a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour; This was alſo fulfilled in the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, as, <hi>John</hi> 18.30. They ſay unto <hi>Pilat, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him unto thee.</hi> 3. It implyes the low condeſcendence and depth of the love of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt which hath no bottom; he will not only die, but die a ſhamful and <hi>curſed</hi> Death, and take on reproach and ignominy with the Debt of Sinners, when they are diſpyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; The Cautioner muſt not only die, but die a ſhamful death; ſome deaths are creditable and honourable; and men will with a ſort of vanity affect them; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved not to be ſo with our Lord Jeſus; when he entered himſelf Sinners Cautioner, he muſt not only die, but be deſpicable in his death, as it is, <hi>Chap.</hi> 50.5. <hi>He gave his back to the ſmiters, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair, he hid not his face from ſhame, and ſpitting;</hi> becauſe it was ſo articled, and agreed upon; <hi>when he was reviled, he reviled not again:</hi> O! what condeſcending-love ſhins forth here, in the Mediator; It was much to pay the Debt, and die, but more in his dying to be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tranſgreſſour; much to be Caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but more to be counted the dyvour: As if ſome wicked and perverſe Officer, ceaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Cautioner, ſhould not only arreſt him for the Debt, and exact it of him; but account and call him the dyvour Debtor; yet he bears all patiently. It would learn us to bear reproach for him, he bare much more for us then we can bear for him; he was railed on, and reviled, bufferted, and ſpitted on; they, in deriſion ſaid unto him <hi>Hail king of the Jews;</hi> they mocked him, nodded the head at him; hanged him up betwixt two thieves, as the moſt eminent malefactor of the three; and <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.28. That <hi>this ſcripture was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which ſaith, and he was numbred with the tranſgreſſours;</hi> God had appointed it, and the Mediator had condeſcended to it; and therefore it behoved ſo to be; We ſpake to the matter of this before, and will not now inſiſt on it any further.</p>
            <p>The 3d. is, <hi>He bare the ſins of many;</hi> which is alſo cauſal, as the former are; It's put in here. 1. To ſhew the end of his dying, and the nature of his death; His death was a curſed death; but not for his own Sin, but for the Sins of others, even to pay the Debt, that was owing by his Elect; the <hi>many</hi> here are the ſame <hi>many</hi> ſpoken of in the former <hi>verſe who by his knowledge are juſtified,</hi> It's not the Sins of <hi>all</hi> that Chriſt bare, but the Sins of <hi>many,</hi> and the <hi>many</hi> whoſe Sins he bares are the <hi>many</hi> that are juſtified; and all who are juſtified, their Sins he bare, and of no moe; So that as many as have their Sins born by Chriſt are juſtified; and whoever are juſtified, had their Sins born by him. 2. It ſhews alſo, how the Sins of theſe <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> are taken away, It was by Chriſts bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the puniſhment due for their Sins, this it that which we ſpake to from, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all:</hi> In a word, it's this, The Mediator articleth, and agreeth to take on the guilt of the Sins of the Elect, though not their Sins, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:152256:262"/> formally conſidered; he took the deſerving, or burden of their Debt; Of this we have alſo ſpoken before, and will not therefore inſiſt any more particularly on it.</p>
            <p>The 4th. and laſt Article, or part of the condition required of the Mediator, is, <hi>He made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſours;</hi> There was more required of him then to die, and to die ſuch a death for the Elect's Sins; He muſt alſo make application of his death; and he will do that likewiſe: whereupon is founded his interceſſion, that the benefit of his death and ſatisfaction, may be applyed, and made forthcoming to them; which is ſet down in theſe Words, <hi>He made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſours;</hi> wherein alſo we are to carry along the thoughts of his condeſcending love; who not only will ſatisfie for the Elects Debt, and procure to them Righteouſneſſe and eternal Life; but when they continue in oppoſition to him, will make interceſſion for the application thereof to them, He having a number given to him, not only to pay their Debt, by dying for them, bat alſo actually to apply the benefits of his death, and purchaſe to them; according to that, <hi>John</hi> 6.39. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that of all that he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but raiſe them up at the laſt day:</hi> Theſe <hi>Four</hi> do plainly, and ſummarly comprehend the Mediators ingagment in the Covenant of Redemption, as to his prieſtly Office; and having ſpoken ſomewhat to the firſt three; we ſhall inſiſt a little on this laſt, concerning his <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For clearing whereof; when he prayed on the Croſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do:</hi> this was in part fulfilled; But his Praying, or making Interceſſion for tranſgreſſours, is to be conſidered <hi>Two</hi> wayes, 1. As he was a man under the Law, and ſo he was to pray for other tranſgreſſours, then the Elect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: as <hi>Stephen</hi> following his example did, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.60. When he ſaid, <hi>Lord lay not this ſin to their charge:</hi> 2. As he is Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and ſo he prayes only for the Elect: as is clear, <hi>John</hi> 17.9. And his Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thus conſidered is alwayes effectual, and runs in the channel of the Covenant of Redemption, and is commenſurable, and of equal extent with his Death; His Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in the <hi>First</hi> ſenſe is more largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, he might, conſidered as man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, have interceeded for his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, that were not Elected; Therefore we take his Interceſſion here in the <hi>Second</hi> ſenſe, as he is Mediator: and as <hi>Matthew, chap.</hi> 8.17. applyes his bearing of our griefs, and carrying of our ſorrows ſpoken of, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. of this, <hi>chap.</hi> To his carrying of our temporal bodily infirmities: So there may be an alluſion to this, in the Lords Prayer on the Croſs: We mark this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, becauſe <hi>Arminians,</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to an univerſal Redemption, plead alſo for an univerſal Interceſſion: and on this ground they ſay that Chriſt prayed for many that went to hell: But we anſwer, that our bleſſed Lord Jeſus did not there, if he prayed for any ſuch, interceed as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator properly, but as man under the Law; even as in his prayer in the Garden, when his holy humane nature ſinleſly ſkarred at the bitter cup, He prayed, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible let this cup depart from me;</hi> and it was agreeable to the humane nature to ſeek innocently to eſchew the drinking of ſuch a cup; But, when in the ſame Prayer, he ſpeaks as Mediator: He ſayes, <hi>not my will but thy will be done: And for this cauſe came I into this hour;</hi> So when he preached as man, and a Miniſter of the circumciſion, he ſayes, <hi>O! Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten would I have gathered thee, and thou wouldeſt not:</hi> Whereas, if we conſider him as Mediator he doth what he will; and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth none but they come, and calleth none to be gathered, but ſuch as are gathered: The Interceſſion here meaned is that, which is an Article of the Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aed a piece of Chriſts Prieſtly Office, To which the promiſe in the firſt part of the <hi>Verſe</hi> is made; and therefore we have here clear acceſſe to ſpeak of it according as the new Teſtament holds it out to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then we <hi>Obſerve</hi> this <hi>Doctrine</hi> from it, That according to the Covenant of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, our Lord muſt nor only die, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo interceed for tranſgreſſours, or ſinners;
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:152256:263"/> or, it is a part of our Lords Office agreed upon, in the Covenant of Redemption, that he ſhould be Interceſſour for tranſgreſſours; It's on this ground, that it's ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.4. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn, and will not repent; thou art a Prieſt for ever, after the order of Melchiſedeck;</hi> He is <hi>a Prieſt</hi> a ter <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck's</hi> order, and not after the order of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raon,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. He is ſaid to be <hi>at the right hand of God, making interceſſion for us:</hi> It is ſaid likewiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. That <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermost all that come to God by him: Seeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them:</hi> So, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. It's ſaid, <hi>If any man ſin we have an advocat with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous:</hi> and frequently elſe where, it's in Scripture attributed to him: If it be aſked, why be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour? we anſwer, for theſe <hi>Three</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, 1. It was ſuitable to the glory of God, that the great Lord Deputy appointed for the ingathering of Elect Sinners ſhould be furniſhed with this Office; and his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is derived from it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, ſeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for us:</hi> He cannot ſit up, nor fall in proving himſelf to be an able Saviour, becauſe he lives for ever to interceed. 2. It's ſuitable and meet for the glory of the Mediator, and of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that he ſhould not be a Prieſt for a time only, but for ever; Therefore, when he is brought in as a Prieſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. He is preferred to the order of <hi>Araon,</hi> and ſaid <hi>to be a Prieſt for ever, after the order of Melchiſedeck; by ſo much as he is ſurety of a better Testament: They were many, becauſe they were not ſuffered to continue; But this man, becauſe he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for ever, hath an unchangeable prieſt-hood.</hi> 3. It was meet, in reſpect of the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Believers in him have from this his Interceſſion; there had been a defect in the conſolation of Believers, if he had not been Interceſſour; but ſeing, as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. <hi>We have ſuch an high Priest over the houſe of God, we have boldneſs to enter into the holieſt, by a new and living way</hi> and may <hi>draw near with full aſsurance of faith,</hi> And that which gives us this bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is that (as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15.16.) <hi>We have not an high Prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are:</hi> Then follows, <hi>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of geace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</hi> 4. We may add, That it's ſuitable for this reaſon, to wit, if we conſider, and compare the Type with the Anti-type, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.10. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. compared with, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. The high Prieſt had Sacrifices preſcribed to him for himſelf and for the people, when he went once in the year, into the moſt holy with the blood of the Sacrifice, which ſignified, that Chriſt after the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of his Life, <hi>was to enter into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there to appear in the preſence of God for us, Heb.</hi> 9.24.</p>
            <p>This is a point which may yeeld us many and great <hi>Uſes,</hi> as 1. For <hi>Information,</hi> to clear us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bout Chriſt's Interceſſion. 2. For <hi>Conſolation;</hi> To ſhew us the advantages that flow to Believers from it. 3. For <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in dutie, to learn us what uſe we ſhould make of it. And 4. For <hi>Reproof</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi> for, and of the Sin of our much ſlighting, and neglecting this part of Chriſts Prieſtly Office.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Firſt,</hi> It ſerves, we ſay, for <hi>Information;</hi> and to let us ſee that we have an excellent high Prieſt, who is not only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Type, in dying, but alſo in interceeding, who died, that he might make application of what he purchaſed by his death.</p>
            <p>For further clearing, and proſecuting of this <hi>Uſe,</hi> we ſhall ſpeak a little to ſome few queſtions, As 1. What this Interceſſion is? 2 Who Interceeds? 3. For whom? 4. For what? 5. How this Interceſſion is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed? 6. What are the grounds on which it is founded?</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt.</hi> What this Interceſſion is in general? and for clearing it, ye would conſider what it is not; and, 1. There is here no humbling of the Mediator in way of Supplication, as he prayed when on earth; or as we pray, or as one man intreats, or interceeds with another; That way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceeding is inconſiſtent with his exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:152256:263"/> his humiliation being perfected and by, and he being now exalted at the right hand of God. 2. It's no verbal thing, no bringing forth, or uttering of Words; There is no ſuch language in our Lords Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and ſo we are not to conceive of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, as if he made a formal prayer: That manner of dealling, or proceeding is not now betwixt God and the Mediator. 3. Neither doth this his Interceſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in any new particular act of his will, as if he did act, or will ſomething that he did not before; therefore he is ſaid to <hi>Live for ever, to make interceſſion, and to abide a Prieſt continually:</hi> His Interceſſion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, as is clear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.3, 25. His being in Heaven, and appearing there in our name, is his Interceſſion: And therefore, 2. Let us ſee in the next place, what i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; and in the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and analogie whence it's borrowed; for it's a borrowed thing; as the Covenant of Redemption is, from compacts among men, becauſe we cannot take up divine, and miſterious things, except they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt after the manner of men for our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity: Such is this, as if a Kings Son were interpoſing for a perſon not in good terms with the King, or, for whom he would have ſome benefit from the King his Father; The ſimilitude ſeems indeed to be drawn from this, yet it muſt not be aſtricted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: Therefore, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. He is called <hi>an advocat with the Father;</hi> and yet he doth not advocat our cauſe verbally as we ſaid before; And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and man:</hi> Where the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of praying; And here he is ſaid to make Interceſſion for us, as the high Prieſt did in name of the People; in a word, it is our Lords Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2dly. Who makes Interceſſion? It is not enough that Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as man makes Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but it is Chriſt Mediator, God and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n in one Perſon: It being an error of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to make the Interceſſion of Chriſt, to be a thing performed by the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only, which leſſeneth the conſolation of Believers, and is inconſiſtent with the Union of the two natures, and detracts from the weig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t that his God-head gives to his Interceſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. For whom does he interceed? There are here extreams on both hands to be eſhewed. 1. Some make his Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over broad; as if he interceeded for all the World; this he expreſly denyes, <hi>John</hi> 17.9. <hi>I pray not for the world:</hi> and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion being grounded on his death, and ſatisfaction, it muſt be of equal extent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and muſt relate to the Covenant of Redemption; wherein ſo many were given him to be redeemed by his death. 2. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers make his Interceſſion too na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>row, in making it only for them that actua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; He alſo refuts this opinion, <hi>John</hi> 17.20. By ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for all that ſhall believe on me through their word.</hi> And it is alwayes on this ground that he interceeds, to wit, becauſe <hi>they are given;</hi> So that it's for the Elect converted, or unconverted, that he interceeds; The reaſon why we mark this, is, to overturn thereby <hi>Two</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt diſtinctions, that are made uſe of, to bring in an univerſal Interceſſion, as well as an univerſal Redemption. 1. Some make
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:152256:264"/> his Interceſſion common to all; but we, according to the Scripture, acknowledge no ſuch Interceſſion to belong to Chriſt, eſpecially as Mediator; however he might, as man, under the Law, have prayed for ſome that ſhall not be actually ſaved, as he commands one man to pray for other men, yet not for all men ſimply. 2. Others make a conditional Interceſſion for all, as they make a conditional Redemption of all; and make both abſolute for Believers only, which is alſo corrupt; For conſidering the object of his Interceſſion as Mediator to be only the Elect, as indeed they are; it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns both this, and the former opinion; if he prayed not for all, he died not for all: the one whereof is grounded on the other.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly. For what doth he interceed? In general, for all that is conditioned to him, in the Covenant for the behove of his people; He prayes for the fulfilling of all the Articles of the Covenant, as, that all the Elect, who are not regenerat, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generat, and made Believers; That many through his knowledge, may be juſtified; That theſe that are regenerat, and Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and by Faith have be taken themſelves to him, may be juſtified, pardoned, and received in favour; friendſhip and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God; that Believers may be keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from tentation, that tentations may be prevented, and they made to perſever; That Satan may not make their Faith to fail them, as he deſigns, and the Lord gives account of his deſign, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. <hi>Satan hath ſought to winnow you, but I have prayed that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> faith fail not:</hi> That they, and their prayers and ſervice may be accepted; that the ſuits and ſupplications that they preſent, and put up in his name may get a hearing; That they may be armed againſt the fear of death: That they may be carried on in the gradual advances of Sanctification to the end of their Faith, the ſalvation of their Souls; that they may be glorified, and be where he is, to behold his glory; In a Word, he interceeds for every thing needful, and for every thing promiſed to them; his Interceſſion being as broad as his Purchaſe:</p>
            <p n="5">5ly. How doth he perform this part of his Prieſtly Office for his People? it's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by his entrie into the moſt holy place, in our nature and name, as having ſatisfied Juſtice, and vanquiſhed death, where he appears before God for us; So that we are to look to Chriſt's being in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not ſimply as glorifying himſelf or as glorified in himſelf, for himſelf; but as our head, and forerunner, to anſwer all that can be ſaid againſt his Elect, for whom he ſuffered, and ſatisfied; as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.23, 24. <hi>It was therefore neceſſary that the patterns of things in the heavens ſhould be purified with theſe, but the heavenly things themſelves with better ſacrifices; for Christ is not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true, but into heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us;</hi> So that our Lord Jeſus by his entry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven doth declare (I mean materially declare) his victory in our name, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears there, as a publick, and not as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat perſon; His entry into heaven is not to be looked on, as the entry of <hi>Moſes</hi> or of <hi>Elias,</hi> but as the entry of him who is head of the Elect, whoſe entry there is a Declaration of what he would be at; As by the power of his God-head, he conveyed himſelf in thither; So he hath taken poſſeſsion in our name, and according to the Covenant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that theſe whoſe room he ſuſtains, may and muſt be admitted to glory; And we muſt conceive an ſpecial efficacy in his being there, for procuring to them what he hath purchaſed. 2. His Interceſsion is performed through the efficacy of his blood and ſatisfaction flowing from the nature of the Covenant; which hath a moral real cry, for making effectual, what he by his death hath procured; As the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Abels</hi> Blood, and of making appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Chriſts Blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. Saith, <hi>It ſpeaketh better things then the blood of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;</hi> For <hi>Abels</hi> Blood had a dmereit in it to cry guilt, and could not but have a Curſe following it, becauſe God had curſed the ſhedder of Blood; But Chriſts Blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as the price of Redemption for the Elect; hath an invaluable and unconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able merit, and worth in it, and muſt have
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:152256:264"/> a cry for the bleſſings purchaſed to them by it. 3. He performs this his Interceſſion by his conſtant care, and by his continual willingneſſe, and actual willing, that what he hath purchaſed for his Elect people may be applyed to them; that ſuch and ſuch perſons may be brought to believe, that upon their believing they may be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; delivered from ſnares and tentations; keeped in favour with God; may be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their performances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For he had that prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17.20.24. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to have that ſame Sympathy; His way on earth was alwayes ſinleſs, but now is glorious and majeſtick, ſuited to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified ſtate; He continues to interceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he intended; and his actual wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs is a main part of his Interceſsion, which is not in renewing of acts (to ſpeak ſo;) but in his continuing deſire, &amp; willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that what good he hath purchaſed, may be conferred according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; For Chriſt in heaven is ſtill a true man, and hath a will, as he had on earth, continuing to ſeek that they may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with him, for whom he ſatisfied; and this actual willing deſiring, and affecting, that ſuch a thing ſhould be; is called his Interceſsion; becauſe it cannot but be ſo eſteemed, as to have the effect to follow, according to the Covenant, as he ſayes, <hi>John</hi> 11.41, 42. <hi>I thank thee Father, that thou haſt heard me, and I know that thou heareſt me alwayes:</hi> This as to his actual wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, cannot but be in heaven: However, we are ſure that he is there, and in our name; and that his death, and blood ſhed hath an efficacy, to bring about what he hath purchaſed; and that his will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection are the ſame, and have an efficacy with them, and the effect certainly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo as nothing can go wrong there, more then the man that hath a juſt cauſe in a Court of Judicature, and an able Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat, with much moyen, to agent and plead it before a Juſt Judge, can be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or loſs his Cauſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6ly. The grounds of his Interceſsion are, 1. The excellency of his perſon, who, though he be man, yet is he God alſo, <hi>equal with the Father; the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding all things by the word of his powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> As it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. Which cannot but add weight to his Interceſsion, as well as to his Satisfaction; the Perſon that interceeds being God. The 2. is his Satisfaction; which is the ground of his Interceſsion; for upon his Satisfaction he maketh Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; even as if a Cautioner would ſay, I have payed ſuch a mans Debt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ought to be abſolved; Therefore 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1, 2. Theſe two are joyned, <hi>We have an advocat with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous:</hi> and, <hi>he is the propitiation for our ſins:</hi> So, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. They are joyned, <hi>It's Chriſt that died, who is at the right hand of God, and maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> 3. The Covenant of Redemption is the great ground on which his Interceſsion is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Such and ſuch perſons are given to Chriſt, and ſuch priviledges, and benefits offered to be conferred upon them, on condition the Mediator would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and ſatisfie for them; and he having undertaken, and payed the price; there is good ground for his interceeding, for the making application of the purchaſe; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſayes, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me,</hi> &amp;c. This gives him right to plead, and interceed for them; ſeing he hath endured Soul-travel for them, he ought to ſee his Seed, and to have many Juſtified, and fred from the curſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation that they were obnoxious to; as the fruit of that ſore Soul-travel.</p>
            <p>In, and from the conſideration of theſe; we may gather what is the nature of Chriſts Interceſſion, and how we may make uſe of it: And how particularly we ſhould beware of a carnal miſtake in many about his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; as if he were praying in heaven, as a diſtinct partie from God; It's true, he is a diſtinct Perſon of the glorious Trinity, but not a diſtinct Partie in interceeding, as ſome ignorantly conceive of him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think him eaſier to have acceſs to then the Father; and therefore will pray him to pray the Father for them; as if, when they prayed to him, they were not praying to the Father; or as if there were not on object of Worſhip; This flows from
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:152256:265"/> ignorance of the nature of Chriſts Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In proſecuting this <hi>Uſe,</hi> we anſwered ſome <hi>Questions,</hi> which now we ſhall not inſiſt to repeat: Only there is a ſhort <hi>Queſtion</hi> or two, that further may be aſked (which wil clear the former ere we go to the next <hi>Uſe,</hi> And the 1. is, if our Lord before he came in the fleſh, diſcharged this part of his prieſtly Office? The reaſon of the queſtion or doubt is, becauſe in the new Teſtament his interceſsion is alwayes, at leaſt very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, ſubjoyned to his Aſcenſion. The 2d. is, How his Interceſsion now difers from his Interceſſion before his Incarnation, or in what reſpects the conſolation of Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that flows from his interceſſion is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er now, then the conſolation of Believer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there from was before he was Incarnat? As for the <hi>Firſt,</hi> It cannot be denyed, but Chriſt was Interceſſour ſince he had a Church in the World, for it's a part of his prieſtly Office, and he was made a Prieſt, by the eternal oath, in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.4. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever:</hi> And hels ſaid to have <hi>an unchangable Priesthood;</hi> And there being but one way of acceſs for Sinners to Heaven, by Chriſt, who is called <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world;</hi> it muſt be holden for a ſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that his Interceſſion is as old as his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>crifice; And he was interceſſour before his Incarnation in theſe three reſpects. 1. In reſpect of his Office, being deſigned to be Interceſſour; For (as we ſaid) being deſigned to be Prieſt, and being Mediator before his Incarnation, he behoved to be Interceſſour alſo: For that way he did Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat, and the benefits that came to Sinners from the beginning, were the effects of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion: Therefore 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5 It's ſaid, <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and there was never another real Mediator, however <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> might be called a typical one. 2. He was Interceſſour before his Incarnation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the merit of his future Sacrifice: He did not before his Incarnation Interceed by vertue of his Sacrifice actually offered, as now he doth yet there was vertue which flowed from his Sacrifice to be offered, to the people of God, as well then as now, when it hath been long ſince offered: The Sins of all that ever were pardoned, were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned on the account of his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s after it, in reſpect of the effects that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed on it, to the People of God, then and now: The People of God before his Incarnation had communion with God, and acceſs to him; though not generally, in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As to the 2d. How his Mediation, and Interceſſion now differs ſince his aſcenſion, from his Interceſſion before it, as to the ſtrengthening of the conſolation of the people of God? For anſwer, 1. We lay down this for a concluſion; That though our Lord Jeſus was Mediator both before his Incarnation, and now, yet ſince his aſcenſion, he hath a new way of Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Interceſſion, that exceedingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds to the ſtrengthening of the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his People: therefore it's ordinarly ſubjoyned to his aſcenſion, becauſe of his new manner of diſcharging that his Office; It is time, there is no addition to that grace which is infinit in him, as if he could be more gracious, or as if, in reſpect of the Covenant, there could be larger promiſes, as to eſſential things contained therein; but by taking on our nature, he hath a new way of being affected, and a new way of venting his affection to us; and is capable of another manner of touch with the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his people now, that he hath humane bowels, though glorified, and glorious; and the Faith of his People hath a ground ſuper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dded, whereupon to expect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of that grace, mercy, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is in him; though all the effects that followed to his people, before his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, had reſpect to his future Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; So theſe effects had reſpect to his future Interceſſion, in our nature, as well as to his dying, and laying down of the price; for theſe that were admitted to heaven ere he came in the Fleſh, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſame way that we are.</p>
            <p>But, 2dly, and more particularly, if it be aſked wherein this addition to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of God's People, by his Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after his Aſcenſion kythes, or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts it ſelf? We may take it up in theſe <hi>Six</hi> ſteps, which will alſo ſerve to illuſtrat the manner of his interceeding. 1. It kythes in this, That he appeareth in heaven in our nature; now the man Chriſt is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven interceeding, and as Advocat, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for purſued Sinners, or as Ambaſſador, and Legat agenting the affairs of them that are given to him of the Father, as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>He is not entered into the holy places made with hands, but into heaven it ſelf, to appear now in the preſence of God for us:</hi> Where the Apoſtle having been ſpeaking of the excellency of his Prieſt-hood before; and comparing him with the Type; he tels that he is not entered into the typical taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, but into heaven it ſelf, to appear there in the preſence of God for us; And this is a ſolid ground of conſolation to a poor believing Sinner, that he hath Chriſt in his own nature in heaven, interceeding, that what he performed before, by vertue of his Office and of the efficacy of his Sacrifice, to be offered, when he ſhould be incarnat; He now being incarnat, and aſcended per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms it; we having God in our nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a man like unto us; to care for the things of his people; and if any new queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ariſe, or debate be ſtarted, to entertain the treaty, and to effectuat, and make out their buſineſſe, that nothing that concerns them miſgive. 2. Their conſolation is ſtronger in this reſpect, That he is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by vertue of the efficacy of his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice already offered; As the High Prieſt, when he had offered the Sacrifice, took the blood with him within the vall, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceeded for the people: So our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is not now interceeding by vertue of his
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:152256:266"/> Sacrifice to be offered, but by vertue of his Sacrifice already offered; having entered into heaven, and taken the efficacy of his Sacrifice with him, to enter it (to ſpeak ſo) in the book of God, to ſtand on record; nay he ſtandeth there himſelf, to keep the memory of his blood freſh; and by each appearance of him there, who is never out of the ſight of the Majeſty of God; there is ſtill a repreſentation of the worth and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his Sacrifice, and for whom, and for what it was offered. 3. There is by the man Chriſt his being in heaven, this ground of conſolation ſupperadded, That he hath a ſympathie with Sinners, otherwayes then before, not as to the degree, nor as to the intenſneſs of his grace and mercy, (as I hinted before) but as to the manner how he is affected; ſo he hath the true nature, and ſinleſs affection of a man; and ſo hath bowels to be wrought upon, which kythed while he was on earth; although we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take up the manner how he is touched, yet he is touched otherwayes then God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractly conſidered can be: and otherways then an angel in heaven can be touched: as we may ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. and 4.15. <hi>We have not an high prieſt, which cannot be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all things tempted as we are, yet without ſin:</hi> And it behoved him to be like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful, and faithful High Prieſt, and have compaſſion on the ignorant, and them that are out of the way: He is Sinners friend, that is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour; and ſuch an Interceſſour, that interceeds from the impreſſion that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and inconceivable ſympathie which he hath with his members, hath upon him; as his expreſſion to <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks forth, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. <hi>Saul, Saul why perſecuts thou me,</hi> counting himſelf a ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rer with his people, which cannot but have it's own influence on his Interceſſion, and add to the conſolation of his People; that what he interceeds for the procurement of to them; is ſome way on this ground, as being a favour to their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified head. 4. Beſide this ſympathy he hath a longing (to ſpeak ſo) to have all the wants and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fects of his people ſupplied, and made up; and to have all the promiſes made to him, in behalf of the Elect fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: Not any ſuch longing, as may in the leaſt incroach on, or be inconſiſtent with the glory, and glorified ſtate of our bleſſed Lord Jeſus; but conſidering, that there is a near relation betwixt him and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowrs, he being the head, and they the members, and that he hath a ſympathy and affection according to that relation: It is anſwerable, and ſuitable that he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and ſome way long for the perfyting of his body the Church, which <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. is called <hi>The fulneſſe of him who filleth all in all;</hi> And he hath no queſtion, though a moſt pure and regular, yet a moſt kindly and ſtrong deſire, and longing to have his Body perfyted, to have the Elect gathered and brought in: As he had on earth a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have the work finiſhed, which was given him to do: And this cannot but be a weighty part of his Interceſſion, and very comfortable to his people; his longing to have ſuch and ſuch a perſon converted, ſuch and ſuch a perſon more mortified, and more perfyted, and made more confirm to him: There is a word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.13. that gives ground for this, <hi>From henceforth expecting till all his enemies be made his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool:</hi> And what is ſpoken of this <hi>expecting</hi> of what is there mentioned, may be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to other things; He is ſure expecting till all theſe promiſes concerning his ſeeing of a Seed, and the juſtifying and glorifying of many be fulfilled; becauſe that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him in the former <hi>verſe:</hi> and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till he divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong, as is promiſed in the former part of this <hi>verſe;</hi> Now our Lord Jeſus having laid down his Life, what is he doing in heaven? even longing till theſe promiſes be fulfilled; Not that he hath any longing that implyes a defect in him ſimply; for he is abſoutly glorified, and gloriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; yet ſuch longing as is conſiſtent with his glorified ſtate, as (if we may make the compariſon, though in every thing it be not ſuitable) the Souls in heaven are perfytly glorified, yet they have a longing for the union of their bodies, for the perfyting of Chriſts body myſtical, and for the union of all the members in a Soul and Body with the head; So Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:152256:267"/> as Mediator, God-man in heaven hath a longing and holy deſire which agrees with his Office, and is a qualification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and doth no ways interrupt his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that what concerns his Elect may be perfyted; Therefore it's ſaid in the <hi>verſe</hi> before, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied:</hi> importing that it's a kind of new ſatisfaction to him, to get a Sinner brought in to believe in him, and that he was waiting and longing for it. 5. He hath an actual willing, and continuing deſire, that what he hath purchaſed to ſuch and ſuch perſons may be applyed: And this is not ſimply to will, for he had that on earth but a declaring of it in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that ſuch and ſuch things may be forth coming, and made effectual for the behove of his members, that what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, in laying down his life, may be brought to paſs: It's the Mediator God-man willing; whoſe will, as man, being perfytely conform to the will of God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be (to ſpeak ſo) gainſaid in whatſoever he willeth for the perſons given him, and this is anſwerable to that, <hi>John</hi> 17.24. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will that theſe whom thou hast given me, may be with me, where I am,</hi> &amp;c. I will that ſuch and ſuch things ingaged to me for them may be made good, That ſuch and ſuch perſons be pardoned and brought through, that they may be preſerved from tentation, may have their prayers heard, that they may be made to perſevere, and may be glorified; So that we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a caſe wherein Gods People have need, and a promiſe in the Covenant, but there is an actual willingneſs in Chriſt to have the need ſuppl ed, and the promiſe applyed, according to the terms of the Covenant. 6. We may take in here, not only Chriſts wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that ſuch a thing be done, but his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual doing of it; And as this is a piece of his Interceſſion, ſo it holds him forth to be a notable. Interceſſour; compare <hi>John</hi> 14.13.16.26. &amp; 15.26 &amp; 67. In the 14. <hi>Chap. verſe</hi> 13. he ſayes, <hi>Whatſoever ye ask in my name I will do;</hi> which we ſuppoſe reſpects Chriſt as Mediator, to be truſted as great Lo d D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>puty in our nature, to anſwer the prayers of his People, when put up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God: The 16. <hi>Chap. verſe</hi> 26. Speaks of the Fathers ſending the Comforter, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.26. Of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators ſending the Comforter, So doth <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.7. In one place it is, <hi>What ye ask I will do,</hi> and in another place it is, that <hi>the Father will do;</hi> It's all one, but it is to ſhew, that what the Father doth, he wil do it by the Son the Mediator, and he wil actually perform it; And theſe three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, <hi>I will pray the Father, And I wil ſend,</hi> and <hi>the Father ſhall ſend,</hi> hold out this, That as the Father doth by the Son, ſo that this is a part of Chriſts interceſſion, effectually to procure and ſend out to us, what we have need of. 7. In all this there is in the Men Chriſt, an adoration of the Father, which, though it be not ſuch as is unſuitable to his exalted and glorified ſtate, yet is it becoming well him that is Man, and in that reſpect, is at his right hand, to give to God: I ſhall only ſay further here, that though we cannot tell how he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to ſatisfie our ſelves fully, yet this is clearly held forth to us, that whatſoever is needful, by his being in heaven we may confidently expect it will be performed from the man Chriſt, from him who is God-man in one Perſon; and ſo his Interceſſion with the Father is his actual procuring, and doing ſuch a thing, and that not as God ſimply, but as Mediator; Therefore theſe two words are put in the forecited expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>Whatſoever ye ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son, and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 2. To ſhew the notable conſolatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that flows from this part of Chriſts Office: O! What ſavourineſſe, and unſearchable riches are in this part of his name? That our Lord Jeſus, as Interceſſour, appeares in
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:152256:267"/> the preſence of God for us; We ſhall ſpeak here to theſe <hi>Five</hi> things. 1. Wherein this is comfortable, or to the extent of it. 2. To the advantages that follow on it. 3. To the grounds of this conſolation which are confirmations of it. 4. To this, at what times, and particular occaſions the People of God may, and ought in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to make uſe of, and comfort themſelves in it: And 5. on what terms this conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is allowed, that they grow not vain, and proud of it.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> Our Lords Interceſſion gives a <hi>Fourfold</hi> extent of conſolation, that makes it wonderful. 1. In it's univerſality, as to the perſons to whom it's extended; Not indeed to all men in the World, but to all that will make uſe of it; And though it were ſimply of univerſal extent to all men in the world, yet it would comfort none, but ſuch as made uſe of it: And that vanity of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> that extends Chriſts Death, and Interceſſion to all can truly ſay no more for ſo in comfort; for they are forced to ſay that Chriſt died, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his death for many that will never get good of him, but we ſay all that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhould get good of his death, do get the intended good of it; yea, we ſay, that whoever will make uſe of him, ſhall get good both of his Death, and of his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; So, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come unto God through him;</hi> Though the cauſe ſeemed to be deſperat, and the ſentence pronounced; <hi>Curſed is he that continues not in all things written in the law,</hi> yet he is able to ſave them, Therefore, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. It's ſaid, <hi>If any man ſin:</hi> O! ſtrange word, <hi>We have an Advocat,</hi> what, an Advocat for <hi>any</hi> man? yea, for any man that will make uſe of him: For as we ſhew before, though it's true that his Interceſſion is bounded to his Elect, yet it's as true, that he refuſes no cauſe that is honeſtly given him to plead; <hi>If any man ſin, we have an advocat:</hi> He will not ſay to ſuch poor Souls, I will not be for you, I have done all that I may, but it is gone againſt me; neither will he prig (to ſay ſo) with you, he will not ſay, I will have this or that ere I undertake your cauſe for you; but <hi>if any man ſin,</hi> If any man ſee his need, and will imploy him; whether he be a great man, or mean man, whether he be poor or rich, bound or free; whether he be an old ſinner that his lived long in ſecurity, hypocriſie or prophanity, or be a ſitten up profeſſour, whether he be young or old; If any of you all that are here will come to him, he will not refuſe to be imployed by you: <hi>By him therefore</hi> (as the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel runs on an univerſality, and excludes none, but theſe, that by their unbelief, exclude themſelves: So his Interceſſion runs on an univerſality, If any man ſin, and will imploy him he is an Advocat at hand: And ſeing it is Chriſt, and Chriſt as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour for tranſgreſſours, that we are ſpeaking of, as the ground of Sinners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; let me in paſſing deſire you to remember, that he is pointing at you, men and women; and if there be any of you, that have a broken cauſe to plead, any debt that ye would fain be fred of, any Sin to be pardoned, or your peace to be made with God; here is an Advocat, and the very beſt, offering himſelf to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed: Such an Advocat, as ſaid <hi>John</hi> 11. <hi>I thank thee Father, for that I know thou hearest me alwayes:</hi> This was true while he was on earth, and will be true to the end of the world. 2. The extent of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation appears in reſpect of all caſes, as his Interceſſion ſecluds no perſon, that wil make uſe of him, ſo it ſecluds no caſe, though it looked like a loſt cauſe, and though the conſcience had pronunced the Sentence, God is greater then the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and can louſe from it, though the Act were paſt in the Law; he can cancel it: And here comes in the triumph, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is God that juſtifies;</hi> Will the Devil, the Law, the Conſcience, or any thing lay ought to the charge of the man whom God juſtifies? No, why ſo? <hi>It is Chriſt that died:</hi> But that is not all, alas! may the Soul ſay, How will I get good of
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:152256:268"/> Chriſts death? I cannot apply it, and make uſe of it, He anſwers that; <hi>He is alſo riſen again, and ſitten down at the right hand of God, and there maketh interceſſion for us;</hi> to wit, that his purchaſe may be applyed, and there needs no more, ye will get no more, ye can ſeek no more, and that cloſes the triumph. There is no ſin before, nor after Converſion, no ſin of ignorance, no ſin againſt light, no enemy, no tentation, whatever it be, but that word anſwers all; <hi>Who can lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect?</hi> Where Chriſt takes the ſinners caſe in hand, who will ſtand up againſt him, he is too ſtrong a partie; If Satan ſtand at the High Prieſts hand, it's the Lord that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes him; <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. That as it were boaſts him from the bar. 3. The extent of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation appears, in reſpect of the degree, and hight of the perfection of the Salvation that comes by Chriſts Interceſſion, to all that make uſe of him in all caſes: <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermost:</hi> The word is very ſignificant, he is able to ſave perfectly, to perfection, and to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the hight of perfection; and what more would ye be at? He can ſave from corruption, and put without the reach of it; He can ſave from wrath, that it ſhall not come near you, He can ſave from all the effects of ſin and wrath; He ſhall not leave a tear on the cheek of any of his own ere all be done; and that is the ground of it, <hi>For he lives for ever, to make interceſſion for us:</hi> If any ſhould ſay, he may ſave from one ſin, but not from another, or he may bring me a piece of the way to heaven, and then leave me there; It's folly ſayes the Apoſtle, to think to; <hi>For he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, becauſe he lives for ever to make interceſſion:</hi> Although his death ſeem to be tranſient, once for all perfyted, yet that cannot mar the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the benefits purchaſed by it; For he is Interceſſour; and he that procured thy entring in the way, will carry the on in it; he that procured a ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tified convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to come in, will through it; h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that procured thy juſtification, and pardon of ſin, will alſo apply it to thy conſcience, and bring forth an intimation of it, when he thinks fit, and ſanctifie thee throughly; and this is indeed great conſolation to a ſinner, that he who hath begun the work will perfyt it, and he will not leave it, till it be at ſuch a hight of perfection, as it can be deſired to be no higher. 4. The extent of this conſolation is ſuch, that it reacheth to all times: There it is not a Believer in any place or caſe, that is wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with any difficulty, that can come wrong to Chriſt: He is ever in readineſſe to be employed: There is never an hour nor moment that he hath his door ſhu, He died once, but now lives for ever, to die no more, and he lives for ever to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, he is entred into immortality, to make effectual, what he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in favours of his people; He is always at the Bar; and when his own are but little imploying him, he is minding their affairs night and day, watching over them every moment: See <hi>Luke</hi> 22. where the Lord ſayeth, <hi>Peter, ſatan hath ſought to winnow you, but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not:</hi> Satan gave in a Bill againſt <hi>Peter,</hi> when he had no mind of it, but the Lord repelled it, The greateſt cheat, or the moſt ſubtile adverſary, that ſteals out Decreets cannot circumveen him, He is ſtill waiting on at the Ear, that nothing come in againſt his people to their prejudice; and if it do come in it's that he may cruſhit in the firſt motion: O! how doth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of Believers ſtream out here? <hi>He will not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his voice to be heard on high; a bruiſed reed will he not break, and the ſmoaking flax will be not quench, untill he bring forth judgement unto truth:</hi> He will not contend, nor ſay, man or woman, how is this, that thou haſt put thy ſelf in the myre, and would have me to take thee out of it, that thou brings a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Plea to me, and ſeeks of me to right it? He will not aſk whether ye have money, all his imployment is free; nor will he put you back till the morrow, nor bid you wait on till another time, morning and evening, and at midnight he is ready; and when the Elect Sinner hath little thought, He is watching over his need preventing many tentations, keeping from many ill turns,
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:152256:268"/> caſting many challenges over the Bar, that the Devil, and the Law put in: Therefore ſtudy his Offices more, and this among the reſt, we much wrong him, in not ſtudying of them, and acquainting our ſelves with them, that we may feed upon them; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf open up his name to us, and to him be praiſe.</p>

            <p>O! That Sinners were ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidering how much they are obliged to Chriſt; He hath in the former words <hi>Poured out his ſoul unto death,</hi> for Sinners, and was wounded for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours, and yet that was not all, though Sin was our Lords death, he hath not caſten out with Sinners, but having gotten the Victory over all enemies, and ſitten down at the right hand of God; <hi>He makes interceſſion,</hi> and to make it the more full; It's ſaid, <hi>He makes interceſſion for tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours:</hi> All his Offices have an eye to Sin, and Sinners, and this part of his Office among others.</p>
            <p>We began to ſpeak of an <hi>Uſe</hi> of comfort that flows from this; and truly, if any Doctrine be comfortable this is; That Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have an Advocat with the Father; what would Sinners do, when their peace is broken, &amp; there is a door ſhut betwixt God and them, and his back is turned on them, and the Conciſence is wakened, and they cannot think on God but it's troubleſome to them, if they had not a friend in Court, with whom the Father cannot but be well pleaſed?</p>
            <p>This Conſolation being a main part of the uſe of this Doctrine, and the ground of Believers boldneſſe with God: In the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of it forth, we propoſed <hi>Five</hi> things to be ſpoken to. 1. To ſhew the largeneſs and extent of the conſolation that flows from this ground, and of this we ſpake. 2. The particular advantages that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture attributs to Chriſt's Interceſſion, and the conſolation that is in them. 3. The particular times, when eſpecially Believers are called to make uſe of this conſolation. 4. Some grounds warranding them to make uſe of it. and 5. Some caveats, or adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements to them that would warrantably comfort themſelves from it.</p>
            <p>To proceed now, and to ſpeak to theſe laſt <hi>Four</hi> things. 1. The particular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that the Scriptures attribut to Chriſts Interceſſion, and if we look through them, we will find that there is nothing, that may be uſeful to a Believer, either as to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or publick mercy, but it's knit to Chriſts Interceſſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For privat mercies. 1. Look to the beginning and growth of our ſpiritual life, and to the pouring out of the ſpirit, It is made the fruit of Chriſts Interceſſion, <hi>John</hi> 14.16 <hi>I will pray the father, and he ſhall ſend the comforter:</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 16. <hi>If I go not away the comforter will not come:</hi> This is the Conſolation of a Believer labouring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der deadneſſe of ſpirit, barrenneſſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs, That the pouring out of the ſpirit, is a remedy of that, and the pouring out of the Spirit is a fruit of Chriſts Interceſſion; It's this that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the firſt conviction of the ſpirit to an elect lying in nature; It's this that continues there convictions, and procures the ſpirits quickning of them, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. If it ſhould then be aſked, how a perſon lying in black nature gets any good? It's anſwered, that it's Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion

Though the charge ſhould be given in, what is the matter,, there is a way to be fred of it, there is an Advocat at the right hand of God in heaven, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Cautioner for, and payed the Elects Debt, and is now interceeding for them; and who can loſs the cauſe when he pleads it? and here he quiets, and comforts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, giving a defiance to challenges, and all that can be lybelled againſt him. A 3d. time and occaſion is, under a Croſs-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when Chriſtians have the world in their tops, and their is confuſion in publick things, and there is darkneſs and indiſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our private condition, It ought to comfort us, that we have an Advocat in heaven, who pleads our cauſe, and will not diſpiſe the ſuite of the poor and needy. A 4th. time is, when we our ſelves cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceed for our ſelves, when we pray, but our prayers are much mangled, and little worth, and we think ſhame to look upon them; we would then look on what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt our prayers are put up, If on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of Chriſts Interceſſion, a ſigh, a groan, a broken word, nay a breathing will be accepted; the Interceſſour hath his own incenſe to perfume it with and it's accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the weight that it hath from him; and though our prayer, be but as the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a prayer, if there be honeſty in it, it's a comfort, it will be accepted on that account; <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father, in my name I will do:</hi> And <hi>Revel,</hi> 8. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the prayers of all Saints, the weakeſt as well as the beſt; for the beſt goes not up but by his cenſer, and incenſe, and the weakeſt goes up that ſame way: And there is in ſome reſpect, no diſtinction of Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and of their fervent, or not fervent prayers there, if honeſt; the fervour of Chriſts Interceſſion, and the favour of his incenſe makes all go up, and be accepted; becauſe the reaſon of Gods hearing of our prayers is not in us; elſe he ſhould hear none of them; but it's in his interceſſion, which is of equal worth, and extent to all honeſt prayers of ſound Believers; <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermost, all that come unto God through him;</hi> though there be no ability nor worth in themſelves; becauſe <hi>he lives for ever to make interceſſion for them;</hi> but the <hi>two</hi> laſt things will clear this yet more.</p>

Though this may ſeem ſtrange like; yet it is true, if we conſider the grounds warranding us to make uſe of his Interceſſion, and to draw this Conſolation from it; And they are <hi>Four,</hi> 1. That his Interceſſion ſuppons a defect in us, a libel and charge given in againſt us; elſe what needed we to have an Advocat, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urs</hi> that he makes Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; and 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an advocat,</hi> &amp;c. 2. All the weight of Chriſts Interceſſion, and the grounds whereon he pleads, are in himſelf; and therefore none need to ſtand a back, becauſe there is nothing in themſelves; <hi>We have an advocat with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation;</hi> Chriſt hath in him a fulneſſe to pay the Debt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and he pleads on that, and on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the creature: He ſayes not, let them be pardoned, becauſe they have not ſin, nor becauſe they have ſuch and ſuch qualifications, but becauſe I have been a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for them, I have payed their Debt; Therefore he is called <hi>the righteous,</hi> becauſe he hath reaſon for that which he ſeeks. He hath payed for what he ſeeks, and therefore it cannot but be granted. 3. There is a freedom in the application of all, the application is free Grace every way, and that is clear from the parable of the barren fig-tree; what could the tree ſay,
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:152256:271"/> when Juſtice pleaded it ſhould be cut down? There is nothing in it to procure a delay; but the Gardner ſtands up and bids ſpare it, and he will take pains on it, and apply what is needful; cauſes are not here caſt back, becauſe the partie is poor, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath much Debt on his ſcore; No, <hi>If any man ſin he hath an advocat,</hi> the thing is obtained without money; and without price; would ye then have a Prieſt that ſuits you well? ye ſhall have him, and have him freely; if ye imploy him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for you, he will do it freely, and it's his honour ſo to do. 4. It's free and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, It cannot miſgive; for who pleads? is it not the Son? before whom pleads he? It's before his own Father, who heareth him alwayes; for whom doth he plead? It's for them who are the Fathers own Elect, and his alſo; <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me; and all mine are thine, and thine are mine:</hi> It's for them whom the Father loves as well as he; wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> does he ſeek and plead for? for that which is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted; and he pleads for it, according to the terms of the Covenant; Therefore it's ſure, that though heaven and earth may be mixed, and overturned, yet none can louſe a link here; It's impoſſible, but what he interceeds for, he muſt obtain; and for whom he interceeds, he prevails, and that's for all that imploy him.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly. For <hi>Advertiſement,</hi> or <hi>caveat;</hi> It may be aſked here, may all comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Chriſts Interceſſion?

            <p>IT were a very great Conſolation, and a main furtherance in all Religion, to get this ſolidly believed; That Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>who is the expreſs image of his Fathers perſon, and the brightneſs of his glory,</hi> is now in heaven in our nature, and hath it for his work to be interceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and interceeding for tranſgreſſours; we are every day reaping the good of this Interceſſion, in reference to many evils that are keeped off us, and in reference to many mercies beſtowed on us, that we pray not all, or but little for; and we come never to hear a preaching, but we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to it; it being a peculiar fruit of his interceſſion that gifts are given to men, and that the Goſpel is ſent through the earth; and if ever any get good of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, it is by vertue of this Interceſſion; ſeing he hath ſaid, that <hi>he will pray the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that he will ſend the comforter;</hi> and when ever we come to hear a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there would be (to ſay ſo) a reviſing of the thoughts of Chriſts Interceſſion and a ſtirring up of our ſelves to get the faith of it lively in it's exerciſe.</p>
            <p>That which we ſpake to the laſt day, was concerning the comfort that flows from this, and indeed, if any Doctrine be comfortable, this muſt be comfortable; that we have ſuch a friend in the Court of Heaven, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in this office of an Advocat, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Of exhortation, ſeing there is ſuch an Office wherewith Jeſus Chriſt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted, and ſuch an Officer that bears this Office, to be an Advocat for ſinners; then ſinners would be exhorted to learn to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and to make uſe of this Advocat, and of his Office, ſince he hath this Office of an Interceſſour; O! do not diſpiſe ſuch a mercy, neglect not ſuch an advantage, but learn to make uſe of him, and in your worſhip applications to God to approach by, and through him: The ground of this <hi>Uſe of exhortation</hi> is clear in the Words; and from the nature of the thing; For if Chriſt Jeſus bear theſe Offices, and if he bear them for us, then ſure we ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them: If he be a <hi>King,</hi> we ſhould make uſe of him, for ſubduing ſin in us; If a <hi>Prophet,</hi> we ſhould improve that Office, for attaining of Light, and ſaving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from him; And if he be a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to ſati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fie divine Juſtice, and to make interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we ſhould improve both parts of that Office: The neceſſity of our improving Chriſts Interceſſion appears from this, if
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:152256:272"/> we conſider in what terms we ſtand with God; have we any boldneſſe, or acceſs of our ſelves? is not the door ſhut on us? and is there not a ſtated controverſie ſtanding betwixt God and us? And have we any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs but by his moyen? The neceſſity of it is further clear, from the order that God hath laid down in the way of his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of grace; why, I pray, hath he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Mediator, and Interceſſour? is it not for good reaſon? even for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and encouragement of ſinners to draw near, who, if they be in earneſt, cannot but be affected with fear to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto God; and is it poſſible to come unto God, and not by this door? and were it not ingratitude to neglect it; ſeing he hath contrived this new and living way of acceſs unto him?</p>
            <p>But to deſcend to more particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of this matter, which is as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult a thing to ſpeak of a right, and to practice ſuitably, as any part of Religion; if eſpecially he himſelf teach us not; for ſometimes we will make uſe of his Sacrifice and Satisfaction, when we know not how to make uſe of his Interceſſion; For either we do all our alone, and miſken the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour; or we will do nothing, and give it over as deſperat, as if our buſineſſe were quite broken, and hopeleſſe, and as if it were needleſſe, or uſeleſs to lay any weight on Chriſt's Interceſſion; And thus whether we apprehend our ſelves to be in better, or in worſe caſe, he is much miſkent, and neglected: That therefore we may the better know how to make uſe of Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion; We ſhall, 1. in the general, ſhew what it is to improve it. 2 Speak to ſome particular caſes wherein it in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner is to be improven. 3. Satisfy and remove ſome objections, or anſwer ſome queſtions that may be moved about it. 4. We ſhall give ſome characters of one that is ſerious and tender, in improving of his Interceſſion.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is indeed a thing ſo difficult to improve Chriſts Interceſſion aright, that we cannot eaſily tell how to conceive of it, being a conſiderable part of the miſtery of Faith, to go to God by a Mediator, and Interceſſour; However, we ſhall 1. ſhew ſome miſtakes that are to be eſhewed. 2. We ſhall ſhew wherein it more properly conſiſts; which is, in the exerciſe of Faith in him, with reſpect to his Interceſſion; And 3. We ſhall illuſtrat it by ſome ſimilitudes, for the further mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it. 1. Then, when we ſpake of improving Chriſts Interceſſion, and of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God by him, we would have theſe miſtakes eſhewed. 1. Beware of thinking that there is a going to the Mediator in a diſtinct, or in a different manner from what is, in going to God, for he is God; or that we may go to God at one time, and to the Mediator at another time; as if we would firſt ſpeak a while to the Mediator, and then ſpeak to God, or would firſt make our moan to the Mediator to pacifie God, and when God were calmed to ſpeak to him; as if he were to make moyen with God for us, as a Courti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r makes moyen with the King, the offended partie for a Rebel; we would beware of this: For it divides in our apprehenſion the God-head, that is indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; for if we conſider the Mediator as the object of our worſhip, he is to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as God; though we may, and are alſo joyntly to conſider him as Mediator, and on that account make uſe of him: And if we conſider him as God, we muſt conſider him as the ſame God, with the Father, and the holy Ghoſt; But to have this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of him, that we are to ſpeak to him, as to another Partie, or not as God, is to make him another thing, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming that apprehenſion, and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we ought to have of the unity of the bleſſed God-head. 2. Beware of thinking that there is a greater facility or eaſineſs to have acceſs to the Mediator, then to have acceſs to God; or that it is more eaſie to have acceſs to the <hi>Second</hi> Perſon of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, then to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> or <hi>Third</hi> Perſon; we are afraid that there be miſtakes here alſo, as if the Mediator were more eaſie to be dealt with, then the Majeſty of God; or, as if there were more eaſie acceſs unto him; whereas he being the ſame God, and ſo conſidered; there are the ſame grounds, whereon ſinners may have acceſs to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:152256:273"/> as to the Son; For if we look on a ſinner repenting, and believing, he is as welcome to the Father as to the Son; but if we conſider the ſinner <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s not repenting, and believing, he is ſo, neither welcome to the Father nor to the Son: It is true, the Son being conſidered as man, there is a ſympathy, that the Second Perſon united to our nature hath, which is not in God, abſtractly conſidered; yet this is not ſo to be underſtood, as if the mercy of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, having the two natures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o united in his perſon were of larger extent then the mercy of God; or as if he could be merciful when God is not: For there cannot be greater mercy then that which is infinit, and that is the eſſential attribut of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and holy Ghoſt; only this ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy in the Mediator is to be conſidered, to ſtrengthen and confirm our Faith, in our application to God, that we have him to approach to in our nature; but it is not to give us any new ground of having acceſs eaſier to Chriſt then to God; but (as we ſaid) only to confirm our Faith, in having acceſs to God: Hence it is, that Jeſus Chriſt is alwayes propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

Beware of placing this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, and uſe making of the Mediators Interceſſion in words, or petitions direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Mediator; which I apprehend, is the uſe that the moſt part make of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion: to put up ſuch Petitions, as I am afraid to ſpeak of, as namely, O! Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator at the Fathers right hand plead for me, as if the Mediator were a diſtinct party from the Judge, to whom we muſt ſpeak for interceeding with the Judge, which ſtill leads us to look on the Mediator, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther different party, or as having other terms whereupon he dealleth with Sinners or as if there were another way of making, uſe of him; and of application to him; And on other grounds, then of, and to God; The contrary whereof we have ſhewed; whereas the uſe making of his Interceſſion conſiſts rather (as after will appear) in Faiths application to God in him; and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weight on his Interceſſion for acceſs, and acceptance of our perſons and ſervices; when we make it the ground of our adreſs to God, the ground on which we draw near; and this we may and ſhould do, when we name Chriſt, or pray to him as God, with reſpect to his Office of being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour; even as when we look to him by Faith, to get ſin pardoned; there is a looking to him as God, with reſpect to his offering, and ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God, on which account we expect to be pardoned.</p>
            <p>But, 2ly. to explicat this a little more, we ſhall ſhew wherein this exerciſe of Faith in making uſe of the Mediators Interceſſion, doth mainly conſiſt; And for the more clear following forth thereof, we ſhall ſpeak to theſe <hi>Two,</hi> 1.

<pb n="547" facs="tcp:152256:273"/> to go to God by him, and to lay the weight of what we ſeek and expect, on him, and on his Interceſſion: Now the things that are preſuppoſed to the uſe-making of Chriſt's Interceſſion, guard againſt the firſt extream; and theſe things wherein the uſe making of it properly conſiſts, guard againſt the other extream.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then theſe things preſuppoſed are, 1. A conviction of our natural ſinfulneſs, not only of the diſtance that is betwixt God and us, but of the quarrel and enimity, and that by our deſerving, we may juſtly have the door of acceſs to God ſhut upon us; That is it that puts the ſinner to aſk for an Interceſſour, &amp; to make uſe of him; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in heaven; who will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for them that imploy him: we hazard confidently on that ground, to propoſe our ſuits unto God, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of difficulties, expect and wait for an anſwer: It may be <hi>Objected</hi> here, that it ſeems, there is no difference betwixt the improving of his Satisfaction, and the improving of his Interceſſion, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> There is no difference, in reſpect of the things fought, nor in reſpect of the acts of Faith, whereby we make uſe of the one, and of the other, nor in reſpect of the grounds whereupon; for Chriſt hath payed the debt of them, for whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceeds, he hath purchaſed the ſame things for which he maketh Interceſſion, they are the ſame acts of Faith, that make uſe of both, It's the ſame Covenant, and offer, that warrands us to come to his Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for peace, that warrands us to make uſe of his Interceſſion for the application of peace; There is only this difference that by his Satisfaction he procures us peace, and a right to it, and our peace is made by his laying down before God, the price, which we by Faith take hold of; but when he interceeds, he hath nothing to pay, but interceeds for what he hath purchaſed; Therefore the Scripture hangs the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his purchaſe upon his Interceſſion; He hath bought peace, and every good thing that we ſtand in need of by his death; and by his Interceſſion, he procures and makes the application: Therefore it's on this ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Spirit is poured out; As among men, it's one thing to make peace, and another thing to bring the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending perſon into familiarity with the
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:152256:275"/> offended party; So it's the ſame Faith acting on Chriſts Satisfaction, for being brought in to Covenant with God, as the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſe that acts on Chriſts Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for application of that which he hath purchaſed; but under a different conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, looking on his Satisfaction as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing; and on his Interceſſion, for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the ſame things. A 2d. Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to clear it, is the people under the Law, their making uſe of the high Prieſt; There were two parts of the high Prieſts Office, or two things, wherein the people made uſe of him. 1. For offering Sacrifice; 2. For Interceſſion; The high Prieſt went into the moſt holy once a year, and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the blood, and prayed for the people; in which time they were ſtanding without praying, in the hope of having their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers made the more acceptable: This was by Gods appointment typically to prefigure our Lords Interceſſion in heaven; It is true, the high Prieſts praying for them was nothing to the Souls advantage, of him or them, if Chriſt was not made uſe of, both by him, and by them; yet it was typical, and to ſhew this much, that they were to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Chriſts Interceſſion, as well as his Sacrifice and Satisfaction; Therefore, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.10. When <hi>Zacharias</hi> went in to pray, the whole multitude of the people was without praying. A 3d. ſimilitude (which we have hinted at in our going along) is drawn from that way that is uſed among men, for bringing two parties that are at ods, and variance, to be reconciled, and at one; which though we are not to conceive in that carnal manner, yet it holds as to the ſubſtance of the thing; as if the offending party durſt not go his alone, to the party offended, but ſhould carrie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him a friend, that hath place, and power to prevail with the other; when he undertakes to go along with him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his deſerving, he will expect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently to get a good hearing; and if any ſhould ſay to him, how dar you go to ſuch an one, whom you have ſo provocked? he would anſwer, becauſe I have a friend before me, that will make moyen for me; and when by that friends moyen, he gets a favourable hearing, and his ſuit granted, he comes away rejoycing, profeſſing his great obligation to that friend; So is it here as to the thing, though as was ſaid, we would guard againſt carnal conceptions, of taking up God, and the Mediator as diſtinct parties to be made application to, we ſhall inſiſt no further for the time, O! that there were ſeriouſneſs to improve his Blood and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, for waſhing us from the guilt of ſin, and for making our peace with God, and his Interceſſion, for upholding our peace and communion with God, and for the attaining of every good, that he hath purchaſed and promiſed, which is the ſum of all, God help us to the practice of it, and to be conſcientious in it.</p>

<pb n="546" facs="tcp:152256:276"/> that can tell how Chriſts Interceſſion is to be improven? Sure we may know that if ever we do it, there is no th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Ye may remember the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that we propoſed to ſpeak to was this; That our Lord Jeſus hath this for a part of his Office, to make Interceſſion for tranſgreſſours; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a real Prieſt, he not only offers a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but goes in, and hath gone within the vail, with the vertue of his Sacrifice, to appear before God in heaven for us; as all the Offices of Chriſt are advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and would be ſtudied by us, and we would ſtudy them well; this hath many advantages with it, and we would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, leaſt we fruſtrat our ſelves of the cluſter of priviledges that is in this one Doctrine, That Jeſus Chriſt makes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for tranſgreſſours, or ſinners.</p>
            <p>We ſhew the laſt day wherein the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of Chriſts Interceſſion doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; we ſhall now inſtance ſome caſes wherein Believers, in a ſpecial manner are to make uſe of it. 2. We ſhall give ſome directions for clearing ſome queſtions, or for anſwering ſome doubts about it. And 3. We ſhall asſigne ſome Characters of ſuch as are rightly improving Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercesſion.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſts Interceſſion ought to be made uſe of in as many caſes as are poſſibly incident to a Believer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not to reſtrict it to one caſe more then to another; although indeed there be ſome wherein more eſpecially we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to improve it; Now to clear it, that there are ſome caſes wherein, in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Believer is to make uſe of this Office of Chriſts interceeding for tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours; It may be inſtanced in theſe, 1. A Believer hath either liberty, or he is in bonds; and there is a ſpecial watchfulneſs called for in both theſe caſes, that the Interceſſion of Chriſt be not ſlighted.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When he hath liberty, and his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual condition thryves, he prayes, and his heart melts in prayer, he hath what he would have, the exerciſes of Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pleaſant, and he hath no will to come from them: In this caſe the Believer is to beware, leaſt he be ſtollen off his feet, and miſken Chriſts Interceſſion; for then he is ready to think that he cannot but be well, and his prayers cannot but be heard; becauſe he gets liberty to put them up, and it's then often that there is hazard to lay leaſt weight on Chriſts Interceſſion: To improve Chriſts Interceſſion aright in ſuch caſes, theſe <hi>Two</hi> are to be adverted to. 1. That his Interceſſion be acknowledged as the fountain, and procuring cauſe of that liberty and livelineſs, and ſo we are to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a ſtoped mouth before God, and not to boaſt of it; For (as we ſhew) the pouring out of the Spirit is a ſpecial fruit of Chriſts Interceſſion; It being by vertue thereof that gifts are given, and grace to worſhip God in a ſpiritual manner. 2. That we beware of thinking that our prayers are in a fitneſs, or that they put us in a fitneſs of acceſs to God, becauſe of that liberty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by vertue of Chriſts Interceſſion, more then if we had not a word to ſay; There is in our unbelief, and preſumption, a ſecret inclination to lay the weight of our accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on our own liberty, Whereas, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8. the prayers of all Saints muſt come up before God, having the ſmoak of his incenſe to make them acceptable; In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, in a caſe of liberty, Chriſts Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is made uſe of, and improven, when we are denyed to our own liberty, and it is not made the ground of our confident ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to God, but Chriſts Interceſſion on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y: Again 2. when the Believer is in bonds, in ſome eminent manner, ſo that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray, he ſcarce hath a word to ſpeak to God; he goes, it's true about the duty, but he comes not ſpeed; his prayer reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es not to himſelf, he is like one ſpeaking, but not praying, his heart is not warmed, neither is there, at leaſt to his own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, any connexion betwixt his words, whereupon he is ready to think that his prayer is as good as no prayer, becauſe of that inclination that is in all of us, to reſt

               </gap>t we faint, and grow wear in prayer, which cannot but befal us, if his Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not made uſe of. 2. Leaſt we loſs the eſtimation of the excellent worth of Chriſts Interceſſion; which is exceeding derogatory to him that is <hi>mighty to ſave, and on whom help is laid:</hi> and it is eſpecially for ſuch a time and caſe, that he is holden forth for an Interceſſour: Now there is a <hi>twofold</hi> improvement of Chriſts Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion called for in this caſe; when the Believer is in bonds, and cannot ſo much as ſigh; but it's called in queſtion whether it be accepted; though yet the man is ſerious. 1. There is an improving of it for obtaining of that which we have been aiming at, though we cannot tell our own teal (to ſpeak ſo) nor open our cauſe, nor make known our requeſts to God; yet to expect what we have been aiming at, and ſeeking after, by vertue of Chriſts Interceſſion, for as ill ſet together, as our prayer hath been, becauſe it is founded upon the Interceſſion of the Mediator; and we expect a hearing on that account ala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erly, it being his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, that makes our prayers accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, it can make ſuch a poor prayer accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able alſo; whereupon the Soul reſts quiet, and expects a hearing on this ground; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as was ſaid, the prayers of all Saints go up from his Cenſer, and with his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and none are caſt back, that are put up through him, and by vertue of his Interceſſion; Hence ſometimes looks, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoughts, ſometimes broken words, and groans come up before God, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and get a return; The reaſon is, becauſe, through the Interceſſion of the Mediator, the prayers of all Saints are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable: This is even as if a man ſhould credit his able Advocat with the managing of his Cauſe, although he cannot, (to ſpeak ſo) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce, we have theſe words often, <hi>John</hi> 14. and 16. <hi>Whatever ye ask in my name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, ye ſhall receive; and whatever ye ask in my name, I will do it;</hi> that is, when ye ground the expectation of your hearing, and ſpeed-coming in prayer on me, and my mediation: when folks, becauſe of their ſhort-comings in prayer give over the expectation of a hearing, and a return; they give over, in ſo far, the laying of due weight on his Interceſſion: only ye would remember the terms on which a perſon is warranted to make uſe of his Interceſſion; for when we follow not his way, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of it, we cannot expect to come ſpeed, or get good by it. 2. A Believer in his bonds, would expect a louſing, through the vertue of his Interceſſion; And this is another way, how we would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it in this caſe, when we are bound up, and (to ſpeak ſo) langled, that we cannot ſtir in prayer, then we would have an eye to the efficacy of Chriſts Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (that is of continual vigour and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, even when we are very dead, indiſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and lifeleſſe,) for the attaining of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and livelineſs; This is indeed to caſt a look to him, and ſingly to improve the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his mediation; when we cannot ſpeak on word to work up our ſelves to a diſpoſition for that work: And theſe two go well together, to be improving his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, for obtaining what we need for the time preſent, and for the time to come; and when we are in bonds, to be improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for liberty and freedom.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. There is an uſe-making of Chriſts Interceſſion called for; both when we aim to obtain any thing; and when we have obtained that which we would be at. 1. In our aiming to have, or obtain; we would improve it, that our addreſſes to God may be in his name, and our Faith of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining may be founded on Chriſts Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and not on our own, and that our Faith may be ſtayed, and fixed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the thing: The improving of Chriſts Interceſſion in his reſpect, leads us, 1. To the right way of proſecuting our ſuits to God, and 2. It quiets and fix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s us in expecting of an anſwer; and when this is wanting, Chriſtians are either diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and know not how to purſue their cauſe, or elſe they are carnally ſecure, and
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:152256:277"/> preſumptuous, which is very ordinary; for either, as I have ſaid, we are under an anxious fear, ſo that we know not how to go about dutie with any hope of ſucceſs; or elſe we grow ſecure and ſlack, and careleſs in dutie.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. There is an uſe-making of Chriſts Interceſſion, when we have obtained any benefit, which keeps the Soul in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and debt, and in acknowledging it ſelf to be his Debtor; This makes Chriſtians, when they have gotten any thing, to be humble, and helps them to a ſanctified uſe of the thing received; whereas, when this is forgotten, though Perſons may be ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly humble when they are praying for a thing in his name, yet when they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it, they grow carnal, and ſome way wanton, and he is forgotten, as if the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit had never come from him; But on the other hand, when there is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of Chriſts Interceſſion, when any thing is obtained; it keeps, as I ſaid, the Perſon humble, and holily afra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, when it hath gotten, as well as when it was ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and it makes warrie in uſing, and fearful to abuſe any benefit received; leaſt it be found a wrong and indignity done to Chriſt and his Interceſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. We may inſtance the improving of Chriſts Interceſſion, both in a moſt ſad, and in a moſt cheerful condition; In refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to both which we ſhould make uſe of Chriſts Interceſſion, and it being readily one of theſe conditions that we are in, either a more ſad, or more cheerful one; we would think our ſelves defective and faulty as to our duty, when we ſuit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not our way to our condition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it be a more ſad condition, whether we be ſpiritually ſad, the Soul being heavy, and refuſing to be comforted, or whether we be under a temporal outward di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat condition; there is an uſe-making of Chriſts Interceſſion called for in both; For a Believer cannot be in any ſo diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolat a condition; but he may draw refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this Fountain, in reference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and when we make not uſe of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion in each, as it occurs; either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety, and diſcouragement grows, or we turn to ſome unwarrantable, and crooked mean, or way for an out-gate from ſuch a diſconſolat condition.</p>
            <p>Now to make uſe of, and to improve Chriſts Interceſſion aright, in ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolat condition, and caſe. 1. The Soul would gather, and compoſe it ſelf, to ſearch and ſee what is uſeful in Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for it's caſe; ſeing that ſad caſe cannot be imagined, but Chriſts Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a cordial for it, upon which, as a ſolid ground, the Soul may be quiet, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not miſcarry in that for which it is now in ſo much bitterneſs; ſeing Chriſt Jeſus hath the managing of it's caſe and cauſe: Hence it may reaſon thus, although I was unwatchful, and this condition came on me unawars, and I was ſurpriſed with it, yet it's not any ſurpriſe to him; He was not ſleeping, though I was, he knew what was coming, though I knew not; therefore this will not hurt, nor prejudge my main cauſe, becauſe it comes through his hand. 2. There is an improvement of his Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this caſe, when the out-gate, though deſperat, as to us; is yet hopeful by vertue thereof; and when this is made the only, or main ground of our hope, to wit, That there is a friend at the court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who can order our cauſe, and make ſuch a thing work for our good; It puts ſpirits in us to pray, and actively to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the uſe of the means; whereas, when we uſe not the means, or uſe them without due reſpect to Chriſts Interceſſion, the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe becomes heartleſſe, hopleſſe and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat.</p>

<pb n="553" facs="tcp:152256:279"/> as Eternity, and Immutability are; There can be no Adoring, or Worſhipping of any, but where there is Adorability in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that is worſhipped by that worſhip; and there is none capable of worſhip but God, Supremacy being due, and Eſſential to him only: 2. That though there be three Perſons in the glorious and bleſſed God-head, diſtinct, yet there are not three diſtinct Objects of Worſhip, but one Object of Worſhip only; The Father is not one Object of Worſhip, the Son ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the holy Ghoſt a third; but the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt are that ſame one Object of Worſhip; And when we pray to one, we pray to all. The reaſon is clear; Becauſe, though there be three Perſons in the God-head, yet there is but one Eſſence in the God-head; and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eſſential Properties (which are the grounds on which we adore God) are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, and agree to all the Perſons of the God-head; the Father hath not one Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, and the Son another; neither are there two Omnipotents; but one Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent God; and ſo in other Attributs, they are the ſame eſſential properties of the God-head, and incommunicable; And therefore, though the Father be another Perſon, and (as they uſe to ſpeak) <hi>alius,</hi> yet he is not another thing, or <hi>aliud,</hi> but the ſame God, with the Son, and holy Ghoſt; And although the Perſons have a real diſtinction amongſt themſelves, yet none of them are really diſtinct from the God-head; and ſo there is but one Object of Worſhip; and therefore, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times all the Perſons be named, yet it's not to ſhew any diſtinction in the Object of our worſhip, but to ſhew who is the Object of our worſhip; To wit, one God, yet three Perſons, or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That though in prayer to God, we may name either the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghoſt; yet whomſoever we name, it's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the ſame God, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt that is worſhipped: And this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth well on the former, and may be the uſe of it; For if the Father be God, and if we worſhip him as God, we cannot worſhip him, but we muſt worſhip the Son, and Holy Ghoſt with him, becauſe they are the ſame God, having the ſame eſſential Attributs. And therefore 4. Whenſoever we pray to, and name one of the Perſons, we would not conceive that he is leſſe worſhipped, that is not named, or that we pray leſſe to him that is not named, as it may be in the ſame prayer, when a Perſon begins at firſt, he names the Father, and when he hath proceeded a little, he names the Son, men would then beware of thinking that there is a difference in the Object they are praying to; or, as if they began to pray to one of the Perſons, and now they are praying to another, as a diſtinct party; for it is ſtill the ſame God, who is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of worſhip; We obſerve it, to teach you calmneſs, ſoberneſs, and compoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of frame in approaching to God; wherein folks would beware of curious toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in their mind, and imagination, what may be the Object of their worſhip, and of ſuffering it to run in an itchingly curious way on the diſtinction of the Perſons; but would ſtay their mind upon one God in three Perſons, and ſeek after no more.</p>
            <p>The 2d. is, How the Mediator is the Object of our prayers, or may be prayed unto? and for clearing of this, we would propoſe theſe conſiderations. 1. That it is a certain truth, that the Perſon that is the Mediator, is the Object of our woriſhip, and may be prayed unto, becauſe he is God, the ſecond Perſon of the God-head: And therefore, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. at the cloſe, a direct prayer is put up to him by <hi>Stephen, Lord Jeſus,</hi> ſaith he <hi>receive my Spirit.</hi> 2. We ſay this, That the Adoration and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that is given to the Mediator, is not of any diſtinct kind from that Adoration, and Worſhip that is given to the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, but the ſame ſupream divine worſhip, for he is the ſame God with the Father and Holy Ghoſt; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be Mediator, it derogats nothing from his God-head; and the Scripture ſpeaking of no divine Worſhip but one, we are therefore not to conceive him to be worſhipped with leſſe confidence, fear, or reverence then the other Perſons of the Trinity: For there is no ſuch worſhip in
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:152256:280"/> Scripture; and to give him leſſe, would derogat from the Majeſty of Jeſus Chriſt, who is God equal with the Father, and the Spirit: For, although, as Mediator, he be inferiour to the Father, yet the Perſon whom we worſhip, is God equal with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt. 3. The worſhipping of Jeſus Chriſt Mediator, and the giving of him divine worſhip, is not the worſhipping of any other Object, but of the ſame, to wit God, who is made fleſh, and is manifeſted in our nature by the union of the ſecond Perſon of the God-head, with the humane nature, which he hath aſſumed, and taken to him; upon which it follows, that Jeſus Chriſt muſt be the ſame Object of worſhip, and that our worſhipping of him, is the worſhipping of God, and that our praying to him, is pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God the Father, Son and Spirit: And there is reaſon to take heed to this, becauſe, when we in prayer are ſpeaking to the Mediator, thoughts may ſteal in, as if we were not ſo immediatly and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking to God, as when we name the Father. 4. Conſider, That Chriſt Jeſus being worſhipped with this divine worſhip, as the one Object of worſhip (for as we ſhew, there cannot be two Objects of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip) it will follow, that Chriſt Jeſus as God is worſhipped, for though it be the Perſon that's Mediator, and Man that is worſhipped; yet it's not the Perſon as Man, but as God, that is worſhipped; And the reaſon is clear, becauſe it's not Chriſt Jeſus as Man, but as God, that hath theſe properties of God, to be Omni-ſcient, Omni-potent, Infinit, Supream, Adorable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore, as upon the one hand, we ſay that Chriſt God died, and ſuffered, becauſe he being God and Man in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Perſon that was, and is God died, and ſuffered, though the God-head did not, neither can ſuffer: So upon the other hand, we ſay, that Chriſt Man is prayed unto, becauſe he who is God Man is pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, as God; But though there be an union of the two natures, in the Mediators Perſon, and though the properties of the one nature be ſometimes attributed to the other, becauſe of the ſtraitneſſe of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet we muſt ſtill keep the properties of each nature diſtinct, and in our worſhip-application to him, conſider him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; As to be finite, agrees to his humane nature, and is to be attributed to that; and to be infinite agrees to his divine nature, and is to be attributed to him, in reſpect of that: To clear it a little, (if it be poſſible for us to clear it) we muſt conceive in our worſhipping of God, in the Perſon of a Mediator, A <hi>threefold</hi> Object of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; (for ſo Divines uſe to diſtinguiſh, and we hold us cloſſe by them) 1. The <hi>Material</hi> Object, or the Object which we worſhip, that is the Perſon we pray to. 2. The <hi>Formal</hi> Object of our worſhip, or that which is the ground, or account on which we worſhip that Perſon. 3. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our <hi>Conſideration,</hi> in our worſhipping of that Perſon; on that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ount; As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. 1. The Man Chriſt Jeſus is the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom we worſhip, or pray unto; but 2. The formal Object of our worſhip is Chriſts God-head; and we pray to him on that account; becauſe He is the Eternal, Infinit, Omni-potent, Supream, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in reſpect of his divine nature. 3. In our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of this Mediator, on this account, or ground, the mind may be ſwayed to it, on conſideration that the perſon whom we worſhip as God, is alſo Mediator and Man; and this propoſes no new Object of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but gives a motive to induce us to worſhip him, and warms the heart with love to him; as when we go to pray to him, the mind may conſider him as one that died; now ſo conſidered he is not the Object of our worſhip, becauſe it holds him out as humbled, and ſuffering; yet our ſo conſidering him ſtrengthens Faith, to expect what we need from him; and it induces to pray to him, and engages to love him: even as the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God, ſometimes uſed that Title, <hi>Our redeemer that brought us out of Egypt:</hi> Yet the ground, and account on which they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him was his being the Eternal, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit, and Omnipotent God, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his Works were but motives to induce them to worſhip him, and to ſtrengthen their Faith, in expecting what
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:152256:280"/> they ſtood in need of from him: So is it here, For if it were poſſible to conceive, that the Mediator that died were not God, we would not pray to him, for God is the alone Object of divine worſhip; yet to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that he is God, and yet died, is an inducement to us, to pray to him, and it ſtrengthens our Faith to conſider, that as he is God, ſo alſo Man; one that died, and hath alſo entered himſelf in this near relation to us.</p>
            <p>For the 3d. (which will help to clear the former) That is, the forms of ſuch Petitions as may be uſed, in petitioning the Mediator; we need the leſſe to ſtand on it, if (as hath been ſaid) we hold us by theſe grounds. 1. That there is but one Object of worſhip. 2. That this one Object of worſhip is God. 3. That in worſhipping the Mediator, we do not divine that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our worſhip: Yet we ſhall ſpeak a word for clearing, 1. What form ſeems moſt allowable here? 2. For clearing of ſomewhat which we hinted at the other day anent one particular form of petition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> then, This is clear, that we may pray directly to the Mediator, by naming him, as <hi>Stephen</hi> does, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. at the cloſe. 2. That the Mediator, when prayed to, may be conſidered as ſuch by us; For there is a differenee betwixt that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by us, in the act of our worſhip, and that which is the Object of that Act; and (as we ſaid) the motive that induces us to that Act, is the uptaking of him as Mediator. 3. That he may be deſigned <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> and <hi>Redeemer;</hi> and may get theſe Names and Titles, becauſe they ſerve to ſtrengthen our Faith, and to warm our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to him; even as when the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> prayed to God, they remembred that he was their Redeemer and Deliverer, and had wrought ſo and ſo for them, and theſe were motives to induce them to pray, and ſerved to ſtrengthen their Faith in praying to him; yet the ground and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count on which they worſhipped him, was his own infinit glorious Majeſty. 4. It's clear, that when the Mediator is prayed unto, ſomething may be ſought from him, that agrees to the Office of the Mediator, For inſtance, he may be prayed unto, to take to him his Government, and to exerce it, to give gifts unto men, to gather his own Elect, to make his will effectual for the ingathering of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet even then a difference would be put betwixt the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our ſutie, and the matter we ſuite for, which belongs to him as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, yet as God he is the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now, as for the 2d. thing, If all this be granted, it may then be aſked, why we ſeem not to be ſatisfied with that manner of expreſſion, or form of petition, which we hinted at the other day, <hi>Lord Jeſus make interceſſion for me, plead for me with, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father?</hi> Seing we allow ſuch a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this, <hi>Lord Jeſus make me partaker of thy interceſſion,</hi> and the like, As war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably, when put up with reverence, and faith, The ſame Object of worſhip being invocat with them both? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 1. We ſay, that the uſe-making, and improving of Chriſts Interceſſion, is not to be reſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this manner of expreſſion, or form of Petition; and it was for this end that we obſerved it: For it cannot be ſaid, that only we make uſe of Chriſts Interceſſion, when we uſe this form; and ſo it's not eſſential, nor neceſſary to the uſe-making of Chriſt's Interceſſion; This is the fault that is in it, as if there were no uſe-making of his Interceſſion, but when this form of Petition is uſed; whereas we ſhew, that it is mainly the exerciſe of Faith, reſting on his Interceſſion, whereby it is improven, and one may be uſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng this forme of word,
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:152256:281"/> and yet not be improving his Interceſſion; And another may not uſe this form of words, and yet be improving it, when Faith is exerciſed on it; and th refore to improve his Interceſſion, is rather by the exerciſe of Faith to reſt on it, then in any ſuch form of words to pray to him; and we would not think that Chriſt's Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not made uſe of when the Father is prayed unto; or when ſuch a form of words is not uſed, but place it in the exerciſe of Faith alone. 2. We ſay, if ſuch a petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be well underſtood and qualified, it is not ſimply ſinful or evil, if ſo be that our meaning in it amount to this much; Lord Jeſus let me be partaker of the benefites of thy Interceſſion, even as we may pray, Lord Jeſus let me be partaker of the benefits of thy Satisfaction; yet we ſay it would be well underſtood and qualified; and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in putting up ſuch a petition would advert well, that he be not praying to any other Object of worſhip but God, and that his meaning be the ſame, as if he were praying to the Father, and ſaid, Father, let me be accepted through the Interceſſion of the Son; And thus the one is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of Chriſts Interceſſion, as well as the other; for although the altering the nomination of the perſon may ſtrengthen Faith, yet it is never to be ſo underſtood, as if they were a different Object of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or as if there were leſſe acceſſe to Chriſt's Interceſſion, or to the benefits thereof, in the one form then in the other; Yet 3. we ſay there is often a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to miſcarry in this form of Petition; For ye would conſider and examine. 1. If it doth not often flow from a miſ-inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed judgement within; and if it hath not a tendency in it, to obſcure the nature of the unity of the Object of our worſhip; and readily diſpoſing to, or flowing from this opinion, that praying to the Mediator is not the ſame, that praying to God is, as if there were two diſtinct objects of worſhip. Or, 2. If there be not a readineſs to conſider the perſon that's Mediator to be of leſs Glory and Majeſty then the Father, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Father to be of leſſe loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and tenderneſſe to ſinners then the Son, and other things of that kind, which move people to put up a ſuite in ſuch a form, which makes it more difficult to keep the thoughts of one Object of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip under ſuch a form, then otherwayes: Yet 4. we ſay it may be uſed by, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, from, many that have not that diſtinctions, and clearneſſe in the ridding of their thoughts, in this Myſtery that is requiſite; becauſe there may be real faith under ſuch a form of words, (though infirmity in the uſe-making of Chriſt's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion) and God reſpects that wherever it is, And under ſuch a form there may be theſe two things, 1. A Soul-ſenſibleneſs, that the perſon hath no acceſſe to God, but through a Mediator. 2. A reſting on the Mediator for acceptance, and where theſe two are though the form be uſed, it may be accepted; although, if Faith be though this form be not, it mars not the perſons acceptation; For no queſtion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the people of God both before Chriſt came and ſometime after, had not that diſtinctneſs in uſe-making of the Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt as now is holden forth, as Chriſt ſayes to his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 16.24. <hi>Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name;</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> mentioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. and others, their prayers were accepted of God, though they reſted by faith on the Mediator in a more confuſed dark way, and had not that diſtinctneſſe in them, of uſe-making of him, which was afterward more clearly revealed; And therefore, 5. and laſtly, Though we will not be peremptory in condemning ſuch a form altogether, yet we think it largely as ſafe to abſtain from any ſuch form of words, in the uſe-making of Chriſts interceſſion, as may have in them any appearance of or tendency to the dividing of the Object of our worſhip, or the Mediator from his God-head, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in praying with, or for others, where it may ſtumble more then edifie; and when it is uſed, it would be very warrily, and well guarded, remembring alwayes that the improving of Chriſts Interceſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts more in Faiths reſting on it, and in making addreſſe to God through him, and according to the uſual manner of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:152256:281"/> then, in any other thing or way what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>The 4, thing we propoſed to ſpeak a word to, was ſome <hi>Practical Doubts,</hi> or <hi>Queſtions,</hi> that may puzle ſome Chriſtians who having obſerved, what hath been ſpoken on this ſubject, may be ready to think and ſay, That the improving of Chriſts Interceſſion is to them a greater myſtery then ever it was, many times they have prayed and minded it not, and when they mind it, they are not diſtinct in their improving of it, and they are never like aright to mind it: For <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 1. Ye would look to what is eſſential to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of Chriſts Interceſſion, and make that ſure; And if ye aſk, what it is? It takes in theſe <hi>Four,</hi> which, where they are, His Interceſſion is made uſe of, though there may be unclearneſſe, in many other things, 1. That a perſon pray to God, that he be called on, and worſhipped. 2. That our addreſſes be not founded on any thing in our ſelves, but that there be a renouncing of our own righteouſneſſe, as it was with <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 9.18. <hi>We do not preſent our ſupplications unto thee for our own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. 3. That there be a believing of our acceptation through Jeſus Chriſt, though there be a diſtance betwixt God and us, yet that there is a way through uſe-making of Chriſt to come over that diſtance, and to win at nearneſſe to Him. And 4. Upon that account to enter our ſuite, and to put up our prayer to God; with the one word diſclaiming our own righteouſneſſe, and with the other pleading on the account of Gods mercy, through Chriſt, as <hi>Daniel</hi> doth, <hi>Not for our righteouſneſs, but for thy mercies ſake, and for thy names ſake;</hi> Now I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that Souls ſhould not be able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſeveral queſtions about the Object of worſhip, and the way of improving of Chriſts Interceſſion; yet if they call upon God; if they renounce their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, not knowing any ground in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to lean to, or to put up their ſuite on, and make uſe of Chriſt for the ground of their acceptance with God; and if it were aſked them, what gives you ground to expect a hearing of your prayers? they would anſwer, even the ſame that gives us ground to expect pardon of Sin; and we would never expect to win to either without a Mediator; they are amongſt them who are improving Chriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s Interceſſion, and ſuch would ſilence and uſh other queſtions, if they be clear in this. 2. We anſwer, That there may be a real uſe making of Chriſts Interceſſion, and it may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſo, where there is much indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctneſs in the uptaking of it; as theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances clear, of <hi>Cornelius, Act.</hi> 10. And of the Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 16. who prayed not on the account of their own righteouſneſſe, or of the Covenant of works; (for they made confeſſion of their ſin) yet the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and his Interceſſion was not ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly as ſuch, conſidered by them in their ſo doing; For they did not diſtinctly take up; him as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Hithereo ye have asked nothing in my name;</hi> yet there was an actual reſting on him by Faith, and their prayers were, no doubt accepted of God; He not being ſo diſtinctly known to be the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour as now he is; and therefore there is required a more diſtinct uſe making of him now; and not a reſting on him indefinitly, but particularly, and diſtinctly, He being clearly revealled now, to be the Mediator. 3. We anſwer, That Believers may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be making uſe of Chriſt's Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in approaching to God by him, and yet they themſelves not know diſtinctly, that they are doing ſo; As we ſee in the Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 14.4. Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I go ye know, and the way ye know:</hi> And <hi>v,</hi> 6. ſpeaking of coming to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by him, He ſayes, <hi>I am the way, the truth and the life;</hi> and yet, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſayes, <hi>Lord, we know not whither thou goest, and how can we know the way?</hi> And the Lord turns it over to him, and ſayes, that <hi>they have both known him, and the way.</hi> As alſo Believers may ſometimes, through want of clearneſſe and diſtinctneſs in this, what it is to make uſe of Chriſts Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or, becauſe they want that meaſure of diſtinctneſſe they would be at, think that they are doing nothing, as to the uſe-mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Interceſſion; and yet the work of Gods Spirit, though they know it not
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:152256:282"/> well, may be leading them; For it's in this, as it is in uſe-making of his Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a Believer may be making uſe of Chriſts Sa isfaction, and be juſtified by it, when he knows not that it is ſo, or poſſibly cannot well tell what it is to make uſe of it; which may quiet any riſings, and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that may be in their mind about this matter. 4. We anſwer that explicite thoughts of Chriſts Interceſſion, are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes neceſſary nor requiſit for the uſe-making of it; even as we are to deſign Gods Glory, as our main end in all our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings; ſo we are to pray in the name of Chriſt; but as it is not requiſit that there be alwayes, and all along the action, an actual minding of Gods Glory, but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid as our principle, which we walk by, and the ſtrain of our walk, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation tending to that end; it is, and will be accepted before God, although there be not in, and along every thing we do, explicit thoughts of His Glory; So it it in our praying in Chriſts name, and in improving of His Interceſſion; there may be a virtual, though not an actual, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit reſting on it; the Soul having laid down that for a ground and principle, that it's not for any thing in me, that I do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a hearing, but it's through Chriſt, and all the confidence that I have to be heard, it's through him. 5. We anſwer, That a poor Soul, that wotes not well what to do in this caſe, would eye Gods promiſe, to be guided in the uſe-making of Chriſts Interceſſion without anxiety, as it is, <hi>John</hi> 16.26. <hi>In that day ye ſhal ask in my name:</hi> As if he had ſaid It hath been you fault, that ye have not hitherto prayed in my name, at leaſt with that diſtinctneſs that ye ought; but I give you my word for it, <hi>ye ſhall pray in my name;</hi> and when through confuſion, we are ready to faint, we would eye this promiſe to be guided in the uſe-making of his Interceſſion. 6. We would learn rather to hold us in our worſhipping of God, with that which is practical, and ſerves to bring us under an awe, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Majeſty of God; then give our ſelves to that which doth indiſpoſe, and diſquiet us: And I ſhall cloſe all with this word, that we would even admire, how Souls are carried and brought to heaven, that we ſhould be ſuffered to pray, and that God breaks not out upon us; and we would ſtudy to be deeply humbled for our ignorance of God, and of Chriſt; and would think our ſelves to be much in his debt and common for teaching us to make right uſe of Him, ſeing we are ſo ready to miſcarry, even when we deſire, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make uſe of him.</p>

            <p>THe greateſt priviledges that we have by the Goſpel, do often hold forth the greateſt aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of our Sin; as being againſt ſo great and excellent priviledges; Now that the Lord hath given us a Mediator; and that this one part of his Mediation, to wit, to make Interceſſion for Tranſgreſſours, or Sinners; is one of the great priviledges of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is beyond all doubt; and therefore, we had need to fear, leaſt by our abuſing, and not improving aright of this priviledge it prove an aggravation of our guilt: And this is the laſt thing that we would ſpeak a word to, from theſe Words; That ſeeing our Lord Jeſus is inveſted with this Office, to be an Interceſſour, then it muſt be a ground of expoſtulation with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of theſe, who ſhall be found ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of His Interceſſion; For, if it be a Duty to improve his Interceſſion, and if it be a Mercy that we have it, and if many advantages be gotten by it; then it muſt be a grievous Sin, a matter of juſt chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and great ſhame, that Sinners ſhould have ſuch an Advocat and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour provided for them, to take and plead their cauſe ſo freely, and to manage it ſo dexterouſly as He doth; and yet to ſlight Him, and not to put that truſt in Him, as to commit their cauſe to Him.</p>
            <p>In proſecuting of this <hi>Uſe,</hi> we ſhall 1. Shew, that there is ſuch a Sin as not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of Chriſts Interceſſion, and how it is fallen into. 2. The cauſes of it, or whence it comes, that folks ſo much miſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken this part of Chriſts Office. 3. The great inconveniences that follow on it, and the prejudices that are ſuſtained by it. 4. We ſhall hint at ſome ſymptomes and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, where this Sin is. And 5. ſpeak a word to the remedies in oppoſition thereunto.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is ſuch a Sin, it may be clear from a few Conſiderations, that may be obvious to every one of us. 1. It may be clear from the effect, what is the cauſe that ſo many come ſo little ſpeed in prayer, that they pray, and yet get not a hearing, ſo that in the day of Judgement, it will be found that many prayed, and that their prayers were caſt back as dung upon their faces, <hi>They ſought to enter, and were not able,</hi> as it is, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. And this will be found to be the reaſon of it, that they went to God, but miſken'd, or took not notice of him, who is <hi>is the way, the truth, and the life:</hi> For where Chriſts Interceſſion is improven, there is an effect following; For God hath laid it down for a ſolid ground, that <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh;</hi> and, <hi>Whatſoever ye ask in my name, it ſhall be granted:</hi> And therefore where there are many Petitions put up to God, and no anſwer at all; There is ſure a crack and default in folks making uſe of Chriſt; For God is faithful, and will perform His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. 2. And more particularly, all the Members of the viſible Church may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to theſe <hi>Three</hi> Ranks; and we will
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:152256:283"/> find a defect as to the uſe-making of Chriſts Interceſſion, in them all, though not of the ſame degree, or rather not of the ſame kind. 1. Either they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, and have not ſo much as a form of Religion, and ſuch do ſlight Chriſt, and his Interceſſion altogether, Or 2. They are Hypocrites, that make a faſhion of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but come not to God by Him, but at the ſhort cut proudly ſtep forward, and put up their ſuits upon the account of their own righteouſneſſe; As they ground their Juſtification on it, and not on Chriſts Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, ſo they put up their prayers to God, on the account of their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; and not on the account of Chriſts Interceſſion, Or 3. They are ſuch as have ſomething of God in them, and ſo are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and even in ſuch there is often a great defect, as to this; as Chriſt ſayes to the Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 16.24. <hi>Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name;</hi> He charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them not ſimply for not praying, he grants that, <hi>but ye have not asked in my name,</hi> That is, ye have not made uſe of my Interceſſion, as ye ſhould have done; although there be not ſuch a defect in them as there is in the former two ſorts, yet there is a great ſhort-coming, and not an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of Chriſts Interceſſion, as they ſhould: And therefore. 3. It will be more clear, if we conſider the particular caſes incident to Believers; wherein we will find, that but very ſcarcely Chriſts Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is improven in any of them; As, 1. If the Believer hath liberty in prayer, he is ready to ſit down on it, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he cannot but be heard, becauſe he hath liberty; and there is not ſo ſingle an eye had to Chriſts Interceſſion; and of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en it's more difficult to hold off this Sin, when liberty is injoyed, then when it is wanting; becauſe, though liberty be good and deſirable in it ſelf, yet through our corruption, and pride it's often abuſed; even as when Chriſtians win to ſome good meaſure of holineſs; it is in ſome reſpect more difficult to reſt upon Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, then if that meaſure were not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; So is it here more difficult, ſome way to reſt upon Chriſts Interceſſion when we have liberty in prayer, then when we are in bonds, and under reſtraint. 2. Upon the other hand, if we look to a Believer when he is ſtraitned and it goes not well with him in prayer; there is then ordinarly a great defect, in making uſe of Chriſts Interceſſion, as if it could not in that caſe avail us, and upon this follows anxiety and fretting; and the Believer is ready to conclude, he will be nothing the better of prayer, and that it is better to pray none then to pray ſo; whereas an eye to Chriſts Interceſſion would give the mind ſome quietneſs. 3. If there be an ill and very neceſſitous caſe; or if there be challenges, and ſome commotion, diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure and diſquiet be in the ſpirit, there is readily little reſpect had to Chriſt; If quietneſs, and calmneſſe be, there is alſo hazard of ſitting down on that, and we readily forget that we hold it of him; And indeed it will be found difficult, either to have or to want, and in either the one caſe or the other to be making right uſe of his Interceſſion: Now when I ſpeak of this Sin, it not only reproves them that pray none at all, which ſmells of groſſe Atheiſm, but alſo theſe who ſhuffle by Chriſt, and ſtep forward at the neareſt, as if they were not to come to God by him; As it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. and <hi>John</hi> 14.6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of this Sin, and whence it comes to paſſe, that folks ſo ſlight the uſe-making of Chriſts Interceſſion. 1. There is a great difficulty in the thing, it's tickle. 2. There is an natural averſneſſe from, and enmity at that thing in us, 3. There is a readineſs to pitch on ſome other thing, and to miſken, and over look this; now let all theſe <hi>Three</hi> be put together; and we will ſee the reaſon and way, how folk ſlide and fall into this fault.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay, There is a difficulty in the thing, It being one of the moſt purely ſpiritual, ſublime and denyed things, in all the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; one of the greateſt exerciſes of Faith, and we know that all ſuch things have to our nature a great difficulty. 1. It's a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to bring a man to be but formal in Religion, 2. There is a difficulty, when he is made formal to make him ſerious
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:152256:283"/> even in a legal manner, and to be any thing affected in the exerciſe of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and of other duties; So that he be not groſly deſſembling. 3. When he is made thus ſerious, it's a difficulty to bring him over that ſeriouſneſs; and to draw him from reſting on theſe duties, which he hath been drawn to; I ſay, it's a great and difficult work to get a man brought to the performance of holy Duties; and as great a work to get him brought over them, and from reſting on them, to reſt on Chriſt's Righteouſneſſe for his Juſtification, and on Chriſts Interceſſion, for the acceptance of his prayers; And therefore when the Lord hath once gotten His Diſciples to pray, and honeſtly yoaked and ingaged therein; He trains them on to pray in His Name, and ſo to get their prayers rightly qualified. 2. If we conſider our nature, we will find that there is an averſneſs, &amp; backwardneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to it; as there is an averſneſſe in us, to all things that tend to the making us deny our ſelves; and lay the weight of every thing on Chriſt; That which thwarts with our pride, ſtands and ſticks at our ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks (to ſpeak ſo) and goes not well down with us; of ſuch nature is this; For our uſe-making of Chriſts Interceſſion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes, that we of our ſelves are at a diſtance with God, that we have broken Covenant, and are not to be truſted without a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; and there is in our nature, a ſecret ſort of diſdain at this; We cannot naturally indure it; Hence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. It's ſaid of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that being ignorant of Gods Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, they did not ſubmit, nor ſtoop to the ſame; but ſought to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſſe. 3. There is a readineſſe to pitch, and condeſcend almoſt on any other Sin, rather then on this; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore folks may be longer under it, then under many, and yet not be challenged for it; They will readily be challenged for Lying, Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, and the like; but they ſleep more ſecurely in this Sin then in moſt others; It is a Sin eaſily fallen into, and a Sin not eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from, or win out of; Becauſe it is a Goſpel-ſin, that the light of nature reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, and that the Conſcience hath not ſuch an aw i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> convincing of, It's againſt natures light to neglect prayer, or to take Gods name in vain; but this runs in the Channel of the Goſpel, to pray in the name of Chriſt, and to make all our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to God through Him? The ſinful neglect whereof cannot be diſcovered, but by Goſpel-light: And we find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that many will be convinced of, and have challenges for out-breaking Sins, who yet wil have no challenges for the neglect of this duty; Even as it is eaſier to convince folks of a breach of the Law then of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt; many will grant that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God is a Sin, and that irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and wandering in prayer are Sins, who yet will ſtand and ſtick at this, and cannot be gotten convinced, but that they ſtill believe in Chriſt, and make uſe of his Interceſſion.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Third,</hi> To wit, the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies and prejudices of this evil, they are very many; we ſhall only hint at them, for they are dierectly oppoſit to the good that comes by the improving of Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion. 1. It makes many prayers to be fruitleſs, and fruſtranious, though folks ſhould weary themſelves in prayer, yet it is all but loſt labour, and the Lord will ſay as it is, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1. <hi>Though ye make many prayers, yet I will not hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> them,</hi> if Chriſts Interceſſion be neglected; but one word put up in Chriſts name hath a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hearing. 2. It makes many prayers, and other duties alſo to be lifeleſſe; No duty goes with folks, neither can it go with them when Chriſt is ſlighted; Seing it is by Faith in Him, that we have Life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to us, whereby we are made lively in every thing. 3. It hath much anxiety following on it; To be praying, and to have no expectation, nor ground of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a hearing; For if we look no further than to ſomething in our ſelves, it is but a poor foundation of quietneſſe and peace. 4. It hath this prejudice, that it inures, habituats, and accuſtomes us to a low eſteem of Chriſt, and makes us want many ſweet experiences that we
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:152256:284"/> might have of his uſefulneſſe, and worth, and it foſters a diſreſpect to Chriſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the uſe making of his Interceſſion, keeps alwayes up an eſteem of him, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>kes the thoughts of him freſh, and it is ever well with the Soul while he is eſteemed of, and it is impoſſible it can be well when he is not in requeſt.</p>
            <p>Now, ye may eaſily gather what all this aims at, even that ye may not ſatisfie your ſelves wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the form of Dutie; but that ye may look that it be rightly diſcharged, ſo as Chriſt in his Offices, and particularly in His Prieſtly Office, and more particularly in this part of it, be made uſe of: It may be, there are ſome here that have been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſtians theſe 20, 30, or 40. years, But I would inquire at you, what uſe have ye made all the while of Chriſts Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? The neglect of this is a Sin againſt mercy, a Sin againſt your own Souls, and the cauſe of many other Sins; therefore take it among your reproofes, that not only ye have neglected prayer, lived in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and taken his name in vain, but that ye have alſo long profeſſed Faith in Chriſt, and yet have not made uſe of Chriſts Interceſſion; This will be amongſt your ſaddeſt challenges when ye come to ſickneſs, and to your death-beds, and ye will have it heavily charged on you, That there hath been great ſlighting, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening of Chriſt, even when ye thought what ye were praying to him.</p>
            <p>In the 4. place, To clear it yet further, we ſhall 1. Hint at ſome ſymptomes, or evidences of neglecting of Chriſts Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. 2. At ſome Characters of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is making uſe of Chriſts Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aright. 3. At ſome Directions that may help to the ſuitable performance of this duty, And 4. At ſome Motives, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the Symptomes, or Evidences of miſkening, and ſlighting of Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion. 1. This is one, when there is little walking under the impreſſion of the need of His Sacrifice, when folks walk whole-heartedly (to ſpeak ſo) and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due conviction of the diſtance that is betwixt God and them; For Chriſts Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion flows from His Satisfaction, and the improving of His Satisfact on flows from the conviction of our natural diſtance from God; when folks are not ſenſible of their enmity, and of their vileneſs, and ſee not their need of waſhing, when they have a heal heart, few challenges, little exerciſe of repentnce, and of ſelf-loathing, it's a great evidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there is little or no uſe made of Chriſts Interceſſion. The 2d. Symptome is deep ſecurity, and much ſelf-confidence; where theſe are Chriſts Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, is little, or not at all made uſe of; When a Soul makes no queſtion of, nor nor hath any doubt about it's own peace, or about it's praying or getting a hearing, This is indeed ſelf-confidence and does flow from the former, to wit, Ignorance of our diſtance from God; which is clear both from experience, and from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; They that make leaſt uſe of Chriſts Interceſſion, and have moſt carnal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, have readily feweſt challenges: Thus the <hi>Phariſee</hi> ſtands, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. and prayes, ſaying, <hi>Lord, I thank thee,</hi> &amp;c. The greateſt part of ſuch folks prayers is thanksgiving on carnal grounds, Whereas the poor Publican dare not come near, but when the Phariſee comes boldly forward, He <hi>ſtands a far off,</hi> and ſayes, <hi>Lord be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to me a ſinner,</hi> Who, (as if he had ſaid) have a reſpect to the Covenant of Grace, and ſo to the improving of Chriſts Interceſſion; It's certainly an ill token, when folks ſit down with confidence to their prayers, and riſe up from them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all fear of being denyed, and ſaid nay. A 3d. Symptome of not making uſe of Chriſts Interceſſion, is, when folk have too much anxiety, which is a fault that a Believer may eaſily fall in, when he hath no ground from himſelf to propoſe to God for a hearing and when he cannot anſwer his own challenges, and is therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; which ſayes, that he lippens not much to Chriſt, and to His Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A 4th Symptome is, When duties of worſhip become burdenſome, when it wearieth folk to pray, to ſanctifie the
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:152256:284"/> Lords Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when theſe are faſhions, and cumburſome to them; The reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, becauſe they take the burden whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or moſtly on themſelves, and lay it not over on Chriſt; Whereas, were he rightly made uſe of, it would be found to be a truth, That <hi>His yoke is eaſie, and his burden light,</hi> as himſelf ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.30. A 5th Symptome is, When folks are not thankful for any mercy they receive, and are not wondring how it comes that they get ſuch mercies as they have; when they think little of their dayly bread, of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, of acceſs to Pray &amp;c. Souls that are improving Chriſts Interceſſion think much of any mercy, becauſe the leaſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is quite without the reach of the merit of ought they can do, and muſt come to them by the Mediation of another; Thus every mercy becomes a double mercy, as it is conſidered in it ſelf, and as it comes to them by vertue of Chriſts Interceſſion, therefore the Believer Improving Chriſts Interceſſion, wonders at every thing he meets with from God; that he is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to pray, or to praiſe, for he knows, that it's from free-grace thus admitting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners through, and by a Mediator.</p>
            <p>As to the 2d, To wit, The Characters, or evidences of a perſons making uſe of Chriſts Interceſſion, The 1. may be this, A conſtant uſe-making of Chriſts Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when the Soul is never quiet, but when it hath a reſpect to that, And this uſe-making of Chriſts Satisfaction, hath in it, always either more implicity or more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly an uſe-making of his Interceſſion and leaves the weight of duties and mercies upon Him; Hence a Soul will be under through conviction of it's enmity; and very much edged and eager in it's deſires after peace, and will have expectation of obtaining it through Him. A 2d. Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is, When folk in their approaches to God, have Faith and Fear going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; Anxiety and Fear without Faith are not good, and Self-confidence without Fear is as ill; But when Faith and Fear go together, it's good; Fear ariſing from the impreſſion of our own unworthineſſe, and diſcovered diſtance; and Faith from the diſcovery of Chriſts fullneſſe, keeping the mind quiet, looking over it's own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, to His worthineſs, like to that ſpoken of <hi>Noah, Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>By faith, Noah moved with fear, prepared an ark;</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption will not hold up with Fear, and therefore, when the Hypocrite is ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, he turns anxious, becauſe the ground that he leans to is ſhaken; neither is that which is ſuppoſed to be Faith, good without Fear, for it turns to ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but Fear is good, having confidence mixed with it, for it ſayes, that there is a lippening to ſomewhat elſe then any thing in the Soul it ſelf. 3. They that make uſe aright of Chriſts Interceſſion, betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it, when in a manner they have given over, and been formerly hopeleſs, like theſe ſpoken of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. <hi>Then they cry in their diſtreſs,</hi> &amp;c. Many have a confidence, becauſe they were never brangled nor ſhaken, and have win to quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe this way, even as it is in the matter of making peace with God, many will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they alwayes had it, even from their youth up, they never doubted of it, which ſpeaks it's unſoundneſs; but it is a ſolid evidence of Faith, when the Soul hath once been brangled and ſhaken, and this gives it confidence, that Chriſt hath Satisfied, and makes Interceſſion, and they betake themſelves to that. 4. Where Chriſts Interceſſion is improven and made uſe of, it will be ground of rejoycing, and comfort to think on it, when Souls them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves can do little: being bound up, and under bonds, yet they cheer themſelves, and bleſs God, that they know they have an Advocat; I apprehend there are many to whom it was never refreſhful, nor mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of gladneſs, that He is an Advocat, or that He ſtands in ſuch a relation to plead for Sinners, ſurely ſuch have not made uſe of Him. A 5th Evidence is this, When any thing is attained, the improving of Chriſts Interceſſion makes thankful and humble; If the Soul have liberty, it is not puffed up with it, becauſe it conſiders that it's a mercy come through Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:152256:285"/> it hath received it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould not boaſt; it's not of it's own procurement, but it's obliged to Free-grace for it. 6. The Soul that is improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts Interceſſion, when it obtains not, it gives not over, but continues ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereing, and waiting for attaining of that which it is ſeeking; the cauſe of ſuch a Perſon is never quit deſperat; if it be a thing conditional it's ſubmisſive, if it be ſimply neceſſary, it's dependent, and will not quit, nor give over, becauſe, though it obtain not to day, it knows it's poſſible to attain it, and that it will in due time be attained; it layes not the weight of it's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining on its own prayers, but on Chriſts Purchaſe and Interceſſion; And though the Believer may be ſometimes aſſaulted, and ſet upon to quit his ſuit, and then his Faith is brangled, yet he leaves it not ſo. 7. It is a difficulty to the Believer, to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t Chriſts Interceſſion rightly depended on, and made uſe of when he prayes, this is as great a difficultie to him, as to get words, and greater; As it is one piece of his exerciſe in prayer to get words, affection, and reverence; ſo it is another piece of his exerciſe, to get his prayer accepted through Chriſts Interceſſion; it is here as in Juſtification, it is one part of his exerciſe to do Duty, and another part of his exerciſe to be denyed to it, and made to betake himſelf to Chriſts Righteouſneſſe allanatly for his acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but other Perſons that make not uſe of Chriſts Interceſſion, if they get words, and any bit of tenderneſſe, they think all is well enough; But it is a Believers exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe to ſee that his mind miſcarry not in the uſe-making of Chriſt. 8. Souls that are improving Chriſts Interceſſion, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence is not up or down according to their liberty, Words or Reaſons, they win to make uſe of in prayer, but they are up or down according as they win to get the thing they ſeek committed to Chriſt; Hence a word, or look will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times quiet the Soul, when at another time many hours prayer will not do it; For this is ſure, ſo long as the thing reſts on our ſelves, the Soul get<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> never a kindly lair, and that which puts it off our ſelves over on Chriſt, is the exerciſe of Faith, and nor Liberty, nor the multitude of Words; At another time a Believer wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l riſe from prayer, and not ſeriouſly look whether Chriſt have been depended on, or not, but is quiet, becauſe he hath prayed; Whereas, when Chriſts Interceſſion is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven, he is quiet on that ground, that it is God that is prayed to; through Chriſt; it's that which gives him ground of confidence to expect a hearing, and on that his Soul reſts when he hath done praying: And therefore we would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this to you, in place of many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions that might be moved on what ye have heard, Even to carry a diſtinct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in your boſome to theſe <hi>Two,</hi> whether when ye are going to pray, or when ye have done with prayer, 1. To whom are ye to pray, or have ye been prayIng? That it's the great God, that one God, the maker of all things, who ought alone to be worſhipped, that being properly, and formally the Object of your worſhip, and particularly of this your prayer. 2. Upon what ground do ye hazard to put up a ſuit to this great God, and what is it that gives you confidence to expect an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer? It's that, not for any righteouſneſs or worth in your ſelves, or in your prayers, but for Jeſus Chriſt, for His Satisfaction, and Interceſſions ſake; When ye can give a diſtinct anſwer from the Conſcience in reference to theſe <hi>Two,</hi> though there be not ſuch diſtinctneſſe in other things, to wit, That it is God ye pray to, and that ye expect a hearing on Chriſts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it's right.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Third</hi> thing, What is it that will help us to make uſe of Chriſts Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion? <hi>First,</hi> conſider that it's our duty; Souls often minde not, that God hath not ſimply bidden them pray, but command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to pray in the name of Chriſt; He hath nor bidden us ſimply approach to him, but to approach to Him, in and by Chriſt; This would be remembred, elſe we forget the half of our duty, to
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:152256:285"/> wit, the manner how we ſhould come to God, which is a main, if not the main part of it. 2. We would remember and think upon our condition by nature, that upon the one ſide, God is a conſuming fire, and we on the other, like dry ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and that there is no approaching to Him without a Mediator; There were the leſs hazard of going wrong, if folk were walking under the ſuitable impreſſion of their ſinfulneſs and miſery by nature; the want whereof makes too much forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in ſteping into God without Chriſt; Therefore we commend to you all, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when ye go to prayer, to endeavour, to be under deep impreſſions of your own ſinfulneſs and baſeneſs; As we ſee it was with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>Behold now I have taken on me to ſpeak to the Lord, who am but dust and aſhes.</hi> 3. Mind the promiſe of Gods hearing you through Chriſt, and His promiſe of leading you in all neceſſary truth, and ſo to perform duty in this manner; Minde I ſay, 1. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of hearing, that it's not a promiſe to hear us ſimply in what we pray for, but in wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t we pray for with other requiſit qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of prayer, and with this in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, That it be in Chriſts Name; Hence is <hi>Asking in his name,</hi> ſo often mentioned, <hi>John</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, and 16. <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24, 26. To mind that there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of hearing, draws a Soul to pray to God, and to minde that the promiſe is made to praying thus qualified, to wit, that it be in Chriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Name; binds the Soul to this way, becauſe otherwiſe it forfaults the Promiſe, if it obſerve not the due qualification; I fear there are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who look on the Promiſe as abſolute; It's true. Though there are abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the Covenant, yet there are other Promiſes that have qualifications and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, whereof this anent hearing of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is one, and we are to expect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Promiſe, when we ſeek after the qualification and condition. 2.

That ye have a promiſe to be heard. 3. That ye have a Mediator to interceed for you. 4. That a promiſe is given you to learn how to make uſe of Him, and that though the uſe-making of His Interceſſion aright be difficult, and many do miſken and miſtake it, yet that by the eying of the Promiſe, ye may win to the right uſe-mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; ye would by any means eye the Promiſe, that ye be not miſtaken; It may be there is a look now and then to liberty, and it is good in it ſelf, but there may be a defect here; That ye look not to Chriſt to be helped to pray with liberty, and to be guided to pray in His Name, ſo as to lay the weight of your being heard on Chriſts interceſſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly. When there hath been an eying of the Promiſe, not only for the thing we ſeek, but alſo to be guided in the ſeeking of it; ye would be often taking a review of your ſelves in, and after prayer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye be indeed praying, and have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſts Name, that when the Soul looks back, and ſees it hath much miſken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and neglected Chriſt, it may take it ſelf in this evil, and disclaim it, and ſettle it ſelf on a right ground; In a word, there would be looking well on the one ſide, that Jeſus Chriſt be the ground we build on, and on the other ſide, that when we eye Chriſt, and build on him, we be not afraid to hazard on Him; For into one of theſe extreams we readily run, either to lippen and lean to ſome other thing then Chriſt, or, if we ſee no other thing to lean and lippen to, and be neceſſitate to eye Him, we diſtruſt Him, and are loath to hazard on Him.</p>

To incourage us to, this way, not to be doing duty only, as men under the Law, but as Chriſtian men under the Goſpel, with reſpect to Chriſts Satisfaction and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion; And, <hi>First,</hi> For preſſing it, conſider, that there is a neceſſity of it in reference to as many prayers as are accepted of God; If it be neceſſary to get a hearing, fit's neceſſary to pray in Chriſts Name; It a may be many think it to be but an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing that we have been preſſing ll the while that we have been ſpeaking of Chriſts Interceſſion; but indeed it's of more moment then our preſſing you to any exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duty; for the external duty of prayer, though it muſt needs be gon about, is yet but the carcaſe, this is the Soul and Life of Prayer; And therefore let me exhort and obteſt you, never to ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ming them, that is, That they be done in Chriſts ſtrength, and that ye reſt on Him, for the acceptance of them; It's as neceſſary to worſhip God in and by a Mediator, as it is to worſhip the only true God, and not to worſhip a falſe, or ſtrange God. I make no queſtion, but moſt part of the hearers of the Goſpel, do deſtroy themſelves here, by reſting on their legal performances, and not making uſe of Chriſt 2. For your incouragement, conſider that it is moſt advantagious and profitable; Theſe words in the Promiſe are broad and full, <hi>Whatſoever ye ask in my name, I will do it,</hi> And the Promiſe is frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in theſe forecited Chapters of <hi>John;</hi> O! what calmneſs, tranquility, peace, vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory over anxiety, what patience in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether, when in bonds or in liberty, do flow from the exerciſing of Faith on this ground, to wit, That we have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat in Heaven with the Father; further conſider the great ground of confidence that he hath given us, that we ſhall come ſpeed in this way, which ſhould ſtir us up, hearten and incourage us to it, which wil manifeſtly appear, if we joyn theſe <hi>Two</hi> together. 1. That this bleſſed Advocat is our Brother, that He was made like unto us in all things except ſin; that He is a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-feeling high Prieſt, that is touched with our infirmities, that He refuſeth to grant no ſuits of His People that are for His glory, and their good, that He ſaves all to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by Him; none could ever ſay that He refuſed to take their Cauſe in hand, when they indeed committed it to Him. 2. That when a Cauſe is committed to Him, it cannot but carry, and be ſuccesful, for as He is Man, ſo He is God, and He is heard alwayes; Thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is no ſtranger we have to go to, and there is good ground of confidence, that when we go, we ſhall come ſpeed; Therefore let Him ever be gone unto more and more; and bleſſe God heartily, that He hath given ſuch an high Prieſt unto Sinners, <hi>Who is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come unto God through him:</hi> Now to this God, who can effectually teach us to make uſe of the Mediator every way, and particulary in His Interceſſion, ſuitably and ſuccesfully, And <hi>who is able to do exceeding abotnaantly above all we ask, or think, according to the power that worketh in us, be glory in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus throughout all ages, world without end,</hi> Amen.</p>
